To give all users access to GRASS 5 put 
/opt/GNUgrass/bin in the path for the users, e. g.:
export PATH=\$PATH:/opt/GNUgrass/bin
or add the path to the system wide or users .profile file. 

Now you should be able to start grass with:
grass5

Alternatively you can create a link with:
ln -s /opt/GNUgrass/bin/grass5 /usr/local/bin/grass5
or similar. 

If you have installed the libraries in a directory which is not in the
default library search path (e. g. /opt/sfw/lib) you may: 

1) create softlinks to /usr/lib 
2) export LD_LIBRARY_PATH before starting grass, from a configuration file,
like .profile
3) add the directories system-wide to the search path, e. g. use crle -u -l
/usr/local/lib to add the path to the configuration file /var/ld/ld.conf, see
man ld.so.1 and man crle for more details."
