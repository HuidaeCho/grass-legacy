The code is stable, but I'm still just shy of editing. I recently finished
the brush section of the property sheet, but I'm sending this out without
the editing functionality finished. You should be able to play with the
property sheet, and query the cells values displayed by clicking the mouse
on the map.

I'm interested in any and all bugs that you discover. I would also be
interested in comments and suggestions.

The celleditor should be run from within the grass shell, so that all those
grass environment variables are set.

Notes on compilation:
   I've been using imake to handle the makefiles because I'm more worried
   about the problems of X dependencies, and search paths than potential
   GRASS problems. You should edit the DEFBRUSHDIR symbol in the Imakefile so 
   that it points to where the brushes will be installed. If you have an MIT
   distributution of X11R4 installed correctly on your system, you should be 
   able to simply.

   % xmkmf
   % make Makefiles
   % make depend
   % make
   % make install
   
I haven't done much testing (any) on potential compilations problems as I
don't have another system to try this out on. If you have any trouble
compiling, or other problems/suggestions just drop me a note. 
I'll be arounf all next week (via e-mail) to help you with probelms, if need
be I can call you at a mutually agreeded upon time.

Frank.
