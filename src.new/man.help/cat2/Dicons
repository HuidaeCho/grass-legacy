NAME
     Dicons - Tool for graphically displaying points, as icons,
     in the current window
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dicons [color [size [type [file]]]]
     Dicons [option=value] [option=value] ...

DESCRIPTION
     Dicons graphically displaying point locations as icons in
     the current map window.  Coordinates are read either from
     standard input or from a file stated by the file option.
     Options can be stated either positionally or explicitly on
     the command line (see DINTRO[2D]).  Dashes (-) can also be
     inserted positionally on the command line to indicate use of
     default values for specific options.  Options are:

     color=color
          Sets the current color to that stated.  Options are
          red, orange, green, blue, indigo, violet, black, white,
          gray, yellow, brown, and magenta.  The default used
          when no color is specified is white.
     This program resulted from a quick hack on the Dpoints
     program and it could probably use some testing.  It was not
     developed under under contract to CERL, its just a little
     give-away.

     Diconss will locate a point at the location specified, even
     if it is outside the current window.

     A size option should be added to this so that the user can
     control the sizes of the icon.
     Note that output from the GRASS Gsites command can be
     redirected directly into Dicons.
