NAME

     MlulcUSGS - creates grid cell layers from a  Composite  Them
Grid
     (CTG) file created by Mlulc.read.  Mlulc.read  extracts  the
CTG
     data from an ASCII landuse/landcover (lulc) CTG format file
     supplied by the USGS.
     (Map Development Tool)

SYNOPSIS

     Mlulc.USGS INFILE

DESCRIPTION

     Mlulc.USGS creates the following grid cell layers  from  the
CTG file
     created by Mlulc.read  and  places  them  into  the  current
Mapset:

         1. Land Use & Land Cover
         2. Political Units
         3. Census Units
         4. Hydrologic Units
         5. Federal Land Ownership
         6. State Land Ownership

     Since the CTG file may not contain all of the above  layers,
Mlulc.USGS
     will extract only the  grid  cell  layers  which  have  been
supplied.

     The  CTG  file  contains  all  of  the  window   information
necessary for
     creating the grid cell layers including:

         1.  Grid Zone
         2.  Projection Type (UTM)
         3.  Cell Resolution (ew_res = nw_res)
         4.  Multi-bye data formation
         5.  window coordinates

     Mlulc.USGS will use the window information supplied with the
CTG file
     and NOT the window currently set for the user's mapset (Note
that
     this is different from many of the other Mapdev Commands).

     When Mlulc.USGS is executed, it will check the  file  for  a
specified
     layer and then ask you if you wish to extract the grid  cell
layer.
     You will then be prompted for the name  of  the  cell  file.
Mlulc.USGS
     will then create the cell file and all support files.

EXAMPLE:

     The following example extracts grid cell data from  the  CTG
file lulc
     which contains only LAND USE/LAND COVER data:

       Mlulc.USGS lulc

       MAP TITLE: DODGE CITY, KS 1:250,000 LU, PB, CN, HU, FO
       The Composite Theme Grid file contains <1> overlays
       and has a map code type of <01>

       Do you Wish to Create <LAND USE/LAND COVER> Grid Cell(y/n)
[y] y

       Enter File Name for LAND USE/LAND COVER Overlay
       Enter 'list' for a list of existing grid cell files
       Hit RETURN to cancel request
       > landuse

       Creating <landuse> from <LAND USE/LAND COVER> Overlay: 95%
       Number of Categories: 76  (UNLABELED)
       Writing Cell Header Information
       Writing Color Table Information

       Conversion is Complete

BUGS

     Mlulc.USGS does not  currently  extract  census  unit  data.
Also, only
     the cataloging unit is extracted from the CTG file (see  the
Land
     Use and Land Cover Data Users Guide supplied by the USGS).
