     Dscale2 [option=value] [option=value]...

DESCRIPTION
     Dscale2 displays a scale and North arrow in the current It
     is automatically proportioned to fit appropriately in the
     upper left corner of the current But it can also be position
     by UTM coordinates or with the mouse.  If you change the
     position of the scale it may not all fit in the display
     window.  It is drawn twice in two different colors; the
     default (if unspecified on the command line) is the use of a
     white scale on a black background.  Options are:

     color1=color
          Color used for the first drawing of the scale
          (background).  Default is black.
     color2=color
          Color used for second drawing of the scale (offset).
          Default is white.

     Available colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
     indigo, violet, gray, brown, magenta, white, and black.
     Background and offset colors can be stated either
     positionally or explicitly on the command line.

     easting=east-value
          Value used for the geographic easting of the upper left
          corner of the scale.
     northing=north-value
          Value used for the geographic northing of the upper
          left corner of the scale.
     mouse=[1/0]

          interactively with the mouse.  A 0 (default) indicates
          that the mouse not be used.

BUGS
     Dscale2 assumes that units are in meters.
     The scale that Dscale generates is not suitable for very
     tiny maps.
