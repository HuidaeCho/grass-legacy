     NAME
          Gdbsites - RIM data base management/query interface for
          GRASS

     SYNOPSIS
          Gdbsites data_base

     DESCRIPTION
          Gdbsites  allows  you  to  create,  manage  and   query
information
          about site locations (sites) across the landscape in  a
batch
          mode or interactively, with input  in  a  command  line
style.
          Operations are done on a data base through a command
          language defined below. The  program  dbsites  performs
many of
          the same functions in a friendly,  menu-driven  format.
These
          programs  are  actually  a  marriage   of   the   GRASS
environment
          and  the  programmer's   interface   library   of   the
relational
          data base management program RIM distributed publically
by
          the  University  of   Washington   Academic   Computing
Services.

          The site data bases are stored in a subdirectory  named
'rim'
          in the user's current  mapset.   Data  bases  in  other
mapsets,
          selectable through the GRASS mapsets command, can be
          accessed for 'read-only' retrieval  of  records.   Each
mapset
          may have many data bases.   Each  data  base  within  a
mapset
          must have a different name;  user  supplied  names  are
limited
          to  seven  (7)  characters   in   order   to   maintain
compatibility
          with the standard version of RIM.  As with other GRASS
          commands,  mapsets   are   searched   in   the   mapset
SEARCH_PATH
          order when a data base needs to be opened.

          Each site data base is composed of multi-field  records
(rows
          or  tuples,  in  DBMS  jargon).   Each  field  and  its
position in
          the site form is defined via input to the .make command
when
          a data base is originally defined.  It is  possible  to
add
          new fields or change  the  length  of  existing  fields
after
          data   has   been   loaded,   however   this   is   not
straightforward;
          deleting of fields is also possible, but requires  even
more
          experience and knowledge.  The user needs to carefully
          design the data base fields  and  form  and  check  the
operation
          with a few pieces of test data before loading  a  large
number
          of sites.

     COMMANDS
          The commands are given alphabetically here for easy
          reference. The .make command is required  to  create  a
data
          base and, therefore, will be the first to be entered by
a
          new user.  Abbreviations down to the string shown in  (
) are
          accepted; this is primarily for  those  using  Gdbsites
from a
          terminal, but abbreviations may also be used  in  batch
files.

          Each command is introduced with an input record  (line)
which
          starts with a period and is  followed  by  one  of  the
words

          shown below; for some commands the command line also
          contains one or more required or optional parameters.
          Additional or optional input  instructions/data  for  a
command
          is supplied on successive lines; a .end line is  needed
by
          some commands to signify the end of these lines.

                       Alphabetical Command Summary


          !command
               This is the only  Gdbsites  command  not  starting
with a
               period.  "command" is a single shell command  line
which
               is executed by a "G_system()" call (see GRASS gis
               library).  Many  UNIX  utilities  (e.g.,  vi,  ls,
print,
               etc.)  and  most  GRASS  commands  (e.g.,   Dcell,
Dpoints,
               list, window, mask, etc.) may be executed within a
               single run of Gdbsites. (It is permitted to change
               "window" and "MASK" within Gdbsites. ) Multiple
               commands may be separated by ";" in  the  standard
UNIX
               way.  Note that a "!cd directory; ls" will  change
to
               the specified directory and list files, but the
               effective working directory for Gdbsites will  not
be
               changed when the command terminates.

          .add (.a)
               Add a new site record (row) to the open data base.
               Each line following contains a field name followed
by
               spaces and/or tabs then  the  value  or  character
string
               to store for that field.  Field information  lines
end
               with .end.  Some fields may be absent  and  fields
may
               appear in any order.   Checks  are  made  for  the
input of
               data for the one required field (site number), for
               string length for  string  type  fields,  and  for
duplicate
               site numbers.  If split fields  are  used  in  the
data
               base layout (see .make), text data for each  split
field
               must be added as a separate line.   If  there  are
any
               problems, the record will  not  be  stored  and  a
message
               will be output.  This format makes  it  relatively
easy
               to import data from most other DBMS.  The  ".print
-l"
               command, see below,  outputs  data  in  this  list
format.

                    Example:
                     .add
                     site_id   204
                     north     4690673.30
                     east      601410.00
                     reference Jones (1987)
                     .end

          .backup (.b) file_name
               The .backup command is used  to  dump  the  entire
data
               base from the RIM binary  files  to  a  text  file
format

               (see  UNLOAD  in  the  RIM  User's  Manual).   The
file_name
               can be a relative path name  or  full  path  name.
The
               file will contain the data base definition, screen
               layout information, and tabular data.   This  text
file
               is transportable to RIM or Gdbsites running on any
               other  computer;  it  may  also  be  reloaded   to
recreate the
               Gdbsites data base.  A message will be  output  if
there
               is any problem writing the .backup  file.   Backup
can
               only be done on data bases in the user's current
               mapset.

               To reload your data  base  from  the  backup  file
(normally
               not necessary):

                    GRASS> cd $LOCATION/rim     #right directory
                    GRASS> rm db_name.rimdb*    #remove data base
                    GRASS> rim                  #run RIM manually
                    RIM>  input  "path/file"       #RIM  rebuilds
data base
                    RIM> exit

          .change (.c)
               Each line following .change is in the same  format
as
               for the .add command.  The site number field is
               required  and  the  site  number  must  match   an
existing
               site in data base.  Only those  fields  for  which
lines
               are provided are changed in the record.  After the
.end
               the changed  record  is  stored,  if  all  is  ok,
otherwise a
               message is output.

          .delete (.d)
               This command is used to delete  data  records  for
sites.
               The lines following  the  command  should  contain
only the
               site  numbers,  with  a  .end  line  being   last.
Deletion of
               sites is permanent.  A backup of the data base  is
the
               way to protect your valuable data.  The following
               command  sequence  will  delete  all   the   sites
currently on
               the internal site list (the  result  of  the  last
.query
               or .find command) after asking for approval.

                     .delete
                     .end

          .end (.e)
               Ends multi-line input for several other commands.

          .exit (.ex)
               Use .exit to end operation  of  Gdbsites  cleanly.
In
               general,  do  not  use  CTRL-C  to   exit   unless
absolutely
               necessary.  When .exit is encountered in  a  batch
file,
               input will revert back to the  previous  file,  or
the
               terminal, if any, which called the batch file.

          .find (.f) [mask | current]
               The .find command is  used  to  find  the  site(s)
closest
               to a given point (the target) in  one  of  several
ways,
               and store the sites on an internal sites list for
               output by other commands;  however,  see  note  2,
below.
               The found sites are stored on the  internal  sites
list
               in order of proximity to the target location.  The
               optional .find command line parameter gives
               instructions regarding using the current MASK,  if
any,
               or  the  current  window,  as  a  filter  on   the
retrieved
               sites.

               The single required line following the .find  line
gives
               the program the necessary target information.  The
               following examples show the possibilities.

                    find> 602793.90 4379010.00

               will find the one site nearest  these  coordinates
and
               store it on the internal site list.

                    find> 619840 4599000 10

               will find the 10 sites (or fewer, if there are not
that
               many) closest to the given location.

                    find> site 132 10

               will find the 10 sites closest to the location  of
site
               132 in the data base  (including  site  132).   No
action
               if site 132 does not exist.

                    find> distance from 472910.06 5732001.0 5000

               will find all sites within 5000 (meters in UTM
               coordinates) of the target location.

                    find> distance from site 16 -2500

               will find all sites  greater  than  2500  (meters)
from the
               location of site 16.

               Notes for .find:

               1.  All sites found are stored on the site list in
               order of proximity to the target location  (sorted
by
               distance from target).

               2.  The coordinates and site numbers of all  sites
found
               are automatically printed to the active output
               device/file in a fixed format.

Gdbsites(2G)



               3.  If mask is specified, the effective window is
               automatically set to the current  window  (because
the
               GRASS  mask  is  only  defined  for  the   current
window).

               4.  Window and mask filtering uses the current
               resolution for the window to test if a point falls
               within a cell.

               5.  In the last two examples the string  "distance
from"
               must be exactly matched.  Also,  the  word  "site"
must be
               exactly matched.

               6.  If the "distance from" radius is given as a
               negative value, points outside the  target  circle
are
               selected; whereas, if a positive value  is  given,
points
               inside the circle are selected.

               7.   The  current  window  may  be  changed   with
!Gwindow...
               or !window or !d.window prior to  doing  a  .find,
and the
               mask may be set or removed with a variety of GRASS
               commands.

               8.  The "find>" prompt is given only when input is
from
               a terminal.

          .help (.h)
               Prints a help screen to the output device or file.
               Useful  to  have  when  using  Gdbsites   from   a
terminal, or
               when writing a script file of commands.

          .input (.i) [file]
               The lines in the file given are read and processed
as
               commands or data until an end of file  is  reached
or
               until a .exit command is found.  Input  files  may
call
               other input files to a  nesting  depth  of  eight.
Without
               a file name stdin is  used  as  the  nested  input
file.

          .list (.l)
               Lists the available  data  bases  in  the  current
mapset
               search path.

          .make
               Using the .make command you create a new data base
in
               the current mapset  by  specifying  the  following
items
               which  define  the  screen   (page)   layout   for
displaying
               and printing the site records, as well as the
               information fields:

                    1)  The fixed text part of the screen layout.
                    2)  The positions, types, and lengths of data
                    fields.

               Three fields must always exist  in  a  data  base;
each of
               these field types may only occur once  in  a  data
base
               layout:

                    1) Type 's'  Site identification number field
(an
                    integer).
                    2) Type 'x'  Easting coordinate of  the  site
(a
                    double float).
                    3) Type 'y'  Northing coordinate of the  site
(a
                    double float).

               The other field types, which may occur in any
               combination and order, are:

                    4) type 'i'  An integer field.

                    5) type 'f'  A double precision float field.
                                 (always 2  decimal  places  used
for output)

                    6) type 't'  A text field.

               Each of the  fields  can  be  positioned  anywhere
within
               the screen layout, which has a limit of  19  lines
by 80
               columns.  A maximum of 70 fields  may  be  defined
within
               this space.  A field is specified  in  the  screen
layout
               by a tilde (~), a field type  character,  a  field
name
               and enough trailing tildes to fill out the desired
               field length.

               Each line following the .make command is taken to
               define a line of the screen layout until a .end is
               reached.  If a mistake is made on any of the input
               lines, the .make will fail.  The .make information
may
               be prepared  in  advance  as  a  text  file  (this
facilitates
               fixing mistakes) and the  .input  command  can  be
used to
               read in this file.  An example  text  file  for  a
data
               base screen layout follows, with some  explanatory
notes
               and restrictions.

               Notes:

               1)  Any text not preceded by a tilde (~) character
is
               taken to be part of the  constant  or  fixed  text
portion
               of the form.

               2)  A field definition begins with a tilde (~)
               character  immediately  followed   by   a   single
character
               which  indicates  the  data  type  of  the   field
(s,x,y,i,f
               or  t).   Immediately  following  the  data   type
character
               is the field name of 1 to  16  characters.   Field
names
               can  be  composed  of  any  characters  from   the
following
               set: [A-Z,a-z,_,]; the RIM program and library  do
not
               distinguish upper and lower case in  field  names,
so you
               should avoid making names  which  differ  only  in
case.
               The rest of the field length is padded with  tilde
(~)
               characters.

               3)  The minimum field width is  three  characters;
e.g.,
               "~tA".  Be sure field widths for  all  fields  are
wide
               enough for the values and strings  you  expect  to
store
               there; e.g., UTM northings  require  at  least  11
spaces.

               4)  For text fields it is possible to  continue  a
field
               across more  than  one  line.   This  is  done  by
appending a
               .1 to the field name forming first portion of this
               "split field", a .2 for the second  portion,  etc.
This
               text field splitting affects how information is
               organized for input and output; the composite text
               string is concatenated (unused portions of  fields
are
               retained as spaces) and  treated  as  a  unit  for
storage
               and queries to the data base.

          .output (.o) [file]
               Causes all output from Gdbsites (except some error
               messages) to go to the  named  path/file.   If  no
file is
               given,  output  returns  to  stdout,  usually  the
user's
               terminal.

          .pack (.pa)
               This should be used  when  numerous  data  records
have
               been deleted or changed to recover disk  space  in
the
               RIM binary data base files.  It works by doing a
               .backup to a temporary file; moving the data  base
files
               to new names (*.bakdb*); running  RIM  to  rebuild
the
               data base; and, if the rebuilt data  base  can  be
opened
               and read, the temporary files  are  deleted.   The
user is
               informed if this process fails.  Packing can  only
be
               done on an open data base located  in  the  user's
current
               mapset.

               This command outputs the full site records for the
               sites currently stored on the internal sites list
               (result of last .query  or  .find).   Without  the
flag,
               the screen layout format is  used.   With  the  -l
flag,
               for list format, the field name followed by the
               contents are output one field per  line.   The  -a
flag
               also outputs in the list format but  with  a  .add
line
               and a  .end  line  surrounding  each  site  record
printed;
               data files in this form can be read  with  .input,
thus
               they form one kind of backup mechanism and can  be
used
               to transfer data (not the data base  layout)  from
one
               GRASS system to another.  The destination for the
               output  is  set  by  a  previous  .output  command
(default is
               stdout).

          .query (.q) [mask | current]
               The .query command is used to retrieve  sites  via
an
               SQL-like  request  to  RIM,   including   a   user
specified
               "where clause." All fields for each  site  meeting
the
               selection criteria are retrieved.

               The optional .query command line parameters cause
               points  not  in  the  window  and/or  mask  to  be
rejected, so
               these conditions need not be tested in the "where
               clause."

               After the query command line, any number of  lines
may
               be entered to define the SQL  "where"  clause.   A
.end
               line is required to finish the request  and  begin
data
               retrieval.  See examples below.

               The "distance from" clause may also be used as
               additional selection criteria exactly as described
in
               the examples and notes  for  .find.   It  must  be
entered
               as a separate line to the query prompt.

               Example 1

                    query>  where  density  <  20  and  (date   =
"10/14/89"
                    query> or county eq "San Marcos")
                    query> .end

               Example 2

                    query>  where  east  <600000  and  name  like
"*Jones*"
                    query> distance from site 12 3000
                    query> .end

               Example 3

                    query>.end

Gdbsites(2G)



               The where  and  distance  from  clauses  are  each
optional.
               If both are omitted, only the mask and  window  on
the
               .query command line restrict the search;  if  mask
and
               window  are  also  omitted,  all  sites  will   be
retrieved
               (Example 3).  When querying for  sites  the  where
clause
               is processed first, the current  window  and  mask
tested
               (if requested), then the distance from clause is
               applied; a site must pass all tests to be  put  on
the
               internal site list for output by other commands.

               Notes:  (Also see Notes for .find)

               1.  The retrieved sites are stored on the internal
site
               list in the order returned from the data  base  by
RIM,
               not necessarily in site number order or the  order
the
               data was loaded.

               2.  See the RIM User's Manual for additional
               information on the "where" clause in the "select"
               command,  especially  the  quotes   required   for
matching
               character string fields.

               3.   The  RIM  sort  clause   is   not   currently
implemented,
               but will be in future versions of Gdbsites.

               4.   In  the  where  clauses  of   the   examples,
"density",
               "date", "county", east", and "name are field names
               (column  names  in  RIM)  defined  when  the  user
initially
               makes the data base.

               5.  Each .query or .find resets the internal  site
list.

          .read_site (.re) site_list
               This command will read an existing GRASS site list
and
               create a data base record for each  site.  If  the
comment
               or description field of all entries  in  the  site
list
               begin with # and a number, the number becomes  the
site
               number in the data base.  If some of the sites  in
the
               GRASS site list do not have a # at  the  beginning
of the
               comment field, the sites are numbered sequentially
               starting with 1.  (These options  are  similar  to
the way
               the  GRASS  sites.to.cell  works.)   If  the  site
number
               duplicates one already in the data base or found
               earlier in the site list, it is not added.

               Once the sites have  been  loaded  by  .read_site,
use
               .change to add data  to  other  fields  for  those
sites.

          .remove
               This command, which requires a "y" as confirmation
on
               the next line, entirely removes the  three  binary
files
               which constitute your RIM  data  base.   Use  with
care.

               Backup files must be removed individually  by  the
user,
               if desired.

          .show (.sh)
               This command is used to output the screen or page
               layout as defined for the current data  base.   It
serves
               as documentation of the data base  definition  and
as a
               reminder for field names, types and lengths.  By
               surrounding the output of .show with .add and .end
               lines, it can be used to reload the data base
               definition with .input.

          .site_list (.si) file_name [field_name]
               This command writes the  site  locations  and  the
site
               numbers to the specified file in the site_list
               directory in the  current  mapset.   If  the  file
exists,
               the  sites  are  appended  to  the  current  list,
otherwise,
               a new site list file is created.  A  "field  name"
may be
               optionally specified; if so, the contents of  that
field
               (retrieved from the appropriate site record) are
               inserted as the comment (following a '#')  in  the
site
               list.  The site number is used if no field name is
               supplied.

               A line is inserted in the site_list file with the
               current date and time and the  name  of  the  data
base
               producing the site locations.  The format used for
each
               site is:

                    easting|northing|#comment

          .tables (.t)
               Prints the table structure of the currently opened
RIM
               data base.  This is the same output generated by a
               "list *" command when running RIM manually.  The
               information for the table named "data"  is  useful
for
               review of the user's field definitions.  The
               information  for  the  two  other  tables  is  for
internal
               use by Gdbsites.

     NOTES
          1.  The sort clause  for  the  query  command  will  be
functional
          as soon as the RIM library  routines  are  debugged  at
Univ. of
          Washington.

          2.  A "date" type  field  should  be  added  to  future
versions.
          This version only allows storing of  dates  as  strings
(unless
          the user codes them to integers), and thus only  string
type
          searches can be made for dates.
