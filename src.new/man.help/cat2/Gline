NAME
     Gline - Create a new vector (digit) file by extracting
     linear features from a thinned cell-file.
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gline cell-file digit-file [option=value] [option=value]

DESCRIPTION
     Gline scans the named cell-file and extracts thinned linear
     features into a vector (digit) file.  Options are:

     format=format
          Format of the digit file, either binary or ascii.
          Default is binary vector (digit) files.
     attrib=attribute_type
          Attribute type of the extracted vectors, either linear
          or area_edge.  Specifying linear will cause extracted
          vectors to have linear attributes.  Specifying
          area_edge will cause extracted vectors to have
          area_edge attributes.  Default is linear attributes.

     Gline assumes that the input cell-file has been thinned
     using Gthin.


NOTES
     Gline extracts vectors from a cell file that represent
     linear features or arcs in digit terminology (i.e. roads,
     streams, political boundaries).  These arcs may denote
     linear attributes (roads or streams), or may denote an area
     edge attribute (political boundary).  The attribute type
     option allows you to set linear or area edge attributes for
     all of the extracted vectors.

     The GRASS Tool Gpoly may be used to extracts vectors from a
     cell file that represent area features (i.e. classes of
     soil, ranges of elevation).

     You will need to run support.vect on the resultant vector
     (digit) files to build the dig_plus information.

     Gthin and Gline may create excessive nodes at every
     junction, and small spurs or "dangling lines" during the
     thinning and vectorization process.  These excessive nodes
     and spurs may be removed by Gtrim.


BUGS
     The input cell-file MUST be thinned by Gthin , if not Gline
     may crash.
