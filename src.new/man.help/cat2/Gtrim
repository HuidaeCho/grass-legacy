Gtrim(2G)            GRASS Reference Manual             Gtrim(2G)



NAME
     Gtrim - Trim small spurs, and remove excessive nodes in a
     digit file
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gtrim digit-file trimmed-file [trimming-factor]

DESCRIPTION
     Gtrim scans the selected digit-file and removes all lines
     with a length less than the specified trimming factor.
     Excessive nodes between line junctions are also removed.
     Gtrim will create a new vector data file.  The original
     vector (digit) file is not modified.

     The trimming parameter gives you control over the size of
     small spurs or "dangling lines" to be removed.  The trimming
     factor is expressed in the same units (coordinates) as the
     vector (digit) data within the current Grass Location, (i.e.
     meters for UTM locations, and in pixels or cells for non-UTM
     locations).

     The default trimming factor is 10 (either meters or cells,
     depending upon the current location).


NOTES
     support.vect must be run prior to Gtrim.

     support.vect must be run on the resultant files to build the
     dig_plus information.

     Gline maintains the same format (binary or ascii) and
     attribute type (linear or area edge) as the original digit
     file.

     A trimming factor of zero (0) will not remove any small
     spurs, but will remove all excessive nodes.
