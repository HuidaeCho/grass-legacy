Gthin(2G)            GRASS Reference Manual             Gthin(2G)



NAME
     Gthin - Thin non-zero cells that denote linear features in a
     cell file.
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gthin input-cell-file thinned-cell-file

DESCRIPTION
     Gthin scans the named input-cell-file and thins non-zero
     cells that denote linear features into linear features
     having a single cell width.

     Gthin will thin only the non-zero cells of the input-cell-
     file within the current window. The cell width of the
     thinned-cell-file will be equal to the resolution of the
     currently set window.  All of the thinned linear features
     will have the width of a single cell.

     Gthin will create a new cell data file containing the
     thinned linear features. Gthin assumes that linear features
     are encoded with positive values on a background on 0's in
     the input cell file.


NOTES
     Gthin only creates cell files.  You will need to run Gline
     on the resultant cell file to create a vector (digit) file.

     Gthin may create small spurs or "dangling lines" during the
     thinning process.  These spurs may be removed (after
     creating a vector file) by Gtrim.
