.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dicons
graphically displaying point locations as icons in the current map window.
Coordinates are read either from standard input or from a file stated
by the \fIfile\fR option.  Options can be stated either positionally
or explicitly on the command line (see \fIDINTRO[2D]\fR).  Dashes
(\fI-\fR) can also be inserted positionally on the command line to
indicate use of default values for specific options.  Options are:
.ns
.TP 
.RI color\*= color
Sets the current color to that stated.  Options are red, orange, green, blue,
indigo, violet, black, white, gray, yellow, brown, and magenta.  The default
used when no color is specified is white.

.ns
.TP 
.RI icon\*= name
Specify the name of a paint icon file to be used.
.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI file\*= input
\fIInput\fR is a UNIX file name.  Default, if unspecified, is standard
input.  The file contents should consist of a series of grid coordinates
that fit within the current map window (refer to \fIDstatus\fR for
map window coordinates).  These coordinates should be in the form of 
eastings and northings (in that order), separated by a single blank space.
.SH "NOTES"

This program resulted from a quick hack on the Dpoints program and it
could probably use some testing.  It was not developed under under 
contract to CERL, its just a little give-away.

\fIDiconss\fR will locate a point at the location specified, even if
it is outside the current window.

A size option should be added to this so that the user can control the
sizes of the icon.
.br
Note that output from the GRASS \fIGsites\fR command can be
redirected directly into \fIDicons\fR.
