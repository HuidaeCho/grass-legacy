.SH SYNOPSIS
.B profile 
.SH DESCRIPTION
Using
.I Profile 
you can view profiles of a cell-file map layer.   
.I Profile 
is intended for use with elevation cell-files.  A profile of an elevation
cell-file is a plot the shape of the land along a given line. 

.SH USER PROMPTS
First, you will be presented with a prompt asking you to choose a cell-file
to be used.  Once you specify a valid cell-file name, the cell-file will
be plotted in the left half of the graphics display, and the right half
of the dispay will be divided into four windows.  There will also be two
windows along the top of the display: a mouse-button menu window on the 
left, and a status window on the right.

The mouse-button menu initially offers you three options:

.nf
.in +5
Mouse Buttons:
   Left:        Where am I?
   Middle:      Mark FIRST Point of Profile Line.	
   Right:       QUIT this.
.in -5
.fi

You may query the displayed cell-file by indicating points with the 
left mouse-button.  The coordinates and category value of each point 
that you indicate will be displayed on in the status window.
If you mark the first point of the profile line you will be presented
with the following mouse-button menu:

.nf
.in +5
Mouse Buttons:
   Left:        Where am I?
   Middle:      Mark SECOND Point of Profile Line.	
   Right:       QUIT this.
.in -5
.fi

Once you mark the second point of the profile line, the profile line will 
be labelled (with a letter from A to D) and plotted in one of the 
four windows on the right hand side of the screen.  You will then
be presented with a third mouse-button menu:

.nf
.in +5
Mouse Buttons:
   Left:        DO ANOTHER	
   Middle:      CLEAR DISPLAY 
   Right:       QUIT this.
.in -5
.fi

If you would like to view another profile, click on the left mouse-button.
If you would like to replot the cell-file and clear out the four profile
windows, click on the middle mouse-button.  If you would like to quit,
then click on the right button.

.SH NOTES

Some enhancements that would be useful:

1) add an option to plot profiles using category colors, like a bar-chart.

2) allow profile lines to be defined by a series of points, not just two.

3) allow profiles to be saved in a file, for later viewing.

4) allow user to enter profile line points by typing coordinates.
