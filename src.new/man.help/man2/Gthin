.SH NAME
Gthin \- Thin non-zero cells that denote linear features 
in a cell file.
.br
.I "(G Language Tool)"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Gthin
.I "input-cell-file thinned-cell-file"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gthin
scans the named \fIinput-cell-file\fR and thins non-zero cells that 
denote linear features into linear features having a single cell width.

.I Gthin
will thin only the non-zero cells of the \fIinput-cell-file\fR 
within the current window. 
The cell width of the \fIthinned-cell-file\fR will be equal to 
the resolution of the currently set window.  All of the thinned linear
features will have the width of a single cell.  

.I Gthin
will create a new cell data file containing the thinned linear features.  
.I Gthin 
assumes 
that linear features are encoded with positive values on a
background on 0's in the 
input cell file.  

.SH NOTES
.I Gthin 
only creates cell files.
You will need to run 
.I Gline
on the resultant cell file to create a vector (digit) file.

.I Gthin 
may create small spurs or "dangling lines" during the thinning process.
These spurs may be removed (after creating a vector file) by  
.I Gtrim.
