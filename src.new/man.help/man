.SH NAME
.IP i.build.block\ \- 11
An imagery function that creates and edits blocks and sub-blocks 
of imagery groups for ortho rectification
.br
.I (GRASS Imagery Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B i.build.block
.SH DESCRIPTION
An imagery photo block consists of several scanned aerial photographs
(cell files) of a common area.  
An imagery sub-block is a subset of these cell files.

.I i.build.block 
allows the user to collect one or more imagery groups 
by assigning them to a named block and sub-block.
This enables the user to run ortho rectification programs 
on a single imagery group within a sub-block.

The user first creates all of the imagery groups with the 
.I (GRASS Imagery Tool) i.group.

The first menu in the \fIi.build.block\fR program asks the user to select
a \fIblock\fR.  If the block does not exist, the user will be asked if
he or she would like to create a new block.

.if t \fB
.nf
This program edits blocks of imagery groups for ortho rectification.
You may select or create blocks of imagery groups.
You may edit blocks of existing imagery groups.
You may create sub-blocks of imagery groups within the block.
You may select a TARGET location for the ortho-rectified blocks.
You may select an elevation data cell file from the TARGET location.
You may select a camera reference file for the block.

with value 0 (no-data) with another value. 
    
.IP "\fISelect a camera reference file\fR"
If option number 5 is selected, an entry
space is provided to type in the name of an existing camera reference file

.ne 14
.if t \fB
.ce 1
LOCATION: \fIlocation\fP   BLOCK: \fIdemo\fP   MAPSET: \fImapset\fP

\fR

If more than one MAPSET is selected, menus for those mapsets
will also be displayed.
All imagery groups selected with an 'x' will be included in the block being updated.

The user will then have the opportunity to check the contents
of the block that was just modified:
.ne 12
.if t \fB
.ce 2
Block [\fIdemo\fP] references the following cell files

\fR

If the user responds with the letter \fIy\fR then the following
sentence is displayed on the screen:

.if t \fB
.ce 1
Block [\fIdemo\fP] updated!
\fR

And the main menu for \fIi.build.block\fR returns.

If the user responds \fIn\fR, the menu containing
the block files after it was modified will be displayed and
the user will be asked to place an \fIx\fR in front of those imagery 
groups that
are to be removed from the block.  Then, a menu listing all of the
other imagery groups in the  current MAPSET will be displayed
again, and the user will be again asked to 
place an \fIx\fR in front of imagery groups to be included in the block.
This gives the user the opportunity to correct mistakes or
make changes in the choice of files to be selected in a block without
exiting \fIi.build.block\fR.

.IP "\fICreate a new subblock within the block\fR"
The following menu enables the user to create a subblock out
of a single imagery groups in the block.  Any number of subblocks
may be created by repeating the option.   

.ne 7
.if t \fB
.ce 1y
LOCATION: \fIlocation\fP                MAPSET: \fImapset\fP

.fi


.ce 2
AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
(OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)
\fR

After selecting or creating a subblock, this menu is displayed:

.ne 11
.if t \fB
.ce 1
Mark an 'x' by only one imagery group to form subblock [\fI13\fP]

.TS
center, tab(:);

(OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)
\fR

.ne 13
The user is then given the opportunity to check the contents
of the subblock:

.if t \fB
.ce 2
Subblock [\fI13\fP] references the following cell file

__________________
.TS
center, tab(:);
l l.

.ce 2

\fR

If the user responds with the letter \fIn\fR, the block menu will
appear again enabling the user to select another file to form the
subblock.

.SH NOTES
The \fIi.build.block\fR options are only available for imagery groups 
in the current LOCATION.

The ortho rectification programs in \fIi.rectify.block\fR currently are 
designed as single photo rectifications. Hence, only a single imagery
group may be selected for each sub-block.  In the future multi-photo
rectification may become available.
