NAME
     i.class -     An imagery function that generates spectral
                   signatures for an image by allowing the user
                   to outline regions of interest.  The resulting
                   signature file can be used as input for
                   i.maxlik or as a seed signature file for
                   i.cluster.
                   (GRASS Imagery Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     i.class

DESCRIPTION
     i.class performs the first pass in the GRASS two-pass
     supervised image classification process, while the GRASS
     program i.maxlik executes the second pass.  Both programs
     must be run to generate a classified cell map.

     i.class is an interactive program that allows the user to
     outline a region on the screen and calculate the spectral
     signature based on the cells that are within that region.
     During this process the user will be shown a histogram of
     the region for each image band.  The user can also display
     the cells of the image bands which fall within a user
     specified number of standard deviations from the means in
     the spectral signature.  By doing this the user can see how
     much of the image is likely to be put into the class
     associated with the current signature.

     The spectral signatures that result are composed of region
     means and covariance matrices.  These region means and
     covariance matrices are used in the second pass (i.maxlik)
     to classify the image.

     Alternatively, the spectral signatures generated by i.class
     can be used for seed means for the clusters in the i.cluster
     program.


USER INPUTS
     The first screen in the program i.class asks the user for
     the imagery group and subgroup to be analyzed:

     LOCATION: location       SUPERVISED CLASSIFIER        MAPSET: demo

           Please select the group/subgroup to be analyzed

    GROUP:      spot_______   (list will show available groups)
    SUBGROUP:   123________   (list will show available subgroups)


         AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                       (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)


     The group should contain the imagery bands that the user
     wishes to classify.  The subgroup is a subset of this group
     that the user must create by running the GRASS program
     i.group before running i.class.  This subgroup should
     contain only the image bands that the user wishes to
     classify.  Note that this subgroup must contain more than
     one band.

     After the first screen the program asks the user for the
     name of the resulting signature file.  The signature file is
     both the output file for i.class and the required input file
     for the GRASS program i.maxlik.  It contains the region
     means and covariance matrices that are used to classify an
     image in i.maxlik.

     After entering the resulting signature file name, the user
     is asked to enter the name of a seed signature file.  This
     is optional.  A "seed" signature file is a previously
     created signature file.  Such a seed signature file may be
     the result of an earlier run of i.class.  The seed signature
     file is copied into the new resulting signature file before
     any new signatures are added by i.class.  In this way, you
     can collect the work from several sessions with i.class into
     one signature file.

     Next, the user is asked to enter the name of the cell map to
     be displayed during the process of outlining regions.
     Typically, the user will want to enter the name of a color
     composite previously created by i.composite.  However, the
     user can enter the name of any existing cell map.  This
     leaves the potential for using a cell map not directly
     derived from the image as a backdrop on which the user can
     outline the classes of interest.

     At this point the i.class graphics screen will be drawn on
     the graphics monitor and the user will be direct to use the
     mouse.  From this point on the user will primarily work with
     the mouse, selecting options from the menus and outlining
     regions on the screen.  The only time that the user will
     need to return to the text terminal is to enter names for

THE MENUS
     All of the menus in the i.class program are displayed across
     the bottom of the graphics monitor in the Menu Window.  To
     select an option from one of these menus, simply place the
     cursor over your selection and press any button on the
     mouse.  Each of the menus are discussed in the following
     paragraphs.


The Command Menu
     The Command Menu includes the following selections:

     Zoom - This command allows the user to outline a rectangular
     region in either the Map or Zoom Display Windows and the
     region is displayed magnified to fit in the Zoom Display
     Window. A red rectangle is drawn in the Map Display Window,
     indicating what area the Zoom Display Window shows.

     To outline the rectangular region simply use any mouse

     button to anchor the first corner of the window and then use
     any button to choose the other corner.

     Define region - This selection takes the user to the Region
     Menu.  This menu includes the options that allow the user to
     outline a region of interest on the displayed cell map.

     Redisplay map - This selection takes the user to the
     Redisplay Menu.  The Redisplay Menu allow the user to redraw
     the map display windows.

     Analyze region - This selection starts the process of
     analyzing the currently defined region.  A histogram of the
     defined region will be displayed for each band.  On the
     histogram for each band, the mean, standard deviation,
     minimum cell value and maximum cell value are marked.  The
     histograms are automatically scaled in an attempt to fit the
     data into the space available, but it is possible that all
     of the data will not fit.  In this case, as much of the data
     as possible, centered around the mean, will be displayed.
     After the histograms are displayed, the user will be given
     the Signature Menu.

     Quit - The user should make this selection to end the
     session with i.class.



The Region Menu
     The Region Menu contains the following selections:

     Erase region - This selection erases any currently defined
     region.

     Draw region - This selection allows the user to use the
     mouse to draw a region on either the Map or Zoom Display
     Window.  An explanation of which mouse buttons to use is
     displayed in the Menu Window.  The user does not need to try
     to complete the region boundary.  The last line of the
     region will be added when the user selects the Complete
     region option on the Region Menu.

     Restore last region - This selection restores the last
     region that was drawn.  After a region is completed, it will
     be saved to be restored later.  Only one previous region is
     saved.

     Complete region - This selection completes the region that
     is currently being drawn.  As mentioned above, it saves the
     complete region to be restored later, if needed.  Once the
     user has made a complete region, it can be analyze with the
     Analyze region selection on the Command Menu.

     Done - Use this selection to return to the Command Menu.


The Redisplay Map Menu
     The Redisplay Map Menu has the following selections, which
     are useful to redraw the cell maps displayed in the Map and
     Zoom Display Windows.

     Map window - This selection causes the cell map in the Map
     Display Window to be redrawn.

     Zoom window - This selection causes the Zoom Display Window
     to be redrawn.

     Both - This selection causes both the Map and Zoom Display
     Windows to be redrawn.

     Cancel - Use this selection if you do not want to redisplay
     either of the above window.  The user will be returned to
     the Command Menu.


The Signature Menu
     The Signature Menu allows the user to set the number of
     standard deviations and the display color and then display
     (as an overlay) the cells that match the signature within
     the number of standard deviations specified.  Note that once
     the matching cells are displayed, the Map Display Window
     must be redisplayed to see only the original cell map again.
     The following selections are available on the Signature
     Menu:

     Set std dev's - This selection allows the user to set the
     number of standard deviations from the mean for the maximum
     and minimum range.  The maximum and minimum range is used
     when finding the cells that "match" the signature.  The user
     is presented with a menu of typical choices and an "Other"
     option.  If the "Other" option is selected, enter the number
     of standard deviations from the keyboard on the text
     terminal.  Otherwise, the selected option will be used.
     When the number of standard deviations is set, the
     histograms for each band will be redrawn with the maximum
     and minimum range marked.

     Note that the number in parentheses on this selection is the
     current number of standard deviations.

     Set color - This selection allows the user to set the color
     for the display of cells that "match" the current signature.
     The user is presented with a menu of color choices.  The
     color selected will be used when the Display matches menu
     selection is made.

     Note that the color in parenthesis on this selection is the
     current color for display.

     Display matches - This selection displays the cells that
     "match" the current signature in the current color.  A cell
     "matches" the current signature if the cell value in each
     band is between the minimum range and maximum range for that
     band defined by the number of standard deviations currently
     set.

     Done - When this selection is chosen, the user will be asked
     whether or not he/she would like to save the current
     signature.  If the user answers with the "Yes" selection,
     he/she will be asked to enter the signature name on the text
     terminal keyboard.  The signature name will be used by
     i.maxlik to name the category that is created from the
     current signature.  After either a "No" answer or the
     signature name is entered, the user is returned to the
     Command Menu.



NOTES
     i.class uses the MASK to generate the overlay for cells that
     match a signature.  As a result, the current MASK will be
     removed during the execution of this program.

     The cell values in the image bands cannot fall outside of
     the range of 0 to 255.  i.class will report an error if they
     do.

     i.class like some of the other imagery programs does not use
     the standard GRASS display windows.  After running i.class
     you will need to create a display window (with Dscreen for
     example) before you can use most of the GRASS D commands.

     i.group must be run before i.class to create an imagery
     subgroup containing the image bands to be classified.
