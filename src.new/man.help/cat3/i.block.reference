NAME
     i.ortho.reference -
                An imagery function that enables you to mark
                known reference points (fiducial marks, reseau
                marks, etc.) on an image to be ortho-rectified,
                and compute the image-to-photo coordinate
                transformation parameters.  The transformation
                parameters are required for the GRASS program
                i.rectify.block.
                (GRASS Imagery Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Selected from i.rectify.block

DESCRIPTION
     i.ortho.reference is an imagery function that enables you to
     mark reference points on an image to be ortho-rectified and
     then computes the image-to-photo coordinate transformation
     parameters.

     During the process of marking reference points with known
     photo coordinates, you may compute the RMS (root mean
     square) error for each reference point entered.
     i.ortho.reference does this by calculating the
     transformation equation (the same one that is calculated in
     the GRASS program i.rectify), and then plugging these
     results into an equation for RMS error.

     i.ortho.reference offers a zoom option to locate precisely
     the point to be marked on an image.

     To run i.ortho.reference, a graphics monitor is required.

     The procedure for marking reference points, entering known
     photo-coordinates, and analyzing the RMS error is described
     below.


     The terminal screen displays this message:

MARKING REFERENCE POINTS
     To mark the known reference points (fiducial marks, reseau
     marks, etc.) on the image, you must place the mouse cross
     hairs on the corresponding location on the image to be
     marked and press the left hand button on the mouse.  A
     diamond shaped symbol will be marked on the image.

     If you wish to use the  camera reference file only as a
     comparative reference,  then the keyboard can be chosen as
     the means to input photo coordinates corresponding to the
     marked reference points on the image.  This is done by
     placing the mouse cross hairs on the word KEYBOARD and
     pressing the left button on the mouse.

     The following menu is displayed on the graphics terminal:

   ________________________________________________________________
  | Point 1 marked at IMAGE COORDINATES|                          |

  |_______________________________________________________________|
  | Enter PHOTO COORDINATES as x and y:                           |
  |_______________________________________________________________|


     You then enter the known (x,y) photo coordinates, relative
     to the perspective center, for the  reference point marked
     on the image.  If you do not wish to enter a coordinate,
     simply hit RETURN to continue; the marked reference point
     will disappear.


     If you select the CAMERA FILE option, then reference points
     marked on the image will be associated with selected photo
     coordinates from the displayed camera reference file.  In
     this option, when you mark a point on the image, the

     following menu is displayed on the graphics terminal:

     If you would like to select the photo coordinates of a
     displayed reference mark, this can be accomplished by
     placing the mouse cross hairs on the reference point to be
     selected and pressing the left button on the mouse twice.
     After a reference point is selected from the display, you
     are prompted with "Look ok? (Y/N)".  If you respond with no,
     the reference point is ignored.  If you respond with yes,
     the following is displayed on the terminal:

     The photo coordinates and the corresponding image
     coordinates are automatically saved in a reference points
     file associated with the imagery group.


ANALYZE
     After a number of points have been marked (4 to 8), you can
     check the RMS error of the points marked on the image.  This
     is done by placing the mouse cross hairs on the word ANALYZE
     at the bottom of the monitor.  An error report resembling
     the one shown below is superimposed on the monitor:

     The RMS error for the image is given under the column titled
     "error" and subtitled "row" and "col".  In the above report,
     point number 1 is 0.0 rows and -0.9 columns from the
     predicted location calculated from the transformation
     equation. The RMS error for the photo coordinates is listed
     under the heading "photo".  This is the RMS error for the x
     and y coordinates of the photo coordinates but it is
     presented in the table using one general value.  The overall
     RMS error is displayed at the bottom of the screen in
     milimeters.  Points that create high RMS error are displayed
     in red on the monitor (represented here in italics).

     The location of the point marked on the imagery group file
     is given under the heading "image" and the subheadings
     "east" and "north".  The location of the point in the photo
     coordinates is given under the heading "photo" and the
     subheadings "x" and "y".  If you would like to exclude or
     include a point, this can be accomplished by placing the
     mouse cross hairs on the point number to be included (if the
     point is absent) or excluded (if the point is displayed) and
     pressing the left button on the mouse twice.  When a point
     is excluded, it is not afterwards included in the
     calculation of the RMS error, or included in the final
     transformation matrix.  However, it can be retrieved within
     i.ortho.reference at any time by double clicking with the
     mouse as described above.

QUIT
     To end the i.ortho.reference program place the mouse cross
     hairs on the word QUIT;  the marked reference points
     (including coordinates) will be saved.

NOTES
     A good rule of thumb is to mark at least 4 to 8 points which
     are evenly distributed over the perimeter of the imagery
     group file in order to obtain an accurate transformation
     equation for the i.ortho.control program.  The RMS error may
     increase with more points added, but the transformation
     equation will be more accurate.

     An RMS error of less than or equal to approximately one
     resolution unit (pixel) for the image being rectified is
     generally considered acceptable.
