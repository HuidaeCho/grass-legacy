This is not intended for general consumption as others at the U.
Washington are supposed to be working on dem extraction on a more
official basis (or be finishing this up).  This is a only a start.

Dem.extract, as it stands, probably only works with the
-nowin option I added.  This lets mdem.extract get its window
information from the file header and ignore current window settings,
and it is very useful for us.  Most of the code was rewritten, as
the previous code was ugly, confusing and broken.  May improvements
remain, though.  The data parsing seems to work well and output cell
data accurate however.  It works well for the basic case of converting
an an entire dem to a cell file.

I took out the blocksize stuff and it now only converts one file
at a time, as the previous code looked suspect.  These two tape
reading features may need to be put back if they really are necessary.
The program now reads from stdin if no input file is given.

We use it in a "batch" mode in a foreach loop, i.e.:
foreach file (*.dem.Z ...)
echo $file
zcat $file | Mdem.extract of=$file:r -nowin
end

Enjoy,
Philip
