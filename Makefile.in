# GRASS source code cleaning options:
#
# There are five options for cleaning the GRASS source code. The first four
# options are based on the GNU guidelines at:
#
# http://www.gnu.org/manual/make-3.77/html_node/make_118.html
#
# A fifth option is specific to the GRASS development project and does not
# conform to the GNU standard. Each option performs the following operations:
#
# make mostlyclean  	- delete all object files, the next step file, and the
#   	    	    	  binary install script if it exists, keep the compiled
#   	    	    	  GRASS libraries - good for saving disk space
# make clean        	- delete object files, next step file, libraries, and
# 		      	  generated directories like etc/ and dev/ - good for
#                     	  recompiling on the same system (keep configure files)
# make distclean    	- delete object files, next step file, libraries,
#   	    	    	  generated directories, head.${ARCH} file, configure files,
#   	    	    	  and Makefile - good for starting the whole
#   	    	    	  installation from scratch
# make maintainer-clean - delete object files, next step file, libraries,
#   	    	    	  generated directories, and generated lex/flex and
#   	    	     	  yacc/bison files - good for recompiling on the same
#   	    	    	  system and also generating the lex/flex and
#   	    	    	  yacc/bison files again
# make savebinclean    	- delete object files, next step file, the binary
#   	    	    	  install script if it exists, libraries, head.${ARCH} file,
#   	    	    	  configure files, and Makefile - good for deleting
#   	    	    	  everything but the binary files
