Gmakefile	* Processes the GRASS manual entries that are under man/man*
		  by running the man/utilities/Nroff script, and puts the
		  formatted man entries under man/cat*
		* Copies these formatted man entries from man/cat* to
		  the directories $MAN1 through $MAN5 under $(GISBASE)/man,
		  and the help entries from help.src to $(HELP).

    ************************************************************************
	NOTE:
    Follow these steps to print a single manual entry (assuming that you
    have loaded the GRASS source under the directory /grass5.0, so that
    the manual entries are under /grass5.0/man):
	% cd /grass5.0/man
	% tbl utilities/man.version manN/.class-header utilities/man.header \
	    manN/file manN/.class-notice | troff -t | lpr -t
    where "manN" is one of man1, man2, man3, man4, or man5, "file" is the
    file to be printed, and "oscar" is the printer on which to print it.

    You can also use the "tbl.nroff" and "imagen" scripts in the utilities
    directory, to create screen and laser-printer output respectively.
    To use them, type:
	% cd /grass5.0/man
	% sh utilities/tbl.nroff file
    or
	% cd /grass5.0/man
	% sh utilities/imagen file

    To print the entire reference manual, run the printed-manual script:
	% cd /grass5.0/man
	% sh utilities/printed-manual

    Note that by default, the script will attempt to print the entire
    manual: this is a large document, several megabytes in size and several
    hundred pages in length.  Only do this if you really mean it!
    
    Note also that the printed-manual script has options to produce other
    forms of output (troff source, troff final output, PostScript, etc.).
    See the script's comments for further information.

    The printed form of the reference manual, as produced by the
    printed-manual script, contains only three sections:
	- chapter 1 (main) and chapter 2 (alpha) entries, mixed together;
	- chapter 3 (scripts); and
	- chapter 5 (file formats).
    Finally, also be advised that the reference manual as produced by the
    printed-manual script has gaps in the page numbering to allow for the
    insertion of additional pages at the beginning of each chapter.  The
    documents that are inserted in these pages are *NOT* currently kept in
    these directories (but are available from the FTP site).
