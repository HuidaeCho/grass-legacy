GRASS is a product of the Center for Applied Geographic and Spatial 
Research (CAGSR) located at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.  GRASS was
originally developed bythe US Army Corps of Engineers Construction
Engineering Research Laboratories (USACERL), in Champaign, IL.  It is an
integrated set of programs designed to provide digitizing, image
processing, map production, and geographic information system
capabilities to its users.

Other agencies have also written programs for distribution with GRASS.
System development continues to be conducted by the GRASS Research 
Group at CAGSR.
