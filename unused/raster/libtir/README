README for libtir library


This library demonstrates a Type-Independent Raster programming.
Many developers have tried to program type-independent modules since
GRASS supported FP raster maps. However there is no standard method to
support different map types. Also, its method was troublesome to easily
program.

So libtir library is here. There are two examples so far: r.show and r.fill.

I'll add some documentation as soon as possible.
