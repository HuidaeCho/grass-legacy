DO NOT USE THIS MODULE FOR GENERAL PURPOSE.
It was created only to test raster-type independent programming method.

This may not fill sinks what you're thinking of because it computes sink
pixel by pixel, not by small sink area. So it only helps you fill isolated
NULLs or noises.

If I have a documentation on sink-fill, this module could be useful then.
