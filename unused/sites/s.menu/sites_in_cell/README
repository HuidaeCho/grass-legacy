README file for sites_in_cell     4-6-88   jaf

Michael: 

This code produces frequency counts of site point data at the 
current cell resolution of the window. I've kept this code under 
/usr/gis/src/sites/sites_in_cell. The makefile looks for site_count.h
in ../Include.  I've modified the main sites menu to include
an option for this function as number 7. Of course you should feel free 
to do anything you want to it. Call me if you have any questions.
