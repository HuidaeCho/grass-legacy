You will find the following files/directories here

	GISGEN      script which will compile GRASS
	VERSION     current version number and date of the GRASS release

	generic/    files need by gmake
		      gmake     shell script which does compilations
		      make.def  make variables
		      make.tail some additional make rules

	head/       gmake header file(s) for this site.

	lists/      lists of programs to be compiled
		      GRASS     standard GRASS programs
		      local     site specific GRASS programs
		      ...       architecture dependent GRASS programs

        tmp/        next_step.* files used by GISGEN to keep track
		    of how far along it is in the compilation. Used
		    to restart GISGEN (after a failure) where it left
		    off.
	
	utils/      contains the 'setup' script and all support scripts
		    and files needed by 'setup'


(1) User runs utils/setup

The utils/setup command creates a gmake header file. The contents of
this file are determined by examining the Unix system as well as asking
the user questions. The resultant header file is named by the user
(e.g., xxx) and place in the head/ directory. This header will contain
site-specific gmake variables.

The utils/setup command then copies the generic/gmake template to a
standard directory (e.g. /usr/local/bin) and modifies it so it knows
where GRASS has been installed and which header file to use.

(2) User examines head/xxx file to make sure things are ok (see
installation instructions.

(3) User creates lists/local and (optionally) lists/aaa.

These files contain the names of the GRASS src directories that are not
in the standard list of GRASS programs, but which are to be compiled
for the site. The lists/aaa file is an architecture-specific list which
allows NFS linked source code to compile one set of programs for one
machine, and another set for another machine. (The aaa is the ARCH
specified in the head/xxx file created by 'setup.') Both machines would
compile the lists/local.

(4) User runs GISGEN

GISGEN compiles GRASS. It creates/uses a file in tmp/ called next_step
(or next_step.aaa if ARCH aaa was specified in the setup).

If you want to start the compliation from the beginning, remove this
next_step file (if it exists). Otherwise, leave it alone ands GISGEN
will begin at the step specified in next_step.

When complete GISGEN will put the word DONE into the next_step file.
