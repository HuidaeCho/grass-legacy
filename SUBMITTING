Dear (new) GRASS Developer,

when submitting to GRASS CVS repositiory, please take
care of following rules:

- for programming style, please take a look at 
  STYLE_PROGRAMMING file

- place your module into the appropriate directory:
  - libes go into src/libes/
  - raster goes into src/raster/
  - vector goes into src/mapdev/
  - sites goes into src/sites
  - ...

- add the module's directory name (pointing to the local Gmakefile)
  to the compile list at src/CMD/lists/GRASS

- place the documentation in HTML format into html/html/ and
  add it to the module's list in html/
  Easiest way is to modify an existing HTML page for your purposes
  (to get the page style).
  The online WWW man pages will be updated over-night by CVS.

- Tell the other developers about it:
   grass5@geog.uni-hannover.de
 
  To subscribe to the list, see
  http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/grassdevel.html

- In case of question feel free to contact the developers at above
  mailing list.

That's it. We are glad to receive your contributions!
