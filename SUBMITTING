* PURPOSE: 	To provide functionality for GRASS programs to set and get

*  	    	variables for the duration of the program, or variables can be
*  	    	set permanently by adding them to the GISRC file. The get
*  	    	environment functions simply get the given variable from the
*  	    	environment regardless of whether it is permanent or not. 
*  	    	Functions are also provided to read and write the GISRC file.

- Place your module into the appropriate directory:
  - libes go into src/libes/
  - raster goes into src/raster/
  - vector goes into src/mapdev/
  - sites goes into src/sites
  - ...

- Add the module's directory name (pointing to the local Gmakefile)
  to the compile list at src/CMD/lists/GRASS

- Place the documentation in HTML format into html/html/ and
  add it to the module's list in html/
  Easiest way is to modify an existing HTML page for your purposes
  (to get the page style). There is a local README telling more details.
  The online WWW man pages will be updated over-night by CVS.
