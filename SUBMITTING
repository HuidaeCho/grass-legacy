Dear (new) GRASS Developer,

when submitting to GRASS CVS repositiory, please take
care of following rules:

- for programming style, please take a look at 
  STYLE_PROGRAMMING file

- Get the latest GRASS 5 Programmer's Manual here:
  http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/grassdevel.html

  or (better) grab it from CVS server (Latex):
    cvs -z3 co progmangrass50

- add your copyright into your module code like this:
  Example:

      /*
       * Copyright (C) 2000 by the GRASS Development Team
       * Author: Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan@intevation.de>
       *
       * This program is free software under the GPL (>=v2)
       * Read the file COPYING coming with GRASS for details.
       */
  This protects your rights according to GNU GPL (www.gnu.org).

- place your module into the appropriate directory:
  - libes go into src/libes/
  - raster goes into src/raster/
  - vector goes into src/mapdev/
  - sites goes into src/sites
  - ...

- add the module's directory name (pointing to the local Gmakefile)
  to the compile list at src/CMD/lists/GRASS

- place the documentation in HTML format into html/html/ and
  add it to the module's list in html/
  Easiest way is to modify an existing HTML page for your purposes
  (to get the page style). There is a local README telling more details.
  The online WWW man pages will be updated over-night by CVS.

- Tell the other developers about it:
   grass5@geog.uni-hannover.de
 
  To subscribe to this list, see
  http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/grassdevel.html

- In case of question feel free to contact the developers at above
  mailing list.

That's it. We are glad to receive your contributions!
