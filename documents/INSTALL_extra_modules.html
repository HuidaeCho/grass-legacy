<b>Compiling extra modules for GRASS GIS</b>

To compile extra modules (e.g. from untested section) you
have to perform two steps:


1. Enter the directory of the module where the Gmakefile is
   stored. If there are several Gmakefiles, enter the 
   "root directory" of this module.

   E.g.
     
   cd src.alpha/vector/v.in.shape
    
   The Gmakefile should be here.
    
1. Say
     gmake4.3
   there.

   If you are using GRASS 5.x, say
     gmake5.0

   The module will be compiled now. The GRASS libraries
   must have been compiled before. If not, you have to compile
   the GRASS package first. For that follow the instructions <a href=compile_grass.html>here</a>.

   If you should receive a compiling error, fix it and say 
     gmake4.3 
   again.

2. Now you have to include the module into the GRASS
   binary tree by using the script MAKELINKS.my.
   You find this script in
 
    src43/src/CMD/

   Go there and say
    MAKELINKS.my

   The script will create links for all modules again
   including you new module.

  That is all... Start GRASS and use the new module.
