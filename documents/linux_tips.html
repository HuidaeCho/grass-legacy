You still have problems with this release?

Problems with the ps.map command:

Solution:
       1. the ps.map needs to be compiled with the -fwritable-strings flag
       2. the way is to edit the src/CMD/head/linux header-file
             + add -fwritable-strings at the end of COMPILE_FLAGS line
               COMPILE_FLAGS = -O -fwritable-strings
             + cd to src.alpha/ps.map
             + run gmake4.2
             + cd to src/CMD
             + run MAKELINKS.my
