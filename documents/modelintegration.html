<h3>Erosion modelling: ANSWERS - r.answers</h3>
<menu>
 <li> The acronym for Areal Non-point Source Watershed Environmental Response
     Simulation model. This event-oriented, distributed parameter model is 
     designed for erosion, sediment and water quality control planning on 
     complex, agricultural watersheds.
 <li> It should normally be distributed in your GRASS-package. Note: ANSWERS is 
      written in C and FORTRAN, and will require a C compiler and a FORTRAN 
      compiler such as f77.

<h3>Erosion modelling: AGNPS 5.0 - r.agnps_input/r.agnps_run50/r.agnps_view</h3>
<menu>
 <li> AGricultural Non-Point Source (AGNPS) is a distributed parameter model
developed by Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists and engineers. It
predicts soil erosion and nutrient transport/loadings from agricultural
watersheds for real or hypothetical storms i.e., it's an event-based model.
Erosion modeling is built upon the USLE applied on a storm basis; thus, it uses
the EI-index for single storm events. Its hydrology is based on the Soil
Conservation Service Curve Number technique. AGNPS uses another ARS developed
model named CREAMS to predict nutrient/pesticide and soil particle size
generation and interaction. Here is a <A HREF=http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/phygeo/grass/agnps.html>  AGNPS Page</A>. 
Some help about using AGNPS can be found <A HREF=http://pasture.ecn.purdue.edu:80/~engelb/agen526/>here</A>.
Note: AGNPS 5.0 is written in C.

<h3> Erosion modelling: KINEROS - r.kineros</h3>
<menu>
 <li> KINEROS represents a watershed as a set of related elements.  
      Elements may be hillslopes, channels or ponds.  A computational order 
      must be specified so that boundary conditions for an element, such as 
      the amount of water contributed by lateral hillslopes and upstream 
      tributaries, are available.

<h3>Storm water runoff: r.water.fea</h3>
<menu>
<li> r.water.fea is an interactive program that allows the user to simulate 
 storm water runoff analysis using the finite element numerical technique.
Infiltration is calculated using the Green and Ampt formulation. r.water.fea
computes and draws hydrographs for every basin as well as at stream junctions
in an analysis area. It also draws animation maps at the basin level. The 
software is stored in GRASS 4.2.1

<h3>Runoff Calculation - Water Resource Assessment Tool: r.wrat</h3>
<menu>
<li>     The Water Resource Assessment Tool is a collection of
programs run within the GRASS GIS. These programs are an aid
in understanding the nature of runoff in a study area based
on information typically available for a GIS. The programs
analyze the terrain to define drainage direction and areas,
simulate runoff and peak runoff and model nonpoint source
pollution and map contaminant source areas and contaminant
pathways. 
</menu>


<h3>Hydrologic modelling: r.hydro.CASC2D</h3>
<menu>
<li>r.hydro.CASC2D is a physically-based, distributed, raster
hydrologic model which simulates the hydrologic response of a watershed
subject to a given rainfall field. Input rainfall is allowed to vary in 
space and time. Major components of the model include interception, 
infiltration, and surface runoff routing.  Interception is a process whereby 
rainfall is retained by vegetation.  Interception is estimated using an 
empirical three parameter model.  Infiltration is the process whereby 
rainfall or surface water is pulled into the soil by capillary and 
gravity forces. The Green and Ampt equation with four parameters is applied 
to model the event-based infiltration. For continuous soil moisture 
accounting, redistribution of soil moisture can also be simulated whenever 
the non-intercepted  rainfall intensity falls below the saturated hydraulic 
conductivity of the soil.  The redistribution option requires two more soil 
hydraulic parameters.  Excess rainfall becomes surface runoff and is routed 
as overland flow and subsequently as channel flow. The overland flow routing 
formulation is based on a two-dimensional explicit finite difference (FD)  
technique, while two different FD techniques, one explicit and
one implicit, provide options for routing one-dimensional channel flow.
Through a step function, a depression depth may be specified, below which no
overland flow will be routed.

<h3>SWAT hydrologic model</h3>
The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is the hydrologic model
used in the SWAT/GRASS linkage (USDA/Arnold and others, 1995). SWAT
is a continuous-time, basin-scale hydrologic model capable of
complex long-term simulations including hydrology, pesticide and
nutrient cycling, and erosion and sediment transport. It is a river basin scale model 
developed to quantify the impact of land management practices in
large, complex watersheds. SWAT is a public domain model actively 
supported by the USDA Agricultural Research Service at the
Grassland, Soil and Water Research Laboratory in Temple, TX.

<h3>Watershed Calculation: r.watershed</h3>
<menu>
<li> The series of programs provided within the watershed menu is
effective for the delineation and segmenting of channel net-
works, and for identifying a watershed  boundary.   Work  is
continuing to increase the effectiveness of delineating sub-
basin boundaries as well.
<pre>
1.  Filtering of elevation data
2.  Locating pits
3.  Calculating drainage accumulation/outlining watershed
4.  Creating stream network
5.  Coding stream segments/finding segment lengths
6.  Finding subwatershed basins

<h3>Floodplain Analysis: f.input etc.</h3>
<menu>
<li>f.input reads the results of the HEC-2 Water Surface Profile model
and generates a vector map of water surface elevations at hydraulic
sections.  The user supplies to f.input a vector map of the hydraulic
cross sections used in the HEC-2 model along with the HEC-2 model
results.
<li>f.econ takes as input the results of f.wsurf along with a
user-supplied vector map of building sites and two ASCII files of
economic data.  As output f.econ generates a vector map of total
damage to each building in the floodplain along with a summary ASCII
report of flood damages categorized by building types (residential,
public, ...) and damage type (structure or content).  f.econ also
reports areal extent of flooding.
<li> f.reach provides floodwater statistics, including areal extent of
flooding, average flood depth, and volume of water, calculated on a
reach-by-reach basis.

<h3>Landscape Analysis: r.le</h3>
<menu>
<li> Since the 1970s, with the availability of satellite data, there has
     been an increasing interest in the structure of the earth on the scale of kilometers 
     or hundreds of kilometers.
    Landscape ecology is a multi-disciplinary pursuit, involving geographers,
     biologists, sociologists, remote sensors, and many others.  The focus 
     of landscape ecology is on the dynamics and structure of the biosphere, 
     including human activities, on the scale of hundreds of meters to
    kilometers (Risser et al. 1984; Forman and Godron 1986; Urban et al. 1987). 
      The science of landscape ecology expanded rapidly in the 1980s, and 
     methods for the quantitative analysis of landscape structure also were 
    developed (e.g. Mead et al. 1981; Gardner et al. 1987; Milne 1988; 
    Griffiths and Wooding 1988), yet there is no generally for the 
    quantitative analysis of landscape structure that will work within a
    geographical information system (GIS).
    The r.le programs have been designed to provide software for calculating
    a variety of common quantitative measures of landscape structure.  The 
    programs can be used to analyze the structure of nearly any landscape. 
    <p>
    The r.le programs are designed for analyzing landscapes
composed of a mosaic of patches, but, more generally, these programs are 
capable of analyzing any two-dimensional raster or array whose entries are
integer values.  The r.le programs have options for controlling the shape, 
size, number, and distribution of sampling areas used to
collect information about the landscape.  Sampling area shapes can be
square, or rectangular with any length/width ratio or can be circular with 
any radius.  The size of sampling areas can be changed, so that the landscape 
can be analyzed at a variety of spatial scales simultaneously.
Sampling areas may be distributed across the landscape in a random,
systematic, or stratified-random manner, or as a moving window. The r.le 
programs can calculate a number of measures that produce single values as
output (e.g. mean patch size in the sampling area), as well as measures that
produce a distribution of values as output (e.g. frequency distribution of 
patch sizes in the sampling area) (Table 1), and it is also possible to output tables of data about selected
attributes (e.g., size, shape, amount of perimeter) of individual patches, as 
well as to make new maps of patch attributes.  The programs include no 
options for graphing or statistically analyzing the results of
the analyses.  External software must be used. - <a href=http://www.uwyo.edu/a&s/geog/faculty/links/rle.html>r.le web page</a>

<h3>Wildfire spread simulation: r.ros/r.spread/r.spreadpath</h3>
<menu>
<li> This WIldfire SPread Simulation, WiSpS, package contains three GRASS
programs r.ros, r.spread and r.spreadpath
<li> r.ros (for wildfire spread simulation) - Generates three, or
     four raster map layers showing 1) the base (perpendicular)
     rate of spread (ROS), 2) the maximum (forward) ROS, 3) the
     direction of the maximum ROS, and optionally 4) the maximum
     potential spotting distance. 
<li> r.spread - Simulates elliptically anisotropic spread on a
     graphics window and generates a raster map of the cumulative
     time of spread, given raster maps containing the rates of
     spread (ROS), the ROS directions and the spread origins. It
     optionally produces raster maps to contain backlink UTM
     coordinates for tracing spread paths. 
<li> r.spreadpath - Recursively traces the least cost path
     backwards to cells from which the cumulative cost was
     determined.
