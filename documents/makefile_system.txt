Notes to keep in mind for the new Makefile system

==============================================================================

The general methodology for the new Makefile system is

configure
make
make install

The important thing is that the first make must compile the entire program and
grass must be runnable for a local user (say in /home/jdoe). That is, a user
should be able to compile and run grass all within their $HOME directory
without having to need root access. Then for other users to be able to run it,
you need root access and do a "make install". The only thing "make install"
does is copy the required files from the compilation to the installation
directory (/usr/local/). Thus GISBASE cannot be ${prefix}/grass (which it is
currently defined as) in this case, but instead it should be ${srcdir}. That
way, the code is compiled under the user's home directory and he/she will be
able to run grass without installing it for system wide use.

The main problem that this will cause is that the grass5 script that will be
copied to the installation bin directory in "make install", will have GISBASE
pointing to the wrong place, inside the user's home directory, instead of
${prefix}/grass. However, this should be solved simply by substitution during
the make install.

==============================================================================

The directory structure of the installation should be determined by configure
with the following defaults, which come from the "GNU Coding Standard" located
at

http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards.html

prefix	    	/usr/local
exec_prefix 	${prefix}
bindir      	${exec_prefix}/bin
libdir	    	${exec_prefix}/lib -- replaces GISBASE/lib
includedir  	${prefix}/include -- replaces GISBASE/include
mandir	    	${prefix}/man -- replaces GISBASE/man
