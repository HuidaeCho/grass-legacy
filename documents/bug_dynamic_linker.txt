Regularly this bug meets GRASS:

    BUG IN DYNAMIC LINKER ld.so: dl-version.c: 210: _dl_check_map_versions: 
    Assertion 'needed != ((void *)0)' failed! 

What you can try:

* You might take a look at the program and at the shared libraries it
  uses with "objdump -R" and see if (and where) any odd relocation types
  show up.

* Check that your libraries have not been corrupted. 

* Problem with libstdc++xxxx.so ? How many libstdc's are present on your
  system (and where)?

* Which gcc version?
  gcc -v

* Did you install Mesa? Try running 'ldconfig' to
  update the symlinks in /lib, /usr/lib, etc. if you missed that command.
