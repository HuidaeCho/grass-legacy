You have found this file here:
    http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/
It will also be stored on:
    http://www.baylor.edu/~grass/

 
1. Install lesstif:
   
   You find the lesstif package on page
   http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/main_source.html
      - lesstiff (version 0.83, from 4. Feb. 98)
        

   It has to be compiled separately
           - install package somewhere
           - say: configure
           - say: make
           - say: make install
           - say: make clean
           - feel happy

   Successfully tested on Linux 2.x, gcc 2.7.1.

   Great - thanks to the lesstif-developers!


2. Compilation of XGRASS:
           - Change gmake4.2 to HASMOTIF=yes
             or use xgmake4.2 
           - uncomment the xgrass-directory in src421/src/CMD/lists/GRASS

           - Then you should be able to compile XGRASS without Motif


-> Tell me your improvements :)
