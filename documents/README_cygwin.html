This directory contains the WINDOWS/Cygwin binary code of
GRASS 5.0 in zipped format.
<p>
This is the first version with experimental graphical map output.
<p>
<HR>
<b>REQUIREMENTS:</b><br>
There are three major requirements to run GRASS 5 on WINDOWS: The "CygWin"
which provides a UNIX compliant environment and the Xserver which allows
to use GRASS' graphical output. Finally the "IPC" package is needed to
allow GRASS communication with graphical driver.<p>

a) You must have installed Cygwin for WINDOWS from
<a
href=http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/download.html>http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/download.html</a><br>
Get "Cygwin" package there (setup.exe).

Cygnus is required to run UNIX compliant applications on WINDOWS.<p>

b) Additionally get the XWindows precompiled client (Xfree) from
<a
href=http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/xfree/>http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/xfree/</a>.
Get the packages: DLLs, fonts, Xterm, Xwin, Prog.
(<a href=http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/xfree/docs/howto/book1.htm>Xfree install guide</a>)
<p>

c) Building IPC for Grass5:<br>
 You will need the Inter-process communication (IPC) code:
 <a href=http://www.neuro.gatech.edu/users/cwilson/cygutils/V1.1/cygipc/>
http://www.neuro.gatech.edu/users/cwilson/cygutils/V1.1/cygipc/</a>
These binaries are included in the grass5 zip file; however
you will need the .a archive to build on your own.
<br>
See <a href=http://freegis.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/~checkout~/grass/documents/compile_grass_with_wincygnus.txt>
See compile_grass_with_wincygnus.txt</a>
for more details.

<hr>

Installation of GRASS 5 Windows binaries:<br>
 It is a relative root path so someone can unzip it to
 their D: drive if necessary.   Depending upon where
 you have your cygwin installed, it could go under that
 root directory:

 - store GRASS 5 zip into the main directory of CygWin<br>
   (e.g. /programs/cygwin)<br>
 - unzip grass5-xxxxxxxxx.zip (replace xxx with current version number)
   using your favourite "unzip" software
 - change to: /programs/cygwin/usr/local/grass5/ and double click
   "StartGrass"
 
<p>
Starting Grass5:<br>
 The package includes a StartGrass script in the /usr/local/grass5.
 This sets the PATH, start the ipc daemon, and spawns an xterm
   window.  From within that window run 'grass5'. 

<HR>
Compiling the GRASS 5 locally - CVS Grass5:<br>
