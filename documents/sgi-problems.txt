***************************************************************************
Note for SGI IRIX:

You can get the GNU Tools and the GNU C compiler gcc in the IRIX tardist
ready-to-install format from:

  http://freeware.sgi.com

***************************************************************************

The newer GNU C compilers (gcc 2.8.1 and up) do no longer support the old 32
bit ABI (o32 option), so that you have to compile in the new n32 format. The
C compiler supports 64bit libraries and binaries on machines with 64bit
architecture (IRIX64), but the GRASS vector library format currently is not
interoperable between 32bit and 64bit. Please refer to the document
ALPHA/README.alpha64 for compiling on 64bit platforms.

You need to install the SGI back end tools (dev.sw.lib, etc.) from the
Development Foundation CD and the Development Library CD from the IRIX 6.5
distribution media set in order to use the GNU compiler gcc.

The actual distribution (GRASS 5.0.0) should compile without problems on
IRIX 6.5.x with the GNU compiler gcc and with the native IRIX compiler from
SGI (MIPS PRO compiler).

Compare the file REQUIREMENTS for the libraries that need to be installed
in order to link to.

The resulting binaries get very huge, because the linker flag -s to ld for
stripping the binaries does not work (you get a core dump). You can remove
the symbol table with the IRIX strip command like this:

cd /usr/local/grass5
find . -type f -perm 0755 -exec strip {} \;

This may require root permissions. strip will give you many warnings, but i
noticed no problems. All programs still work. Never use the -f flag to
strip. Do not strip the binaries if you want to debug the programs later.
