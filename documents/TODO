Here is a list of things we'd like to work on and
get in GRASS, but haven't had time.  If you'd like
to contribute a little time to the user community,
contact us about these projects and we will help
out as much as we can.

A.   Help with Windows 98 migration.  We've started
     this project but it would go faster if we could
     get some feedback/help.

B.   Add new projections.
     -> in progress

C.   Import/export modules for IDRISI, Intergraph,
     new DXF, and other common GIS formats.


These are the things left to do before the stable
GRASS 5.0 release is there.  This isn't done in
GRASS 5.0 beta, but should be in 5.0.

1.  Rewrite the manual pages directory structure.
    This is not a necessity, but would be neat
    and cool. (actually this will probably wait 
    until the next release, which will hopefully 
    use all html. 

2.  Clean up the src.contrib and src.related 
    directories.  (mostly done)

3.  Floating-point *should* be all done, however,
    some operations may still need to be identified
    and changes made.

4.  Clean up tcltkgrass a bit.  Make sure everything 
    is there that needs to be there.  Finish that 
    TclTkGRASS Manual.

5.  Maybe write a downward-compatability module so
    GRASS 4.x can use mapsets generated by 5.0.

6.  Clean up and update the database tools in the
    src.related directory.

7.  Vacation at a Sandals resort in the Carribbean.
