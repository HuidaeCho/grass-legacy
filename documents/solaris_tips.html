Corrections for Solaris 2.6 using gcc - compiler:

1. Problems with src.alpha/sites/s.geom-package?

 a) Edit src.alpha/sites/s.geom/libes/basic/basic.h:
   comment line 92 to 94:
   from:    #ifdef sun
              char *sprintf();
            #endif

   to :  /*#ifdef sun
          *    char *sprintf();
          * #endif */

 b) Edit src.alpha/sites/s.geom/libes/include/basic.h:
   comment line 92 to 94:
   from:    #ifdef sun
              char *sprintf();
            #endif

   to :  /*#ifdef sun
          *    char *sprintf();
          * #endif */

 Then you will be able to compile the s.geom module. The v.geom
 seems to cause more problems. Any ideas?

 To skip v.geom, change to
    src421/src/CMD/next_step/
 
 textedit the solaris file stored there and change
 from:
    src.alpha/sites/s.geom 
 to:
    src.alpha/sites/s.in.ascii.dem

 After that change to
   src421/src/CMD/
 and proceed with GISGEN.my.
