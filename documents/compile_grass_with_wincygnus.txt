This directory contains the experimental binary
version of GRASS under WINDOWS/Cygnus.

NOTE: The graphical output is not ported yet.
      -> no graphics yet, friends!!

---------------------------------------------------------

1. Get latest GRASS source code
http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/grass5/source/experimental/

2. To compile and link under the Windows NT/2000 go to
http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/download.html
and get the setup.exe.   Download it and run it.
It will prompt you for one of three choices, if you
have never loaded Cygwin software select download
from the internet.   If you have a previous version,
you should know what to do.  If you have never done this,
it will prompt you for a directory (partition) to
install the files.  I selected C: since I have space 
on my C: drive.  You can install it where you like.

Now, I fine tuned my mounts, here is my list:
Device              Directory           Type         Flags
c:\cygwin\bin       /bin                user         binmode
c:\cygwin\usr       /usr                user         binmode
C:\cygwin\bin       /usr/bin            user         binmode
C:\cygwin\lib       /usr/lib            user         binmode
c:                  /                   user         binmode

For instance, if yu installed it under C:\Cygwin
it will come mounted differently. Your / will 
start from the C:\Cygwin and not C:\   Umount it
and mount it (from CMD window) as you prefer.  e.g.

umount /bin
umount /usr/bin
umount /
mkdir c:\bin
mkdir c:\usr
mkdir c:\usr\bin
mkdir c:\usr\lib
mkdir c:\usr\local
mount -b C: /
mount -b c:\Cygwin\bin /bin
mount -b c:\Cygwin\usr /usr

The setup changes its configuration, so depending
upon your version 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3 your mileage
may vary.   If in doubt, try compiling a small program.

First though,

set MAKE_MODE=unix from the CMD (COMMAND for 98) window
before entering the sh or set it from the shell (sh,bash) 
line before starting to compile using Cygwin.

or

set it permanenetly in the start-settings-control panel
system-environmental tab.

Put C:\Cygwin\bin in your PATH.   I also have the
/usr/local/bin in my PATH.


3. Download the sunrpc tar.gz file from Corinna Vinschen
  site and install the binary files:
 ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/win32/develop/gnuwin32/cygwin/porters/Vinschen_Corinna/B20

Yes, the cygwin 1.1 of rpc is available under her B20 directory.  Get
the binary (not the src), go to the root (/) and use tar to unbundle
it.  e.g.

cd /
tar xzf /your/path/to/the/sunrpc-4.0.cygwin1.bin.tar.gz

4. Download the ncurses tar.gz file from Michael Hirmke's page:
ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/win32/develop/gnuwin32/cygwin/porters/Hirmke_Michael/

Install it, too.

5. Read about Unix running under Windows here:
    http://cygutils.netpedia.net/V1.1/index.html
    http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/docs.html

6. Get the unixODBC source, build and install it.
   Current version is 1.8.8 as of August, 2000

7. Add the values.h file to the /grass/src/include
   directory.  Put values in it for the following:

#define MININT      (1 << (INTBITS - 1))
#define MAXINT      (~MININT)
#define MAXDOUBLE   1.79769313486231470e+308
#define MINDOUBLE   4.94065645841246544e-324
#define BITSPERBYTE 8
#define BITS(type)  (BITSPERBYTE * (int)sizeof(type))
#define INTBITS     BITS(int)

8  Check the src/include/config.h file, if the #define CURSORS_MAXY
   is NONE, change this to _maxy and define
   #define HAVE_CURSORS in one of the lines
   previous to this line.   
 
9. You'll need to read the REQUIREMENTS files, download
   the public domain libraries, such as png, and build
   and install them.  You will need the pnm include and
   lib files.  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. To start GRASS compilation proceed like this:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

   If you have problems, go into the src/libes directory
   and build that first.  e.g.

   cd /grass/src/libes
   gmake5

11.  The current build was made using Cygwin 1.1.3
