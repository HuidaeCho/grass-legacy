This directory contains the experimental binary
version of GRASS under WINDOWS/Cygnus.

NOTE: The graphical output is not ported yet.
      -> no graphics yet, friends!!

Subject: updated grass5 instructions for Cygwin compile

1. Get latest GRASS source code
http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/grass5/source/experimental/

2. To compile and link under the Windows 98/NT go to
http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/download.html
and get the binary distribution full.exe.   Install
it.

3. Get a X-Server:

 Non-commercial: ******************************
 The previous free version of MI/X can be obtained from: 

    ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/current/dosutils/mix 

 This server is somewhat limited as it does not fully support the Athena
 widgets (menu items when selected become invisible!). 

 WeirdX is an X Window System server in pure Java under GNU GPL: 

    http://www.jcraft.com/weirdx/index.html 

 Currently, there is a group working on a port of XFree86 to cygwin. This
 will provide the community with a really free, open source, X server for
 win32. For project status and see how you could
 contribute please check: 

    http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/xfree/ 
    ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/cygwin/xfree/

 And finally:

    http://siddiqi.webjump.com/

 Choose one of above Xservers.

4. Get the precompiled X11R6.4 binaries for Cygwin from
  http://dao.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/grads/win32/X11R6.4/

5. Download the sunrpc tar.gz file from Corinna Vinschen
  site and install the binary files:
 ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/win32/develop/gnuwin32/cygwin/porters/Vinschen_Corinna/

6. Download the ncurses tar.gz file from Michael Hirmke's page:
ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/win32/develop/gnuwin32/cygwin/porters/Hirmke_Michael/

6.b Read on here:
    http://cygutils.netpedia.net/V1.1/index.html
    http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/docs.html

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. To start GRASS compilation proceed like this:

    Set the execute permission on the gmake5.0 script in the
    repository so that is is executable.
                                                                                                           
       chmod +x src/CMD/gmake5.0

    I made my life easy by creating a mount point for /grass
    so from the Windows CMD prompt do:
       
       mkdir c:\grass
       mount e:\cvs\grass5\grass /grass

       sh
       cd /grass
       GMAKE=/grass/src/CMD/gmake5.0
       GRASSSRC=/grass/src
       export GMAKE GRASSSRC

    The configure does not create the /usr/local/grass-5.0b directory.
    This must be created:
   
       mkdir /usr/local/grass-5.0b
       cd /grass
       ./configure

    Now we copy the ready-to-use "head" file:

       cd src/CMD/head
       cp os_specific/cygwin32 head
       cd -

    In the CMD/head/head file then include the following line 
    XDRLIB              = /usr/local/lib/librpclib.a

  Check the src/include/config.h file, if the #define CURSORS_MAXY
  is NONE, change this to _maxy and define
  #define HAVE_CURSORS in one of the lines
  previous to this line.   

  Modify the line in the src/CMD/head/head file
  and replace the word "yacc" with "bison -y".

  set MAKE_MODE=unix from the CMD (COMMAND for 98) window
  before entering the sh or set it from the shell (sh,bash) 
  line before starting to compile using Cygwin.


  And finally start compilation process:
    
       src/CMD/generic/GISGEN.sh > cygwin.er 2>&1    

  It should compile (more or less)...

  One other item to run the X under NT                                            
   set DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0.0

Comments are welcome!
