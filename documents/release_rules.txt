How to release GRASS 5 binaries

Note: This text contains some rules only applicable by Markus.

Generally the binaries shall be produced from a published
source code tarball:
http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/grass5/source/


0. Check & docs:

 o Check version string:
     src/CMD/VERSION

 o Markus:
   Check if no M/C CVS conflicts have been there before tagging.

 o Markus:
   Update the PDF-docs on server (needs "htmldoc" tool):
      ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/mirrors/ftp.easysw.com/pub/htmldoc/

     gmake5 html/ pdf-docs

   upload result from dist.$ARCH/documents/pdf to GRASS web server,
   remove here (makes binaries too big).


1. Build GRASS:
 
 o wipe out binaries, (re-)compile everything, incl NVIZ without PG:
     make distclean
     rm -rf /usr/local/grass5/*
     configure --enable-postgres=no
     make
     
 o compile G3D tools
     gmake5 src.contrib/GMSL/g3d

 o compile PostgreSQL modules:
     configure --enable-postgres=yes
     make pre-compile
     gmake5 src.garden/grass.postgresql

 o Markus:
   compile s.vol.rst from extra directory (if you have..., it is not 
   distributed with sources)

 o check, if libgdal is in place in $GISBASE/lib/
   Get Linux version here:
     ftp://gdal.velocet.ca/pub/outgoing/libgdal-linux-grass.tar.gz
    (Note: check ldd libgdal.1.1.so dependency, get if required:
     ftp://gdal.velocet.ca/pub/outgoing/libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3)
   Get GDAL sources at:
    http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/

 o Run again
    gmakelinks5
   or 
    gmakelinks5 |wc -l
   
   Should be > 400 modules.

 o Finally run
    make install


2. Package GRASS bins with

    make bindist

Pre-phase: pre-testing
