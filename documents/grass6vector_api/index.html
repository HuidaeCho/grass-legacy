This document describes the GRASS 6.0 Vector Data Applications Programming
Interface (API). This work was funded by the USDA Soil
Conservation Service and the US Army Construction Enginering Research
Laboratories.
<p>
The goal of this api is to be a complete high level object oriented
interface for accessing, creating, and modifying vector data. Previous
releases of the vector library were never designed from an end user point of
view but were a collection of functions which provided a
mechanism to access the data. This API has been completely redesigned from
the ground up and should solve most of the problems inherent
in the previous releases.
<p>
The API attempts to hide much of the complexity of working with vector data
and instead provides an interface to higher level objects. For
example, all file management is handled by the API and the client needs only
deal with map objects. The details of managing arc data are
hidden in an arc object, and modifications to maps are managed through
simple methods such as add and delete.

Note that the hierarchy of this document tree is very simple. The top is the
page <b>Vector API</b>. From that page there are a number of
    leaves which are single files organized by conceptual sub-groups within
the API. There is also a small number of leave pages
    which describe more general topics which aid in understanding the
sub-groups. There is also a link to the <b>dpg library</b> top page.
    That page is set up similar to the <b>Vector API</b> page, in that below it are
several leaf pages which represent the sub-groups of that
    library. Each sub-group page has an intro and then an index of each of
the functions in that group. Those functions then follow
    along with a short description.
