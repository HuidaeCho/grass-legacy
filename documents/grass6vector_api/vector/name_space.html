<h1>  
    GRASS 5.0 Vector API: Name Space
</h1>

The Vector API has the convention that every global name has a prefix
of the letters GV.  This includes any variation of upper and lower case
letters.  For example<p>
<ul>
    <li> #define's typically begin with <em>GV</em>.
    <li> functions begin with <em>gv</em>.
    <li> typedefs and structurs begin with <em>gv</em>.
    <li> global variables, what global variables?
</ul>

<h2> Gotcha's </h2>

    <h3> Function Names </h3>
	All global functions in this library and the <em>DPG</em> library
	which it references have one of these prefixes: 
	<ul>
	    <li> gv
	    <li> dpg
	    <li> tavl
	</ul>

    <h3> Global Variable Names </h3>
	There are <strong> no </strong> global variables in this library.<p>

    <h3> #defines </h3>

	There are a very few wild #defines left.  And each of these is tested
	to see if it already exists and is not over-ridden if so, which may 
	or may not be a good thing depending on what they are previously 
	declared as.  <p> 

	<dl>
	<dt> VOID
	    <dd>  This is used only for filling prototypes of functions which 
		do not take an argument.  This isn't even necessary as the 
		GV_ARGS macro removes this stuff anyway.
	<dt> SIGNED
	    <dd>  This is defined as <em>signed</em> if ANSI or nothing 
		otherwise.
	<dt> CONST
	    <dd>  This is defined as <em>const</em> if ANSI or nothing 
		otherwise.
	<dt> BEGIN_DECLS
	    <dd>  This is used to surround prototypes with 
	    <strong> extern "C" { } </strong> if <em>__cplusplus</em> 
	    is defined.
	<dt> BEGIN_DECLS
	    <dd>  The other end
	</dl>

	These of course could be converted to GV_, but I just got sick of
	prefixing everything. <p>
