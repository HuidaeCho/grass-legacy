<h1>  
    DPG Library
</h1>

This library was built in support of the GRASS 5.0 Vector API.
But it was designed to provide several useful reusable functions.  It
started out as a collection of independant libraries.  My concept
of a library is a re-usable module of independant code.  This, when
taken to an extreme (like I do with most things), can turn out to be 
a very small piece of code which does not deserve the title of library.
So I have gathered these all together placed them into a single library.
This is not unreasonable as many of the modules are built on top
of other modules.<p>

All names in the global name space begin with either the prefix <em>dpg</em>
or <em>tavl</em> in any combination of upper and lower case letters. DPG
are my initials and I couldn't come up with anything more creative than that.
Tavl is there because that is the prefix of a library for an 
AVL tree writen by <a href=../credits.html#tavl>Bert C. Hughes</a>. It was
so well designed and written almost in the same way I was designing my
libraries that I didn't want to desecrate it by changing its prefix.<p>

Here is an image the modules in the library and their dependancy relationships.

The modules available in the DPG libarary are:<p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href=ocache.html>	Object Cache				</a>
    <li> <a href=ostore.html>	Object Storage				</a>
    <li> <a href=string.html>	String management			</a>
    <li> <a href=age.html>	Age manager				</a>
    <li> <a href=debug.html>	Debug					</a>
    <li> <a href=bitmap.html>	Bitmap					</a>
    <li> <a href=darray.html>	Dynamic Array				</a>
    <li> <a href=dict.html>	Dictionary				</a>
    <li> <a href=linkm.html>	Linked List Memory Manager		</a>
    <li> <a href=linkmm.html>	Linked List Memory Manager Manager	</a>
    <li> <a href=itree.html>	Integer Tree Tavl Front end		</a>
    <li> <a href=tavl.txt>	TAVL Tree 				</a>
    <li> <a href=stdio.html>	Stdio					</a>
    <li> <a href=xdr.html>	Xdr Front end				</a>
    <li> <a href=malloc.html>	Malloc Front end			</a>
</ul>

Note I am not real proud of a few of these.  I was very rushed in
building this library and there are a few things that should be 
done differently.  Unlike the Vector API, this library did not have
a design document before coding began.  None the less, a few of them are quite 
powerful and have a lot of potential. <p>
