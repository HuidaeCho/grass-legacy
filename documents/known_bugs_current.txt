History at end of file.

----------- modules ---------------------------------------------
d.his: 
 - color wrong if input value=0
 - added NULL randomly when using "out" for saving

d.mon: hangs with "-L" option
   (would be nice to fix to improve "d.monsize" script

d.param.scale
 - lower axis description not readable
 - sometimes "floating point exeption", especially in par=geary

d.profile: the min/max printed at profile are wrong
           sometimes the entire profile wrong
           obviously problem with fp/int maps

d.rast.num: some numbers are displayed in wrong (unreadable) color

d.site.label: needs to be updated to new sites API

d.sites.label needs modified for the new Sites API

d.sites.qual: not all the sites are used/displayed
  d.sites.qual doesn't work properly: not all the sites 
  are used/displayed if the number of fields of the input site file is 
  not constant. Compare with d.sites.

i.ortho.photo
 - if second control point is set by mouse, it is not indicated
   immediately in orange color (right window)

i.rectify/i.rectify2
 - do not work properly

i.tape.tm.fast: (Todd Shoemaker, jtshoe@datasync.com)
bugreport: 
 * After entering the device name and selecting the bands to load,
 the dialog which asks for the Group is not visible.  The window goes 
 blank, but text can still be entered correctly, so it is merely an 
 annoyance rather than a showstopper.
* Attempting to change the default Title causes a segfault.

r.binfer
  bug in table.c causing segfault

r.contour: (reported by D D Gray <ddgray@armadce.demon.co.uk>)
 Though it is not a stability problem, I've found that if this module is
 run on an elev raster with an active old-style mask, i.e applied with
 r.mask, the contour lines which terminate on the mask boundary (but only
 these) are duplicated, as if reflected off the mask boundary. The
 resulting line is then closed giving a closed loop that is folded in on
 itself with a node at one end or in the middle of the line, and no node
 at the other. This is most clearly seen when viewed with v.digit. I have
 not seen a prior report of this problem though I have looked. My
 apologies if this has already been documented. Though I can't look into
 this myself at the moment, I have prepared a quick fix in the form of an
 awk post-processor which ´cleans' this problem, splitting the loop and
 removing the duplicate segment (it also removes ´degenerate' lines ie.  
 lines of one point which r.contour creates occasionally.) I have added  
 this as an extension, though I stress it is just a temporary fix.

r.drain
  fixed by Pierre de Mouveaux <pmx@audiovu.com>

r.in.hdf/r.out.hdf (src.garden/grass.hdf)
 - needs updating to HDF4.x lib (already there)

r.in.ppm
  seg. fault on Pentium CPU (compare r.binfer)
  Memory bug fixed by Alex Shevlakov

r.in.tiff/r.out.tiff
 - LZW code must be removed due to patent problems
 - segm. fault on Pentium CPU (same thing with r.binfer)

r.info
 - suggestion: raster type should be printed: CELL, FCELL, DCELL

r.los
 - segmentation fault in mark_pts.c line 37

src/raster/r.mapcalc/polish: (when compiling)
make[2]: Entering directory

r.null:
 does not work with reclassified maps

r.random
 needs to be updated to GRASS 5

r.reclass
 - segm. fault on Pentium CPU (same problem as r.binfer,...)
 - does not accept "*" to reclass NULL values

r.surf.contour broken
 segment_put_row write error Bad address
WARNING: cseg_read_cell(): unable to segment put row for [wegenetz] in

r.stats: some inconsistent results comparing to r.average
 *First, I compute the per-class averages:
     r.average base=medv cover=test out=borra.me
 *Second, I check the result for, i.e., class 23:
     d.what.rast map=medv,borra.me
     2676500(E) 4409500(N)
           medv in user1  (23)S_SUPRAMEDITERRANEAN_ZONE
           borra.me in user1, quant   (111)
           borra.me in user1, actual  (110.794075)
 *Third, I compute the statistics for each class, but the results are not
  the same as given by d.what.rast. For example, for class 23:
     r.stats -c in=medv,borra.me
     r.stats:  100%
       ...
       23 110.299171-110.744906 6082
       ...
 *While d.what.rast was giving 110.794075. Is this a bug?

r.timestamp
 - does not write time field properly

s.in.ascii: 
     - errors with more than 2 dimensions (some numbers are read as
            attribute)

s.to.rast, s.to.vect:
 should accept sites_list even if #cats field is missing and
 only a %dbls field is there (like the output from r.to.sites)

s.rand
 should write #cats rather than %cats (site numbering)

v.extract:
does not copy the category support for vector file

v.reclass:
The problem with v.reclass seems to stem from an input field for old=new        
reclass rule that cannot be more than 7 characters long (i.e. 11250=16 is       
eight characters long and will cause v.reclass to return an error). Someone     
needs to look at correcting this perhaps.

Further discussion:
--------------- lock file ---------------------------------------
Some lockfiles have to be global, just think of the number of
graphic display pipes used or physical inputs devices.
So two ways from there to improve the situation:
 
      Make the locking executables setgid or setuid.
      (and have just one executable doing the locking.)
      And/or use the /tmp directory.
 
      Localise all global lockable resources.
      (Unlikely to work.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Two severe problems (to be checked):

 - the mapdev/vector-modules need to be updated to new vector
   category support:
  Comment on vector cats from Bill Hughes:
  The Categories structure was changed between 4.x and 5.0beta.
  The change seems to have moved the *labels element out of the list
  structure and replace list.num with the index to **labels.  The fix
  is to change the SCS/* code to use 'cats->labels[i]' instead of
  'cats->list[i].labels'  There will be breakage around 'list[i].num'
  as well, and probably these can be deleted, or use 'cats->num' instead.

  Already sucessfully updated: v.random,v.extract,v.merge,v.autocorr
  updated src.contrib tree as well (10/99, Bill H.)

- src/libes/gis/set_windows.c
  There is a bug breaking a number of raster modules.
  This bug affects several commands including r.in.poly,r.digit,r.flow,
  r.bilinear, v.to.rast, ...

Jaro Hofierka on this:
  The bug is in ~src/libes/gis/set_window.c between lines 97-119.
  My quick fix was to remove these lines and re-compile gis lib and also
  all affected commands. Of course, it would be better to fix it in a more
  convenient way, however I have no time to figure out what is wrong there...
  
 ==> In GRASS 5 beta4h/4i this passage became commented as recommended by Jaro.
     The denoted modules are currently *working*! Will these comments cause
     any problems??


--------------------------------------------------------------------
src/libes/geom: optri  -> used by s.geom, v.geom
 I [Bill Hughes] have been working through some errors in 
src/libes/geom/optri and I have a tarball of the directory attached below.  
This is not done yet, but it needs some expertise from somebody who 
understands it.  Two references to grAllocate() have only 3 parameters.  
I don't understand what it does, so I can't really guess at what
should be passed as the final parameter.  I have put in 0 for the
moment to get the compile to work.

src/libes/geom/:
[from Brook] The powerof2 warnings are the result of an unfortunate 
collision of names (with different semantics) between NetBSD headers 
and Grass.  As long as the Grass headers are always included _after_ the 
system headers it is ok; it would be safer to rename it to something 
else within Grass, though.
 -> same warning on Linux/Intel
