Step by step procedure for our pre-testers:

For testing the source code
o Download and unpack new distribution in a new directory
o Run configure
o Run make
o Run make install
o Check if Grass runs (does "make check" work?) - maybe better to have
  this before "Run make install"
o Run make uninstall
o Run make distclean

For testing the binary distributions
o Download and unpack new distribution in a new directory
o Run grass5install.sh
o Check if Grass runs (maybe use testgrass.sh or some script created 
  from the testsuite directory)
o check if maps can be displayed properly
o Run grass5uninstall (new feature in CVS tree, not in beta 11)
