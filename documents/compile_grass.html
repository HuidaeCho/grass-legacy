Compiling GRASS 4.3 using a UNIX platform 
(Linux/Solaris/HP/...)                               (25. Oct. 1999)

This is a text which should show you how to compile 
this new GRASS 4.3 version on a UNIX platform.

So - now we start. First you have to get the 4.3 source code 
from internet (http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/). 
Store the package in a new directory and uncompress the package
like:

   mkdir /usr/local/grass42

        (store source code there)

   gunzip grass_src43.tar.gz
   tar xvf grass_src43.tar        # Take parameter "x"!!

If you succeed (it is really easy) you get a tree

../src43/src
../src43/src.alpha
../src43/src.contrib
etc.

The dots ../ are your path like /usr/local where you
have stored all the stuff.

First we have to adjust a few things:

0. create a new link (GRASS expects mknod in /etc):

 cd /etc
 ln -s /bin/mknod mknod

Otherwise the GISGEN-script will not work properly.

Then, if ".h"-files (header files) will not be found 
during compilation, do following:

 cd /usr/lib
 ln -s /usr/openwin/share/include/X11 X11

 cd /usr/include
 ln -s /usr/openwin/share/include/X11 X11

Then proceed with GRASS compilation:

GRASS compiling instructions are stored in a specific file.
You have to take one of the already stored files there (file
collection for several platforms) or you must create a new head
file, if your platform is missing there. The easiest way is to
edit an existing file for that purpose.

1. Check the compiler instructions file (called "head"-file)

   cd  grass43/src43/src/CMD/head/

   Look out for your platform there (solaris2.6 etc.). You may 
   change compiler, paths etc. in this file if required. Usually 
   you don't have to change anything here.


2. Go to /usr/local/bin
   create a new file
      gmake4.3
   there. This file is also stored in the 
   ../src43/ directory and can be copied from there.
   The contents are: (text between lines, including colon,
   change the SRC and CMD path to your installation)

------------------------------------------------------------
:
SRC=/usr/local/grass43/src43/src
CMD=/usr/local/grass43/src43/src/CMD
HEADER=xxxxxx
HASX=yes
HASMotif=no
. $CMD/generic/gmake.sh
------------------------------------------------------------


Change "xxxxxxx" to the file name of your head file:
Example:
  platform SUN Solaris2.6 -> head file: src/CMD/head/solaris2.6
                          -> gmake4.3 file: replace xxxxxxx with solaris2.6 
                                            (HEADER=solaris2.6)
  platform Linux          -> head file: src/CMD/head/linux
                          -> gmake4.3 file: replace xxxxxxx with linux
                                            (HEADER=linux)
 

3. If required, change the paths in
   grass43/src43/src/CMD/GISGEN.my
     and
   grass43/src43/src/CMD/MAKELINKS.my
   
   to point on the gmake4.3 script.

4. In the file src43/src/CMD/lists/GRASS the modules are specified 
   to be compiled and the modules which shall be ignored (commented out).
   Usually you do not have to change anything here.

5. Begin the process of compiling. Start the script GISGEN.my:

   cd src43/src/CMD/
     GISGEN.my

   
So - now you can relax and go for tea.


[after some time...]
 
The source code should be compiled without problems.
Otherwise read <a href=linux_tips.html>here</a> or <a
href=solaris_tips.html>here</a>.

If you are on Linux, the ps.map package needs to be recompiled:
Due to different compiler options, you have to compile the 
ps.map-package again (only required, if you will use it!) with an 
additional compiling flag:

 All the ps.map modules need to be compiled with the -fwritable-strings
 flag. Do the following:
  (a) Edit the src/CMD/head/linux header-file 
             + add -fwritable-strings at the end of COMPILE_FLAGS line
               COMPILE_FLAGS = -O -fwritable-strings
  (b) cd to src.alpha/ps.map
             + remove all OBJ.linux directories (search recursive)
  (c) run gmake4.3 again in src.alpha/ps.map


6. Now we proceed with standard GRASS installation.

Start the script
 src43/src/CMD/MAKELINKS.my

to create the links onto the binaries. It will run some
seconds to minutes depending on your machine's speed.

Then you have to create the start-script for GRASS. (You can
take the file stored in the ../src43/ directory):

Copy it to: /usr/local/bin

or create it there, if it does not exist:
 textedit grass4.3

with following contents (text between the lines incl. colon, 
change GISBASE path to your installation):

---------------------------------------------------------
:
GISBASE=/usr/local/grass43
export GISBASE
sh $GISBASE/etc/GIS.sh
---------------------------------------------------------

It must be executable:

  chmod ugo+x grass4.3


7. Then some files have to be created to control the digitizer
   and the graphical output windows (called "GRASS monitors"):

   cd ../grass43/etc/
   cp digcap.sampl digcap
   cp moncap.sample monitorcap

8. After that activate the monitors within the monitorcap file:

   textedit monitorcap
  
    Here you have to delete the # character for the
    drivers x0 - x6 and the CELL driver. The paths will be alright 
    (look for it).

9. Finally... create the lock-directory:

  cd ../grass43/locks
  mkdir <machine_name>
  chmod 1777 <machine_name>

e.g.
  mkdir apollo
  chmod 1777 apollo

Fid out the machine's name with
  uname -n


10. OPTIONAL:

  - How to install a digitizer:
        read instructions in 
         - src43/src/mapdev/INSTALL-digitizer.txt
         - documents/instructions/admin/digitizer.html

  - How to install the postscript drivers for printing (used by
    ps.select, ps.map):
        read instructions in
          src43/files_for_binary_installation/README
  
  - compile XGRASS with lesstif:
       read <a href=comp_xgrass.html>XGRASS instructions</A>

  - install extra modules (e.g. from untested section):
     Follow the instructions <a href=INSTALL_extra_modules.html>here</a>.

------------------------------------------------------
Yeah! Have fun. And write nice new modules for GRASS community. The
GRASS-world is waiting for your ideas...
