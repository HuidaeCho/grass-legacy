You need to compile v.out and make sure it is in your path.

Run monitor.tcl from w/in GRASS.

On our system xgbrowser takes a long time to start up.  - be patient if 
    this is the case.

I had to do a lot of hacking to get zoom in /out to make the resulting
displayed window reasonable.  This is one of the areas that should be improved.

Pan window extents are set from current GRASS region. 

Also panning is slow because it redraws the entire map.  This could
possibly be improved by using bitmaps to pan instead of redrawing 
everything.

I have looked at the canvas code, and it seems reasonable.  Nice code,
Nothing obviously slow about it. (except mallocs w/ over 1000 data points/line,
which I haven't hit yet)
