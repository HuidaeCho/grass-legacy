The interface will start GRASS itself!


This interface was developed by Bill Jackson of the 
Land Inventory and Monitoring Team and Keith Mitchell 
of the Threatened and Endangered Species Team in the 
Natural Resources Division. This interface is a base upon which more
specific applications can be built.

Installation:
 1. The script "usle.start" should be modified to reflect 
    the path to access the tcl libraries.

 2 Also, it will be necessary to change the environmental
   variables at the top of the tcl script "usle.tcl" to 
   reflect the location of your grass programs etc.

Start:

  usle.start
