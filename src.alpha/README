This "src.alpha" directory contains GRASS code which is intended to be
included in the "src" directory in a future release.   They should all:
  1.  Be organized in the same manner as the code in the "src" directory.
  2.  Be Compileable with "Gmake"
  3.  Contain MAN and HELP files in the man.help directory.

All programs here should be considered to be in ALPHA release.  That means
that they have been run by at least the original programmer.  The health of
the programs are not guaranteed.  Reports on the programs are highly
encouraged.

All users/programmers are invited to test these programs and
  1. Verify to CERL that they work
  2. Identify to CERL bugs
  3. Send repairs to CERL
