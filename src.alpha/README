The programs under this directory are in alpha testing.  Those that 
prove serviceable will become part of the "main" programs for the next
release.   Alpha programs need to be test compiled on numerous machines
and then user tested.  Bug reports are encouraged (see bug.report.sh)

Programs represented in the following directories are documented in the
GRASS 4.0 User's Manual.

You may attempt full compilation by running gmake4.0 in this directory, or may
do partial compiles by running gmake4.0 in sub-directories.
