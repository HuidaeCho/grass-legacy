Sorry for the long delay in replying and thank you for your interest in the posting.  I  
have essentially the same information about EROS, hopefully the price of digital  
data will come down considerably if the change occurs.

I am making general inquiries about landsat MSS  TM and shuttle SIR data,  when I  
have something of value in the form of a synopsis of the results of this quest I will  
post it or mail it to the respondents list.  I am also carrying on some conversations  
with a variety of sources about these image formats and archives of their data, if I  
learn anything interesting relevent to MSS or think you would like to have some  
conversation I will cc you in the dialogs.

Thanks again.
