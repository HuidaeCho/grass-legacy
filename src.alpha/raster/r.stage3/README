INFORMATION ON ABRFC PRODUCTS
-----------------------------

The Arkansas-Red river Basin Forecast Center (ABRFC) covers the entire state of
Oklahoma as well as parts of Kansas, Colorado, Arkansas, New Mexico, Texas
and Missouri. The ABRFC provides NetCDF files as well as GIF files of hourly 
precipitation on its gopher server: 

	gopherpc.abrfc.noaa.gov (192.133.17.165)

The NetCDF files are contained in the /pub/StageIII/NETCDF_files. The GIF files 
are contained in the /pub/StageIII/GIF_files.  Files in this directory are 
produced every hour (6am to 10 pm -- During non-flood season and 24hours during
flood) and are held for three consecutive days after its generation. The NetCDF
files are named after the ending ZULU hour of the data contained within. All 
NetCDF files have a ".nc" suffix to it and all GIF files have a ".GIF" suffix 
to it. These products are made available to public free of cost. Future
products will include a 24hr NetCDF file ending at 12Z each day.

FAQ ON StageIII data
--------------------

Q: What is Stage 3? 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A: A Stage III precipitation product is a mosaic of all the Stage II 
precipitation estimates within the RFC (River Forecast Center) area.  The Stage
III products are produced by merging radar precipitation estimates (Stage I)
with ground truth data provided by rain gages.  In the Arkansas-red River 
Forecast Center (ABRFC) this includes 15 88-D radars and approximantly 500 
rain gages.  

Q: Who produces stage 3 data?    
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A: The 13 RFC's within the United States will eventually produce Stage III 
products. As of 4-94 the ABRFC is the only RFC currently producing Stage III
products.  As more radars come on line other RFC's will begin producing this 
product as well.

Q: What are some of the limitations of this data? 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A: The 88-D radars have difficulty detecting precipitation when the rain drops
are very small or when the precipitation is in the form of snow.  Under these 
conditions precipitation estimates tend to be under estimated.  Large Hail 
within a storm causes the radar to over estimate precipitation amounts.


Q: For what regions is this product available? 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A: The Arkansas Red River Basin is the only area where Stage 3 products are
produced as of 4-94.

Q: At what resolution is this product available?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A: The grid cell size is approximately 4 km by 4 km. 


SOFTWARE MODULE TO CONVERT NetCDF FILES TO GRASS RASTER MAPS
------------------------------------------------------------

r.stage3 is an initial attempt to convert NetCDF files containing rainfall 
precipitation data into GRASS raster maps.  The NetCDF files containing the 
precipitation values in the units of 1/100 of mm can be obtained from ABRFC's
gopher server. r.stage3 program generates the GRASS raster map layers only
in the Lat/Lon coordinate system. UTM is not utilized because the Area being
refrenced is too large for a UTM zone. The region settings for the ABRFC's
coverage area is:
	______________________________________________________________
	projection: 3 (Latitude-Longitude)
	zone:       0
	north:      41:16:06N
	south:      32:48:28N
	east:       90:53:28W
	west:       107:08:03W
	______________________________________________________________

You may use the clark66 spheroid and use any resolution that may be suitable
as far as your other data requiorements are concerned. (I would start with say
esres= nsres = 0:00:30).

The r.stage3 module can be obtained from the ABRFC's gopher server. r.stage3 
can be run only within GRASS.  This version of r.stage3 will work only
on NetCDF files created after the 6th of April 1994.

COMPILING r.stage3 MODULE
-------------------------

You will need the NetCDF libraries created by the Unidata Program Center. The
NetCDF libraries can be obtained via anonymous ftp from unidata.ucar.edu under
pub/netcdf/netcdf.tar.Z. You will the need to compile the libraries. r.stage3
can be only run within GRASS. GRASS is a public domain GIS which can be obtained
from U. S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratories. The anonymous
ftp addresss for obtaining GRASS is moon.cecer.army.mil. r.stage3 needs both the
NetCDF libraries as well as the GRASS libraries. If you have all the libraries
then r.stage3 can be compiled simply by running "gmake" (For GRASS 4.1 it is
gmake4.1) in this directory.

RUNNING r.stage3 MODULE
-----------------------

r.stage3 has the following commandline syntax:

	_______________________________________________________________
	Usage:
	 	r.stage3 [-v] input=name [output=name]

	Flags:
	  	-v   Verbose

	Parameters:
		input   Name of the netcdf file to be converted
		output   Name of the resultant raster map
	_______________________________________________________________

In the above, if output parameter is not specified then a mapname with
the same name as that of the input parameter is created. The rainbow 
colortable is created for the resultant map. The resulting maps have a  
resolution of 0:02:59.

Few sample NetCDF files and the corresponding GIF files are provided
in the sample directory. The vector directory contains the vector boundary
output from the command v.out.ascii of the ABRFC basin.

To run r.stage3 on the sample files just go into the sample directory and type:

	_________________________________________________________________
	r.stage3 -v in=04059418.nc
	_________________________________________________________________

	This will create a raster map by the name 04059418.nc. Similarly r.stage3
	can be run on other sample files. You can use the corresponding GIF files
	to compare them. Since the GIF files is in a different projection system,
	There is some distortion in between the raster maps and the GIF file.
	However the values in the raster are properly georefrenced.
