.SH DESCRIPTION
.I r.fuz.map
generates a set of raster maps from a fuzzified raster layer. The user selects an 
input map which has been fuzzified by \fIr.fuz.set\fR. Three maps can be
generated : 1) mu map, the spatial distribution of the membership function values,
2) class map, the  spatial distribution of the membership function types, 3) intersection
map, the intersection areas of two or more membership functions.
.br
In addition, according the type of derived maps, the user can select
a specific fuzzy variable and/or a specific membership function.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
The program will be run non-interactively if the user specifies program arguments 
on the commande line. Alternately, the user can simply type \fIr.fuz.map\fR
on the command line, without program arguments. In this case, the user will be
prompted for flag settings and parameter values.
.LP
\fBFlags:\fR
.LP
.IP \fB-p\fR 4
Print content of fuzzy variable file, i.e. the membership function characteristics.
.IP \fB-z\fR 4
Zero data values are considered as valid data.
.IP \fB-i\fR 4
In the case of an intersection map, this flag retains
only the pixels whose attribute belongs to two or more fuzzy sets. In other words, 
it corresponds to areas where intersection between membership functions exists.
.LP
\fBParameters:\fR
.LP
.IP \fBinput\*=\fIname\fR 13
Name of an existing fuzzified raster map
.IP \fBvar\*=\fIname\fR 13
Name of a specific fuzzy variable. This variable is defined in the fuzzy variable
file which has been associated to the input raster map by \fIr.fuz.set\fR .If this parameter is not set
by the user, the default value is the first name in the list of the fuzzy variables.
.IP \fBset\*=\fIname\fR 13
Name of a specific fuzzy set (or membership function). This name is one of these 
defining the selected fuzzy variable. This option is valid only in the case the user selects 
a mu map and/or a class map.
.IP \fBmu\*=\fIname\fR 13
Output raster map of membership function values. The values are coded from 0 to 100 percent.
.br
For each pixel value in the input map, the program looks for the corresponding membership 
values of the selected fuzzy variable.
.br
If the user does not select a specific fuzzy set,
and if the pixel is found to belong to several fuzzy sets, the maximum membership value
is retained.
.br
No category file is created with mu raster map.
.IP \fBclass\*=\fIname\fR 13
Output raster map of membership functions. For each pixel value in the input map, \fIr.fuz.map\fR
looks for the fuzzy set it belongs to. The output values are integer numbers ranging from 1 to n,
where n is the total number of available fuzzy sets of the working fuzzy variable. 
The categories are the names of the membership functions as defined in fuzzy variable file.
.br
If the user selects a specific fuzzy set, only one function will be extracted.
.br
If the user does not select a specific fuzzy set, and if the pixel is found to belong to 
several fuzzy sets, the retained category will be the name of the greatest membership function.
.IP \fBh\*=\fIvalue\fR 13
Threshold value. This option is valid only for class map. The range value is [0,1],
and the default is set to 0.5
.br
This option allows the user to define a threshold under which the pixel value is
 supposed to be too uncertain. Only the fuzzy sets for which membership value is greater
or equal to h are retained.
.IP \fBinter\*=\fIname\fR 13
Output intersection raster map. According to the pixel value, the program
looks for the number of fuzzy sets it belongs to. The output value is an integer, starting from 1,
which is incremented each time a new intersection is found. The category file contains
the concatenation of the fuzzy set names such as as "name1+name2".
.br
With the -i option, the user only gets the intersection areas.
.LP
.SH NOTES
\fIr.fuz.map\fR works in the current geographic region with the current mask.
.br
When the user types "list" in the interactive form, \fIr.fuz.map\fR will only 
generate the fuzzified raster map list (see man of \fIr.fuz.set\fR for 
handling fuzzified raster maps).
.br
In the interactive form, if the user asks for an unknown fuzzy variable name
and/or unknown fuzzy set, a request is made at the end of the command
for selecting aq new one in the list of avalaible names.
