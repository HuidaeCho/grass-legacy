This directory contains the documentation for the r.le programs.  The
documentation consists of a Wordperfect 5.2 file (doc.wp) and six 
figures that are to be inserted in the Wordperfect file after it is printed.
The figures are in postscript format.  I had a little trouble this time
getting the figures into postscript format.  They came through via an
intermediary TIFF file and are rather crude as a result.  Perhaps next
time they can be converted so they are clearer.  I'm sorry the manual cannot
be made available in postscript format as well, but I do not have access
to software to convert from Wordperfect to postscript.  The manual cannot
be provided in ASCII because it contains equations. If you do not know about
the Wordperfect software or do not have access to Wordperfect, you
can obtain a hardcopy of the manual for $10.00 U.S. funds to cover
mailing and copying costs.  Send to:

P.S. I appreciate suggestions, no matter how minor, for improvement of the
documentation.
