r.in.sunrast - convert a sun rasterfile to a GRASS cell file

This program converts a  sun  rasterfile  (as  created  by  sun's
screendump utility) to a cell file in the current GRASS database.
The user is simply prompted for the name of the raster file to be
converted, and the name of the cell file to contain the resultant
image.

It is recommended that this program be used in an xy database (as
opposed to, for example, a UTM database) since the cell header is
created with nonsense coordinates (ie coordinates  designed  only
to specify the number of rows and columns in the image). Of course,
the user can adjust the cell header after import using r.support.

The user must, of course,  first  create  the  rasterfile  to  be
converted  either  by  running screendump (to capture a displayed
image) or by some other means (eg from  a  scanning  system  that
produces rasterfile format).
