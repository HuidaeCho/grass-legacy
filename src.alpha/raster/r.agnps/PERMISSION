We have the source code for this at Purdue, but I don't know why this
hasn't been contributed to GRASS.  If I can get permission to
distribute it (Srini?), I will clean it up and make it available on my
ftp site. It may require a FORTRAN compiler unless I can f2c-ize
it. I don't believe that there's any documentation/man pages.

Darrel,

I don't have any problem of releasing agnps interface with grass,
but make sure who ever uses the interfaces (both input and output)
should have to use the version of AGNPS that I used, since
the data format has been changed and few new parameters have been
included.

I am sure you can use f2c to convert the agnps source code.

THanks and can you let me know if you are able to contribute to the
GRASS community.

Thanks again.

Srini
