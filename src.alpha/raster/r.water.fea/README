r.water.fea - Finite element analysis program for hydrologic simulations.

OVERVIEW
r.water.fea is an interactive program that allows the user to simulate 
storm water runoff analysis using the finite element numerical technique.
Infiltration is calculated using the Green and Ampt formulation. r.water.fea
computes and draws hydrographs for every basin as well as at stream junctions
in an analysis area. It also draws animation maps at the basin level.
