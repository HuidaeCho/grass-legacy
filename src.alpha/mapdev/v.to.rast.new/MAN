.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIv.to.rast.new\fR transforms (binary) GRASS vector map layers into
GRASS raster map layer format.

.LP
\fBParameters:\fR
.IP \fBinput\*=\fIname\fR 18
Name of the binary vector map layer to be converted.
.IP \fBoutput\*=\fIname\fR 18
Name to be assigned to the raster map layer output.
.IP \fBrows\*=\fIvalue\fR 18
Number of rows of memory to use when converting to raster.
(Default is 512).
.SH NOTES
.I v.to.rast.new
is an upgraded version of
.I v.to.rast.
The user should read the manual entry for
.I v.to.rast
for details on the vector to raster conversion process.

This new version has the following features:

.IP (1)  5
It does not use a temproary file. Results go directly to the raster map.
It does this by making one or more passes thru the vector map,
rasterizing only a fixed number of rows (in memory, default 512),
writing these rows to the raster map, and then repeating for the
next set of rows, etc;

.IP (2)
The line drawing algorithm is better. The original version of v.to.rast
moved each line to the nearest grid-cell center before rasterizing.
This version more nearly reflects the actual path of the vector lines 
through the grid cells; and

.IP (3)
It works for lat/lon databases as well as planimetric databases.

.LP
This version was not included as part of the 4.0 release due to
timing.  It was developed and completed during the beta-test phase of
grass 4.0.  Since v.to.rast is an essential part of the system, it was
deemed prudent to let this module get testing for a while. If it
survives, it will be part of GRASS 4.1.
