s.delaunay - Program to create a vector delaunay triangulation from a sites 
	     file. Delaunay triangualtion is based on the `hull' software, by 
	     Ken Clarkson (clarkson@research.att.com). See the directory hull 
	     or more details.

----------

Modified to use the GRASS 4.2 sites API. Allows x,y,z,attribute format for 
sites files. This enables a single sites file to carry all necessary 
information for TIN construction.

Modified to allow VRML 1.0 output as indexed face set.

----------

Modified to allow vertical scaling of elevation values.
