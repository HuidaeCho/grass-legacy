.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIs.to.rast\fR creates a raster map representation of a site list in
your GRASS mapset.
(The program
actually is a non-interactive subset of the functionality of the \fIs.menu\fR program.) 
A site list is a list of eastings and northings
describing the location of some point feature.
It can also contain a category value and category label
for each site location.
.sp .25
Once created, the raster map created from the site list can be used 
with other raster map layers in further analyses.
Allowing the user to create a raster map layer of sites opens up the
full analysis capabilities for site data
that are available for raster map layers within GRASS.
.sp .25
The number of categories present in the new raster map layers
will depend on the format of your site list file (see \fIsites.format\fR).
A multi-valued (more than one category)
raster map layer representation of a site list can be created with
a site list in the format:
.in +2
.B "E|N|"
.I "#n label"
.in -2
where \fBE\fR is the Easting, \fBN\fR is the Northing, and \fI#n label\fR
is the description field.  The description field consists of a
pound sign # followed by the category value
\fIn\fR to be associated
with the site's cell location,
and the category label \fIlabel\fR
for \fIn\fR.
.sp .25
If the user does not include a description field starting with
.in +2
.I #n
.in -2
beside the Easting and Northing on \fIevery line\fR in
the sites list file,
a single-valued raster map layer will be created instead.
In the single-valued raster file,
each site will be represented as the category value 1.
Non-site cells will be coded as category value 0.
The creation of a single-valued map can be forced - see the \fI-s\fR flag
below.
.sp .25
Note that only sites within the current geographic region
will be considered.
However, if the size of the sites is more than one cell ( 3x3, 5x5, etc.)
and a site lies near an edge of the geographic region,
some of the cells for the site may fall outside the geographic region.
These cells will not appear in the raster map layer,
and the site will no longer be 3x3 or 5x5
but will be clipped to fit the geographic region.

.LP
\fBFlags:\fR
.IP \fB-q\fR 20
Run quietly. (The default is verbose mode).
.IP \fB-s\fR 20
Force the creation of a (0/1) raster map. Thus, even if the
site file contains properly formatted description fields
denoting category values, each site 
will be represented in the resulting raster map as the category 1; 
non-sites will be 0 (no data).
.br
.LP
\fBParameters:\fR
.IP "\fBinput\*=\fIname\fR" 20
Name of site list in the mapset to use as input.
.IP "\fBoutput\*=\fIname\fR" 20
Name of raster map to be created in user's mapset.
.IP "\fBsize\*=\fIvalue\fR" 20
This option can be used to set the number of cells to represent a site.
The minimum is one cell per site (e.g. the default value of 0).
The alternatives are squares (which can be visualized as "layers" of
cells) around the cell at the site, such as 3x3 (size=1), 5x5 (size=2), 
7x7 (size=3), etc.
.IP "\fBtitle\*=\fIname\fR" 20
Title to be used when creating the new raster map. If not specified,
the program will come up with a default title.
.SH NOTE
Be aware that duplicate sites or sites that exist close to each other
may not appear as separate values in the raster map that is created. In other
words, if more than one site is within the confines of one raster grid
cell, only the last site read from the list in the given cell will be
represented. If this is a potential problem, use the \fIs.menu\fR programs
to check for multiple occurances. Also note that if a \fIsize\fR parameter
of 1 or greater is used, the site areas created may have an overlapping
effect, with sites found toward the end of the site file ending up
"on top" of those they overlap.
