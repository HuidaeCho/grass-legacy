DESCRIPTION
     Gwatershed generates a set of maps indicating  the  location
     of  watershed basins, the information which helped to create
     the basins, and information  to  interface  with  ARMSED,  a
     stormwater  runoff and sedimentation yield model.  The input
     to the program is as follows:

     el   Grid cell map of elevation data.

     pi   Grid cell map of actual depressions  in  the  landscape
          which are large enough to slow and store surface runoff
          from a storm event.

     ov   Cell input map indicating the amount of  overland  flow
          that  each  cell will contribute to the watershed basin
          model.  If omitted, Gwatershed assumes a value  of  one
          for each cell.

     th   The minimum size of an individual  watershed  basin  in
          either  grid  cells  (default)  or  total overland flow
          amount (if the overland_flow_map is used).

     ac   The absolute value of each cell in this output  map  is
          the  amount  of  overland flow that traverses the cell.
          Negative numbers indicate  that  those  cells  possibly
          have surface runoff from outside of the current window.
          Thus, any cells with negative values cannot have  their
          surface  runoff  and  sedimentation  yields  calculated
          accurately.

     di   Cell output of surface  runoff  accumulation  with  the
          values  modified  to  provide  for  easy  display.  All
          negative accumulation values are changed to zero.   All
          positive values above 60 are given a value of 60.

     dr   Cell output map of the "aspect" for each cell based  on
          the  algorithm  in Gwatershed.  The range of values are
          from -8 to 8.  Multiplying the absolute  value  of  the
          drainage  pointer  by  60  will  give  the direction in

          degrees that the surface runoff will travel  from  that
          cell.   Negative values indicate that surface runoff is
          leaving the current window.

     ba   Cell output of watershed basins.  Each  basin  will  be
          given   a  unique  positive  even  integer.   0  values
          indicate that the cell is not part of a watershed basin
          at the size of the current window.

     se   Cell output of stream segments.  Values will correspond
          to the watershed basin values.

     ha   Cell output of watershed basins divided into  left  and
          right sides.  The right-hand side cell of the watershed
          basin  (looking  upstream)  are   given   even   values
          corresponding to the watershed_basin_map. The left-hand
          side cells of the watershed basin are given odd  values
          which   are   one   less   than   the   value   of  the
          watershed_basin_mpa.

     ar   ASCII file output that can be fed into the grass.armsed
          program  to  calculate  sedimentation  yields  and unit
          hydrographs.

OPTIONS
     -4   Makes the program allow only  horizontal  and  vertical
          movement  for the surface runoff.  This can be a useful
          option if the elevation data is fine enough to allow  a
          more  finite-element  approach  to hydrologic modeling.
          For normal  elevation  data  (30  meter  grid  cell  or
          coarser), allowing drainage flow to travel in all eight
          directions is probably the best move.

NOTES
     Gwatershed uses the least cost search algorithm to determine
     the  flow  of  water  over  the landscape.  The algorithm is
     similiar to using Gcost and Gdrain for every  grid  cell  on
     the map.

     The minimum size of drainage basins  is  only  relevant  for
     those  basins  that  have  no  basins draining into them.  A
     watershed basin  that  has  contributing  basins  should  be
     considered  to  have  an area that includes the area of it's
     sub-basins.

     Although Gwatershed does not require the user  to  have  the
     current window filled with elevation values (ie. no masks or
     incomplete data), the results look rather poor  when  zeroes
     are  included  in  the  data  (assuming that the user is not
     dealing with information near sea level).  If there is  zero
     data  along  the  edge of the current window, that edge will
     not be able to propogate negative accumulation data  to  the

     rest  of the map.  This might give the user a false sense of
     security about the quality  of  their  data.   If  there  is
     incomplete  data  in  the elevation map layer, reclass those
     zero values with a value greater than the highest elevation.
     This  way, the results will be more indicative of the actual
     hydrology.

     Gwatershed requires a basin threshold (th) to give watershed
     basin  (ba),  stream  segment  (se), or half watershed basin
     (ha) information.  Gwatershed requires half watershed  basin
     information   for  the  ARMSED  interface  file  (ar).   The
     grass.armsed   interface   needs   half   watershed    basin
     information  to  compile  the  necessary soils and landcover
     data.
