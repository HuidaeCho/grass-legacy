NAME
     Glut - specify a color look-up table for a map
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Glut mapname

DESCRIPTION
     Glut builds a color look-up table (LUT) for map mapname
     according to specifications read from standard input.  There
     are two ways to specify a map's LUT: by category value or by
     percentages.

     To specify a LUT by category value one must create a list to
     associate category values with colors.  The first line of
     such a specification must contain the single character "#"
     to  be valid.  The remaining lines in the list each contain
     four integers: a valid category value, a red value (0-255),
     a green value (0-255) and a blue value (0-255).  The list
     must be in ascending order by category value.  This method
     assigns a color to each category value in the list and
     interpolates color values for categories not listed.

     To specify a LUT by percentages one must create a list to
     associate different portions of the LUT with different
     colors.  The first line of such a specification must contain
     the single character "%" to be valid.  The remaining lines
     in the list each contain four integers: a percentage value
     (0-100), a red value (0-255), a greeen value (0-255) and a
     blue value (0-255).  This method assigns a color to each
     percentage value in the list and interpolates color values
     for percentage values not listed.

EXAMPLES
     (1)
     To specify colors for a three category map: assigning red to
     category 1, green to category 2 and blue to category 3.
     Start by using the vi editor to create the following
     specification file.  Save it with the name spec.file.

       #
       1 255   0   0
       2   0 255   0
       3   0   0 255

     The color table can then by assigned to map threecats by
     typing the following command at the GRASS-GRID> prompt:

     cat spec.file | Glut threecats

     (2)
     To assign a greyscale color ramp to the LUT of map elevation

     use the following specification file:

       %
       0     0   0   0
       100 255 255 255

     (3)
     To create a natural looking LUT for map elevation use the
     following specification file.  It will assign light green
     shades to the lower elevations (first 20% of the LUT), and
     then darker greens (next 15%) and light browns (next 15%)
     for middle elevations, and finally yellow for the highest
     peaks (last 10% of LUT).
       %
       0     0 230   0
       20    0 160   0
       35   50 130   0
       55  120 100  30
       75  120 130  40
       90  170 160  50
       100 255 255 100
