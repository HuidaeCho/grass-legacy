NAME
     Gtraj - Trajectory analysis tool
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gtraj t=terrain_map  e=easting_of_gun  n=northing_of_gun
     d=direction  s=spread w=weapon_name  h=weapon_height
     a=ammunition o=output_map

DESCRIPTION
     Gtraj generates a map showing cells that can be hit from a
     firing point by shells from a user-specified weapon. Cells
     are marked with integer values that represent the muzzle
     firing angles required to hit them.

     The input to the program is as follows:

     terrain_map
          Filename of a grid cell layer containing elevation
          data.

     easting_of_gun, northing_of_gun
          Coordinates identifying the desired location of the
          firing point.

     direction, spread
          The direction is the horizontal angle the gun is to be
          fired from the firing point which the trajectory
          analysis is to be performed.  The angle will be in the
          form of [NS]0-90[EW].  For example, S60E indicates the
          angle is 60 degrees East of True South.  The spread is
          the angle in degrees to each side of the direction
          angle which the trajectory analysis is to be performed.

     weapon
          Type of weapon used for firing.  A list of weapon types
          and their associated attributes are kept in the file
          "$GISBASE/weapon_data/weapons".

     height_weapon
          Height of the muzzle of the gun (in meters) above the
          firing point's elevation.

     ammunition
          Type of ammunition used.  A list of ammunitiion types
          and their associated attributes are kept in the file
          "$GISBASE/weapon_data/ammunition".

     output_map
          Filename of cell map that will show results of Gtraj.
          Values between -89 and 89 indicate the gun elevation
          angle in degrees needed to hit that cell.  The value of

          90 is the firing point of the gun.  The value -90 are
          those points unhittable by the gun.
