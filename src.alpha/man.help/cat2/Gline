NAME
     Gline - extract lines from cell file into digit file

SYNOPSIS
     Gline [-ab] cell_file digit_file

DESCRIPTION
     Gline scans the named cell_file, assumes that the non-zero
     cells represent lines of single-cell width (such as produced
     by Gthin, and extracts vectors which follow the lines.
     Gline is capable of producing both ASCII and binary digit
     files.

OPTIONS
     -a   create an ASCII digit file in the digit directory.  The
          file will have ".ascii" appended to the name given on
          the command line.


     -b   create the named binary digit file in the digit
          directory.

          The default is to produce a binary digit file only.  To
          produce no output, use "-" alone.

SEE ALSO

BUGS
     Gline may produce "extra" lines at some intersections.  If
     the input cell_file does not contain single-cell wide lines,
     the results will be nonsense.  Known to crash.
