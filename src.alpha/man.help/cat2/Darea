NAME
     Darea - To obtain area/perimeter information on vector
     polygons.
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Darea [-f]  vector-file-name  [color]

DESCRIPTION
     Darea is an interactive tool which allows the user, using
     the pointing device (mouse), to obtain area/perimeter
     information on vector polygons in the current graphics
     window.  The user must run Darea providing the vector-file-
     name as an argument.  There are also the optional arguments
     of fill and color. The fill option signifies whether or not
     to shade the polygon on the screen.  If the fill option is
     passed, the polygon will be filled with a color and a white
     boundary will outline the polygon.  The default is NO fill
     and then only the boundary of the polygon will be drawn on
     the screen.   If a color is passed then that will be the
     particular color used for either the boundary or shading of
     the polygon.  The default color is red for drawing the
     polygon.  If the number of points of the polygon exceeds 512
     then only a boundary will be drawn even though you specified
     the fill option.

     The Darea program will provide both perimeter and area
     calculations for area polygons only.  You must position the
     cross hairs inside of the polygon that you wish to obtain
     the area/perimeter calculations and then click either the
     right or left button on the mouse.  The calculations will be
     displayed on the text screen.  The polygon selected on the
     screen will either have the boundary drawn or the area
     shaded to the particular color you have chosen.  This will
     visibly verify which polygon you have chosen on the screen.
     To quit Darea just click the middle button on the mouse.

     The fill option may be passed as any one of the following
     values:
      -f -fill -F -Fill -FILL f fill F Fill FILL

     The vector-file-name must be an existing vector file located
     in one the mapsets that you have previously indicated in
     your mapset search list.  For the file name you have chosen,
     the Darea program will use the first file of this name it
     locates according to the order of mapsets you have
     previously specified in your mapset search list.  The vector
     file will be a binary file located in the directory digit.
     You may have to run support.vect prior to running Darea for
     the first time for a file, to ensure the topology
     information for that vector file in directory dig_plus is
     current for that file.

     The following is an example of the execution of Darea using
     the vector file fields in the spearfish data set.  The
     information below will be displayed on your text screen when
     executing this program:
