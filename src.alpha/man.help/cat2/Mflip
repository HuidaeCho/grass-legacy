NAME
     Mflip - Flips elevation data extracted from systems which
     retrieve by rows from south to north.
     (Map Development Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Mflip if=inputfile of=outputfile rows=# cols=# bpc=#

DESCRIPTION
     Mflip is similar to Mrot90, except that rather than rotating
     a raster file Mflip Mflip filps the contents of the raster
     files generated by extraction programs about the east-west
     axis. Flipping may be necessary to compensate for the
     orientation of the data. This program can be used in
     conjunction with the program Mimport.ll to convert this
     rotated data into GRASS raster form.

     Mflip requires five inputs to be entered by the user:

     if   the full pathname of an already-existing file
          containing the data to be flipped.

     of   The full pathname of the output file in which the
          flipped data is to be stored.

     rows The number of rows of data in the input file.

     cols The number of columns of data in the input file.

     bpc  The number of bytes per column in the input file.

EXAMPLE
     The following command:

     Mflip if=/tmp/foo.out of=/tmp/flip.out rows=301 cols=358
     bpc=2

     will flip the file /tmp/foo.out, and place the flipped file
     in /tmp/flip.out. Here, the input file is 301 rows by 358
     columns, at 2 bytes per data value.
