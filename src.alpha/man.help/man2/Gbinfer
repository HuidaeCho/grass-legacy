[\fI-v\fR] \fIinput_script\fR \fI[output_cell_file]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gbinfer
is an expert system shell having an inference engine based on
Bayesian statistics (reasoning from past experience).  It
is designed for use by knowledge engineers to develop expert
systems for land use planning and management.  Knowledge about
the probable impact of a land use action is reflected in conditional
probabilities about the impact of similar past actions.
.sp
Consistent with the syntax of \fIGbinfer\fR, the knowledge engineer
structures an input knowledge/control script with an appropriate
combination of layer attributes (GRASS maps such as soil.texture,
slope, density, etc.) and context attributes (e.g. rainfall, temperature,
season, subjective judgement, etc.).  Options exist for specifying
a user interface and a database containing prior and 
conditional probabilities necessary to infer
the value of a goal attribute.  The knowledge engineer
also specifies the format for display of end results (map layers) in
the input script.
New map layers--one for each possible inferred
attribute value--are created that contain
the probability of the inferred attribute value occurring in each grid cell.
Alternately, a single new map layer called
\fIGbinfer\fR (or \fIoutput_cell_file\fR, if specified) 
is also created as output.
This map shows, for each grid cell, the inferred attribute
value that has
the highest probability of occurring in each grid cell, given the values
of the layer and contextual attributes.
.sp
\fIGbinfer\fR scripts are typed into
a file by the user using a system editor such as vi, and then input to
\fIGbinfer\fR as the \fIinput_script\fR named on the command line.
For a complete description of the \fIinput_script\fR syntax, see the document
\fRGRASS Tutorial: Gbinfer (forthcoming)\fR.
For example scripts see the FILES section below.
The results are used to generate the new map layers in the current mapset.
The option \fI-v(erbose)\fR is described in the OPTIONS section below.
.sp
As stated above, \fIGbinfer\fR scripts contain descriptions of two types of
input attributes. The layer type attributes are actual grass cell files, with
the values defined to be ranges of the categories within that cell file. 
For example, if the user chooses slope as one of the layer attributes 
the possible values for the slope attribute might be the following:
.sp
.TS
center;
l c.
flat	(slopes between 0 and 5 degrees) 
low	(slopes between 6 and 10 degrees)
medium	(slopes between 11 and 30 degrees)
steep	(slopes greater than 31 degrees)
.TE
.sp
The contextual attributes are those that do not represent cell layers,
but rather, information that reflects the context of the decision
at hand.
For example, if the user chooses rainfall amount as one of the contextual
attributes the possible values for the rainfall amount attribute 
might be the following:
.sp
.TS
center;
l c.
low	(rainfall amounts less than an inch)
medium	(amounts between one and three inches)
high	(amounts grater than three inches)
.TE
.sp
The inferred attribute values are specified along with a prior probability and a
table of conditional probabilities which indicate the probability of that 
inferred attribute value occurring given that an input attribute value has 
occurred.
.sp
\fIGbinfer\fR will determine the value of contextual attributes by prompting 
the user for input. It will then open the cell files corresponding to each 
layer attribute. \fIGbinfer\fR then determines the values for all layer 
attributes in each grid cell.  Using the conditional probability tables,
the prior probabilities, and Bayes theorem, \fIGbinfer\fR calculates the
output probabilities for each inferred value and writes its probability of
occurance
as a percentage.  It also determines which value is most 
likely to occur in that cell
and writes that to the \fIoutput_cell_file\fR.
