.TH Mflip 2M
.SH NAME
Mflip \- Flips elevation data extracted from systems
which retrieve by rows from south to north.
.br
(Map Development Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
Mflip if=inputfile of=outputfile rows=# cols=# bpc=#
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Mflip
is similar to Mrot90, except that rather than rotating
a raster file
.B Mflip
'flips' it north to south.
.B Mflip
filps the contents of the raster files generated by
extraction programs about the east-west axis. Flipping may be
necessary to compensate for the orientation of the data. 
This program can be used in conjunction with the program
Mimport.ll to convert this rotated data into GRASS
raster form.

.B Mflip
requires five inputs to be entered by the user:
.IP \fBif\fR
the full pathname of an already-existing file
containing the data to be flipped. 
.IP \fBof\fR
The full pathname of the output file in which the
flipped data is to be stored.
.IP \fBrows\fR
The number of rows of data in the input file.
.IP \fBcols\fR
The number of columns of data in the input file.
.IP \fBbpc\fR
The number of bytes per column in the input file.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following command:

Mflip if=/tmp/foo.out of=/tmp/flip.out rows=301 cols=358 bpc=2

will flip the file /tmp/foo.out, and place the flipped
file in /tmp/flip.out. Here, the input file is 301 rows by
358 columns, at 2 bytes per data value.
