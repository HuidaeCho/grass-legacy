.SH NAME
Gtraj \- Trajectory analysis tool
.br
.I "(G Language Tool)"
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBGtraj\fR t\*=terrain_map  e\*=easting_of_gun  n\*=northing_of_gun  d\*=direction  s\*=spread w\*=weapon_name  h\*=weapon_height  a\*=ammunition o\*=output_map
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIGtraj\fR generates a map showing cells that can be hit from a firing point
by shells from a user-specified weapon. Cells are marked with integer
values that represent the muzzle firing angles required to hit them.

The input to the program is as follows:
.IP \fIterrain_map\fR
Filename of a grid cell layer containing elevation data.
.IP "\fIeasting_of_gun, northing_of_gun\fR"
Coordinates identifying the desired location of the firing point.
.IP "\fIdirection, spread\fR"
The direction is the horizontal angle the gun is to be fired from the firing
point which the trajectory analysis is to be performed.  The angle will be in the 
form of [NS]0-90[EW].  For example, S60E indicates the angle is 60 degrees
East of True South.  The spread is the angle in degrees to each side of the
direction angle which the trajectory analysis is to be performed.
.IP \fIweapon\fR 
Type of weapon used for firing.  A list of weapon types and their
associated attributes are kept in the file "$GISBASE/weapon_data/weapons".
.IP \fIheight_weapon\fR 
Height of the muzzle of the gun (in meters) above the firing point's elevation.
.IP \fIammunition\fR
Type of ammunition used.
A list of ammunitiion types and their associated attributes are kept in
the file "$GISBASE/weapon_data/ammunition".
.IP \fIoutput_map\fR
Filename of cell map that will show results of Gtraj. Values between -89 and 89
indicate the gun elevation angle in degrees needed to hit that cell.  The value
of 90 is the firing point of the gun.  The value -90 are those points 
unhittable by the gun.
