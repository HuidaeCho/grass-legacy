.I (D Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Darea
[-f]  vector-file-name  [color]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Darea
is an interactive tool which allows the user, using the pointing device
(mouse), to obtain area/perimeter information on vector polygons in the current
graphics window.
The user must run
.I Darea
providing the 
.B vector-file-name
as an argument.  There
are also the optional arguments of 
.B fill
and 
.B color.
The 
.B fill
option signifies whether or not to shade the polygon on the screen.  If the 
.B fill
option is passed, the polygon will be filled with a color and a white boundary
will outline the polygon.  The default is 
.B NO fill
and then only the boundary
of the polygon will be drawn on the screen.   If a 
.B color
is passed then that
will be the particular color used for either the boundary or shading of the 
polygon.  The default color is red for drawing the polygon.  If the number of
points of the polygon exceeds 512 then only a boundary will be drawn even 
though you specified the 
.B fill
option.

The 
.I Darea
program will provide both perimeter and area calculations for
area polygons only.  You must position the cross hairs inside of the polygon
that you wish to obtain the area/perimeter calculations and then 
.B click
either the right or left button on the mouse.  The calculations will be 
displayed on the 
.B text
screen.  The polygon selected on the screen will either
have the boundary drawn or the area shaded to the particular color you have
chosen.  This will visibly verify which polygon you have chosen on the screen.
To quit 
.I Darea
just click the middle button on the mouse. 

The 
.B fill
option may be passed as any one of the following values:
 -f -fill -F -Fill -FILL f fill F Fill FILL

The 
.B vector-file-name
must be an existing vector file located in one the
mapsets that you have previously indicated in your mapset search list.
For the file name you have chosen, the 
.I Darea
program will use the first file
of this name it locates according to the order of mapsets you have previously
specified in your mapset search list.  The vector file will be a binary file
located in the directory 
.B digit.
You may have to run 
.B support.vect
prior to 
running 
.I Darea
for the first time for a file, to ensure the topology 
information for that vector file in directory 
.B dig_plus
is current for that file.

The 
.B color
value must be one of the following values:
white black yellow blue red green orange grey magenta aqua indigo violet brown

The following is an example of the execution of 
.I Darea
using the vector file 
.B fields
in the 
.B spearfish
data set.  The information below will be displayed
on your 
.B text
screen when executing this program:
