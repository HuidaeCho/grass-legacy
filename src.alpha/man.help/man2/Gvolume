.TH Gvolume 2G
.SH NAME
Gvolume \- Sums cell values within clumps and calculates
volumes and centroids of patches or clumps.
.SH SYNOPSIS
Gvolume d=data_map c=clump_map [s=site_list]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gvolume
generates a report which is a table containing the sum of all cells from a
.B data_map
layer sorted by category on a
.B clump_map,
and optionally
generates a
.B site list
of the centroids for each clump.
The sum is multiplied by the area of a cell to give the volume
occupied by that cell.  See below for an example of the output
report.

.I Gvolume
works in the current window and respects the current MASK.

.SH EXAMPLE OF REPORT
The following report was generated by the command:
(spearfish data base; fields.only is fields layer without the
National Forest category)

Gvolume d=elevation c=fields.only s=field.centers 

Gvolume report on data from elevation using clumps on fields.only map

.FI

The Data Total column is the sum of the elevations for each
in each of the fields.  The Total Volume is the sum multiplied
by the e-w resolution times the n-s resolution.  Note that
the units on the volume may be difficult if the units of cell
values on the data_map layer and the resolution units differ.

.SH CENTROIDS 
The centroid coordinates are the same as those stored in the sites
file (if one was requested).  They are guaranteed to fall on a cell
of the appropriate category, thus they are not always the true,
mathematical centroid.  They will always fall at a cell center.

.SH FORMAT OF SITE LIST
For each line of above table the site list reads:
.br
easting|northing|#cat v=volume a=average t=sum n=count

This can be converted directly to a cell file with each point
a separate category.

.SH APPLICATIONS
By preprocessing the elevation layer with Gmapcalc and using
suitable masking or clump maps, very interesting applications can
be done with Gvolume.  Such as, calculating the volume of rock
in a potential quarry; calculating cut/fill volumes for roads;
finding water volumes in potential reservoirs.  Data layers of
other measures of real values

.SH NOTES
The output is sent to the terminal screen. The user can capture
the output in a file as follows:

.RS
Gvolume d=data_map c=clump_map [s=site_list] > \fIfile\fB
.RE

or send the output directly to the printer:

.RS
Gvolume d=data_map c=clump_map [s=site_list] | lpr
