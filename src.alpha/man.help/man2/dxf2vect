.SH NAME
dxf2vect \- DXF format to GRASS vector format conversion program
.br
.I (G Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP "\fBdxf2vect\fR \fIdxf_filename output_directory\fR"
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIdxf2vect\fR generates a set of ascii dig maps, one for each DXF layer in
the dig directory.  \fIdxf2vect\fR will only recognize points, lines,
and polylines in the DXF format, and will translate these to the GRASS
vector format;  other types of data are ignored.
The input to the program is as follows:
.IP \fIdxf_filename\fR
The name of the DXF file, including its full pathname.
.IP \fIoutput_directory\fR
This is the name of the directory in which \fIdxf2vect\fR will place
the output files it creates.  An output file in ascii dig format will
be created for each unique DXF "map layer" (aka "level") present
in the DXF file.
The name of each output file will be the same as that of the DXF
"map layer" from which it was created.
.SH NOTES
\fIdxf2vect\fR only converts DXF files to the GRASS vector format.
\fIdxf2vect\fR does not contain any of the quality control functions
available in \fIdigit\fR that will prevent improper data from getting
into GRASS.
Also, this program does not create new labels nor other means to
identify the points or lines that occur in the DXF file,
except for those entities present in the original DXF file.
If present, entities are placed in output file(s) corresponding to the
levels (layers) on which they occurred in the DXF input file.
The resulting data in
vector format will probably have to be massaged in \fIdigit\fR to make it
useful for something other than graphic display.
.LP
\fIdxf2vect\fR does not truncate map layer names to the maximum file name
size of the operating system in use.
