.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "Dsplit"
mapname1 mapname2 [cmd=GRASS command] [view=horiz]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dsplit
is a UNIX Bourne shell macro which
clears the entire screen and divides it into two windows.
Maps are then displayed in each of the two windows.
This command is very useful for visually comparing maps
(cell, vector, 3D views) and can be used by other GRASS shell macros.
It is also useful for creating demos.
.SH Options:
.IP \fIcmd=\fR 12
The default command that displays the map is \fIDcell\fR, but it can be changed
to any GRASS command \fI(D3d, Dvect, etc...)\fR.
.IP \fIview=horiz\fR 12
The screen can be split either horizontally or vertically.
The default view splits the screen into two screens, one on the left
and one on the right (vertical split).  Some maps ( 3D views) are better
represented with more width then height (horizontal split).  The first map
name listed on the command line will be displayed in the top or left window,
depending on whether the screen was split, horizontally or vertically.
The second map will be displayed in the bottom or right window.
