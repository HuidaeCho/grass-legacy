NAME
     Dsplit - Divides the monitor into two windows and then
     displays two maps
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dsplit mapname1 mapname2 [cmd=GRASS command] [view=horiz]

DESCRIPTION
     Dsplit is a UNIX Bourne shell macro which clears the entire
     screen and divides it into two windows.  Maps are then
     displayed in each of the two windows.  This command is very
     useful for visually comparing maps (cell, vector, 3D views)
     and can be used by other GRASS shell macros.  It is also
     useful for creating demos.

Options:
     cmd=        The default command that displays the map is
                 Dcell, but it can be changed to any GRASS
                 command (D3d, Dvect, etc...).

     view=horiz  The screen can be split either horizontally or
                 vertically.  The default view splits the screen
                 into two screens, one on the left and one on the
                 right (vertical split).  Some maps ( 3D views)
                 are better represented with more width then
                 height (horizontal split).  The first map name
                 listed on the command line will be displayed in
                 the top or left window, depending on whether the
                 screen was split, horizontally or vertically.
                 The second map will be displayed in the bottom
                 or right window.

                 Example: Dsplit soils vegcover

                 Example: Dsplit elevation vegcover cmd=D3d
                 view=horiz

Comments
          Dsplit leaves the window that the last map was drawn in
          as the active window.
