The files in this directory (avalanche.binfer and bugs.binfer) are 
two somewhat accurate examples. 
The author makes NO claims as to the theoretical accuracy of these scripts.
  

                    Some Notes on Script Construction.


1. No Data ( or what to do with category zero).

   If category zero is excluded from the ranges of any layer
   attribute value, it is treated as "no data" and the
   resulting probability and combined maps will reflect this.

   Otherwise, category zero is treated just like any other cell value.

2. Category ranges for layer attributes.

   The category ranges are specified using Greclass rules.
   For example, a value list for slope might look like this:

     (flat [0 1 thru 3], gentle [4 thru 8], moderate [9 thru 15], 
      other [16 thru 89]).

3. Question Attachments.

   Question attachments can be supplied for and context attribute or
   attribute value. If names are chosen cleverly, the default menu
   should be sufficient.

4. Determinant List.

   At this time the determinant list serves no real purpose.
   Planned extensions to binfer will make use of this list, 
   so just don't use it for now.

5. Probabilities.
 
   The conditional probability table is very important, try to
   be sure of its accuracy.
