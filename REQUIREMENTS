REQUIREMENTS to compile GRASS GIS

A workstation running some flavor of unix like Solaris,
Irix, Linux or MacOS.  Ideally, you should have at least 500
Mb for data and 32 Mb RAM. The source code package needs
around 100MB uncompressed. The resulting binaries may need
between 60MB and 160MB depending on your platform.

General requirements:
(most tools are standard tools on Linux, for other platforms you
 may have to install some of them.)

 - C-compiler (cc, gcc, egcs, ...)
    gcc: http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html

 - Fortran compiler (f77, g77, ...) for a few modules
    g77: coming along with gcc

 - lexical analyzer generator (flex), 
   (lex is no longer supported, please use flex instead)
    flex: http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/flex.html

 - parser generator (yacc, bison)
    bison: http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html

 - libncurses4.x/5.x
     http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html
     ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/

 - X11 window system for graphical output, development libraries
   (X development libraries, in some linux distributions 
    they are separate packages)
     http://www.xfree.org
 
Optional requirements:

 - Tcl/Tk 8.x libraries to use TclTkGRASS Interface
      and to compile src.contrib/GMSL/NVIZ2.2/
      see [http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/main_tclgrass.html]
 - Mesa-3.x (openGL clone) required for NVIZ2.2
     [http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net/]
     Compile instructions:
     [http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/grass5/related/README.mesa3d]
 - libpng (for r.in.png, r.out.png), usually already installed.
     [ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/png/]
 - libz (compression library, for some modules), usually already installed.
     [ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib]
 - libjpeg (for r.in.tiff, r.out.tiff, for HDF library), 
   usually already installed.
     [ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/]
 - libtiff (for r.in.tiff, r.out.tiff), usually already installed. 
     [http://www.libtiff.org]
     
 - libg2c (for r.fill.dir, or use g77)
     [http://?]
     
 - postgreSQL libraries (for the postgres database interface)
     [http://www.postgresql.org]

 - Unix ODBC (for the ODBC database interface)
     [http://www.unixodbc.org]

 - R language (for the R language interface)
     [http://cran.r-project.org]
     
 - usually not required (as you will use NVIZ):
     Motif or Lesstif libraries required for 
          src.contrib/GMSL/ogl3d
     [http://www.lesstif.org]
