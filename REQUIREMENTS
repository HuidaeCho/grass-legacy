REQUIREMENTS to compile GRASS GIS

A workstation running some flavor of unix like Solaris,
Irix, or Linux.  Ideally, you should have at least 500
Mb for data and 32 Mb RAM. The source code package needs
around 100MB uncompressed.

General requirements:

 - C-compiler (cc, gcc, ...)
 - Fortran compiler (f77, g77, ...) for a few modules
 - lexical analyzer generator (lex, flex)
 - parser generator (yacc)

Special requirements

 - Tcl/Tk 8.x libraries to use TclTkGRASS Interface
      and to compile src.contrib/GMSL/NVIZ2.2/
     [http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/main_tclgrass.html]
 - Mesa-3.x (openGL clone) required for NVIZ2.2
     [http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net/]
     Compile instructions:

 - libncurses4.x/5.x
     [ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/]

 - usually unrequired (NVIZ is based on former ogl3d):
   Mesa-3.x and lesstif required for 
          src.contrib/GMSL/ogl3d
     [http://www.lesstif.org]
