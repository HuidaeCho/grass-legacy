 - C-compiler (cc, gcc, ...)
 - Fortran compiler (f77, g77, ...) for a few modules
 - lexical analyzer generator (lex, flex)
 - parser generator (yacc)

Special requirements

 - Tcl/Tk 8.x libraries to use TclTkGRASS Interface
      and to compile src.contrib/GMSL/NVIZ2.2/
 - Mesa-3.0 (openGL clone) required for NVIZ2.2
 - Mesa-3.0 and lesstif required for 
          src.contrib/GMSL/ogl3d
