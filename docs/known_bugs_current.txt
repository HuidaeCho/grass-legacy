 Revision 1.0  2000/01/10 19:14:53  markus

----------- modules ---------------------------------------------
d.mon: hangs with "-L" option
   (would be nice to fix to improve "d.monsize" script

d.profile: the min/max printed at profile are wrong
           sometimes the entire profile wrong
           obviously problem with fp/int maps

d.site.label: needs to be updated to new sites API

d.sites.label needs modified for the new Sites API

d.sites.qual: not all the sites are used/displayed
  d.sites.qual doesn't work properly: not all the sites 
  are used/displayed if the number of fields of the input site file is 
  not constant. Compare with d.sites.

i.ortho.photo
 - if second control point is set by mouse, it is not indicated
   immediately in orange color (right window)

i.rectify/i.rectify2
 - do not work properly

r.binfer
 segm. fault on Pentium CPU (same thing with r.in.tiff)

r.coin
  fixed. Please check if working properly.

r.cost
 segment_put_row write error Bad address (same problem with r.surf.contour)
 
r.drain - segm. fault

r.in.hdf/r.out.hdf (src.garden/grass.hdf)
 - needs updating to HDF4.x lib (already there)

r.in.ppm
  seg. fault on Pentium CPU (compare r.binfer)

r.in.tiff/r.out.tiff
 - LZW code must be removed due to patent problems
 - segm. fault on Pentium CPU (same thing with r.binfer)

r.in.png/r.out.png
 - should be developed from existing code (part of module already there)

r.info
 - suggestion: raster type should be printed: CELL, FCELL, DCELL

src/raster/r.mapcalc/polish: (when compiling)
make[2]: Entering directory
/home/neteler/src5/grass5.0beta/src/raster/r.mapcalc/polish'
rm -f lex.yy.c y.tab.c

mv main.o OBJ.i586-linux-elf/main.o
flex pol.l
yacc pol.y
yacc: 14 shift/reduce conflicts, 17 reduce/reduce conflicts.

r.random
 needs to be updated to GRASS 5

r.reclass
 - segm. fault on Pentium CPU (same problem as r.binfer,...)

r.surf.contour seems to be broken
 segment_put_row write error Bad address
 (same problem with r.cost)

r.stats: some inconsistent results comparing to r.average
 *First, I compute the per-class averages:
     r.average base=medv cover=test out=borra.me
 *Second, I check the result for, i.e., class 23:
     d.what.rast map=medv,borra.me
     2676500(E) 4409500(N)
           medv in user1  (23)S_SUPRAMEDITERRANEAN_ZONE
           borra.me in user1, quant   (111)
           borra.me in user1, actual  (110.794075)
 *Third, I compute the statistics for each class, but the results are not
  the same as given by d.what.rast. For example, for class 23:
     r.stats -c in=medv,borra.me
     r.stats:  100%
       ...
       23 110.299171-110.744906 6082
       ...
 *While d.what.rast was giving 110.794075. Is this a bug?

r.timestamp
 - does not write time field properly

s.in.ascii: 
     - errors with more than 2 dimensions (some numbers are read as
            attribute)

s.to.rast, s.to.vect:
 should accept sites_list even if #cats field is missing and
 only a %dbls field is there (like the output from r.to.sites)

s.rand
 should write #cats rather than %cats (site numbering)

Further discussion:
--------------- lock file ---------------------------------------
Some lockfiles have to be global, just think of the number of
graphic display pipes used or physical inputs devices.
So two ways from there to improve the situation:
 
      Make the locking executables setgid or setuid.
      (and have just one executable doing the locking.)
      And/or use the /tmp directory.
 
      Localise all global lockable resources.
      (Unlikely to work.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Two severe problems (to be checked):

 - the mapdev/vector-modules need to be updated to new vector
   category support:
  Comment on vector cats from Bill Hughes:
  The Categories structure was changed between 4.x and 5.0beta.
  The change seems to have moved the *labels element out of the list
  structure and replace list.num with the index to **labels.  The fix
  is to change the SCS/* code to use 'cats->labels[i]' instead of
  'cats->list[i].labels'  There will be breakage around 'list[i].num'
  as well, and probably these can be deleted, or use 'cats->num' instead.

  Already sucessfully updated: v.random,v.extract,v.merge,v.autocorr
  updated src.contrib tree as well (10/99, Bill H.)

- src/libes/gis/set_windows.c
  There is a bug breaking a number of raster modules.
  This bug affects several commands including r.in.poly,r.digit,r.flow,
  r.bilinear, v.to.rast, ...

Jaro Hofierka on this:
  The bug is in ~src/libes/gis/set_window.c between lines 97-119.
  My quick fix was to remove these lines and re-compile gis lib and also
  all affected commands. Of course, it would be better to fix it in a more
  convenient way, however I have no time to figure out what is wrong there...
  
 ==> In GRASS 5 beta4h/4i this passage became commented as recommended by Jaro.
     The denoted modules are currently *working*! Will these comments cause
     any problems??


--------------------------------------------------------------------
src/libes/geom: optri  -> used by s.geom, v.geom
 I [Bill Hughes] have been working through some errors in 
src/libes/geom/optri and I have a tarball of the directory attached below.  
This is not done yet, but it needs some expertise from somebody who 
understands it.  Two references to grAllocate() have only 3 parameters.  
I don't understand what it does, so I can't really guess at what
should be passed as the final parameter.  I have put in 0 for the
moment to get the compile to work.

src/libes/geom/:
[from Brook] The powerof2 warnings are the result of an unfortunate 
collision of names (with different semantics) between NetBSD headers 
and Grass.  As long as the Grass headers are always included _after_ the 
system headers it is ok; it would be safer to rename it to something 
else within Grass, though.
 -> same warning on Linux/Intel
