This is "Cygwin README".

Basically Cygwin under MS-Windows does not support fifo concept. So we
needed develop new screen drivers to support Windows users. As a result,
ipc driver was developed and that is somewhat incomplete and buggy to
release. This test driver is not default driver.

If you would like to be a beta tester, just ./configure with --with-ipc option.

	./configure --with-ipc
	make
	make install
