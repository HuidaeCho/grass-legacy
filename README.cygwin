This is "Cygwin README".

Basically Cygwin under MS-Windows does not support fifo concept. So we
needed develop new screen drivers to support Windows users. As a result,
ipc driver and socket driver were developed and these are somewhat incomplete
and buggy to release. This test drivers are not default driver.

If you would like to be a beta tester, just ./configure with
--with-[ipc|socket] option.

	./configure --with-ipc	OR   ./configure --with-socket
	make
	make install
