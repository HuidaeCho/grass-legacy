1. History

This driver was written using my hpd550c paint driver as the
base.  Many routines are untouched.  It has been tested under
Grass 4.0 running Interactive Unix Version V Release 3.2.  The
main difference between this driver and the hpd550c is that it
uses the CYM palette creating a composite black from the three
colours.

2. Limitations

Since the HP DeskJet 500c cannot print on continuous paper the
length of a single paint job is limited by the media size. 
The maximum page length is 14" reduced by the required bottom
margin of 1/2" and by space for the header and footer.

A workaround for this limitation is to calculate the length of
the plot and set your region to this vertical dimension. 
Splitting of the plot into panels in the horizontal dimension
is handled by the paint software in the usual fashion.  

The following script file plots a large area calling p.map
four times - once for each horizontal strip:

     g.region n=7461700 s=7403300 w=242300 e=498300 res=100
     p.map input=pmap.inp
     g.region n=n-58400 s=s-58400
     p.map input=pmap.inp
     g.region n=n-58400 s=s-58400
     p.map input=pmap.inp
     g.region n=n-58400 s=s-58400
     p.map input=pmap.inp

where the file pmap.inp contains

     vect geology@102
       color black
       width 1
       end
     vect wholestr@102
       color blue
       width 1
       end
     scale 1:250000
     grid 10000
      numbers 1
      end
     verbose 0

3. Installation

The installation is straight forward, following the
installation manual procedures for other paint drivers.


[Edit the makefile and Gmakefile to reflect your own system
directory structure]
make

[You may need to be logged in as root to execute the following
commands]
ln /dev/lp1 /dev/hpd500c      [substitute the name of the port
                              where the DeskJet is attached
                              for lp1]
chmod 0666 /dev/hpd500c

The driver is now available on the system.  Since the printer
is able to print at 300 dpi which, on an 8" wide page, gives
2400 dots, the array sizes in P.h have been increased.

The painter hpd500c is now available for use in p.map.
