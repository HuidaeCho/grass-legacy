getutm.sh (1)

NAME
	getutm.sh is a shell script that reads a GRASS dig_ascii file
	and generates a georeferenced file that can be used as the
	input data to the MAPGEN program lines. This program is to
	be used for most GRASS files. These are the ones in UTM
	coordinates.
SYNOPSIS
	getutm.sh file

	file is the name of the GRASS dig_ascii file. Remember that
	getutm.sh does not use the GRASS LOCATION and MAPSETS therefore
	you must specify the full path to the dig_ascii file.
EXAMPLE
	getutm.sh /usr/grass/data/spearfish/PERMANENT/dig_ascii/roads
