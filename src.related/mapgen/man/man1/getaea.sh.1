getaea.sh (1)

NAME
	getaea.sh is a shell script that reads a GRASS dig_ascii file
	and generates a georeferenced file that can be used as the
	input data to the MAPGEN program lines. This program is to
	be used for GRASS files that are in the Alberts Equal Area
	projection (ie usbase data).
SYNOPSIS
	getaea.sh file

	file is the name of the GRASS dig_ascii file. Remember that
	getaea.sh does not use the GRASS LOCATION and MAPSETS therefore
	you must specify the full path to the dig_ascii file.
EXAMPLE
	getaea.sh /usr/grass/data/usbase/PERMANENT/dig_ascii/usbase.dat
