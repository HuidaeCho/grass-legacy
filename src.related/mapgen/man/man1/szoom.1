.SH NAME
szoom - display PLOTGEN/MAPGEN overlay files on Sun graphic screens
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B szoom
scale
files[s]
and/or
[program plotter options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Szoom
provides a convenient method for viewing one or more
.SM MAPGEN
or
.SM PLOTGEN
overlay files on a Sun 3 or 4 color or monochrome terminal
where
the graphic is to be scaled to the full size of the Sunview window
or normal screen and
allows the user to selectively replot sub-regions of
the display for closer examination.
In addition,
elementary digitizing and creation of a control
file compatible with
.B legend
and
.B plegend.
is provided.
.P
The first item after
.B szoom
on the run line must be either a
.SM MAPGEN
map definition file or a
.SM
PLOTGEN
scaling definition file
and there should be at least one overlay file.
These remaining files or options
are treated as normal runline arguments to program
.B plotter.
.P
.B Szoom
employs a log file
.B szoom.text
in the current working directory to record information
generated by some of the options described later.
Each time the graphic section is redrafted the contents
of the log file are processed by [p]legend to produce
an overlay file
.B szoom.text.ov
which is included as part of the redrafting.
If
.B szoom.text
does not exist it will be created and a default startup
control line is entered.
Otherwise, subsequent entries are appended to the current
contents and the current contents will be part of the
initial graphic.
It is general practice to move or copy
.B szoom.text
to another file after a work session with
.B szoom.
.P
.B Szoom
is menu driven with the options listed at the left of the
main graphic area.
Selection of the option is made by means centering the fist finger
on the menu item desired
and clicking the lefthand mouse button.
The following is a summary of currently available options:
.TP
.B Exit
.br
Exit from
.B szoom.
.TP
.B Zoom
.br
This option allows the user to select an area to be expanded
on the screen.
After selecting this option
position the fist to point to one corner of the area of intest and
click the left-hand button.
Repositioning the fist will show a rectangular box with one
corner anchored at the first position.
After locating the box to cover the area of interest reclick
the left button
(the operation may be cancelled by pressing the right button).
This area will be replotted and displayed as a full screen region.
.TP
.B deZoom
.br
Zoom levels are \(``remembered\('' and the user may
return to the previous level by selecting this option.
.TP
.B Home
.br
This option returns to the original full plot scaling.
.TP
.B Pan
.br
If the screen is in zoom mode the plot may be panned by
positioning the fist at a current location, clicking the left button
and selecting a new position on the screen where the first
one should be moved to in order to define the pan.
Clicking the left button at this new position starts the pan operation.
.TP
.B Line
.br
This option provides for digitizing a series of vectors whose
coordinates are recorded in the log file by clicking the
left button at each of the nodes selected.
The operation is discontinued when the right button is clicked.
.TP
.B Poly
.br
.B Poly
is the same as
.B Line
except that the when drafting is discontinued (right button click)
a closure vector to the first point is made (thus a poly-line).
.TP
.B Text
.br
Clicking the left button at the desired position will record
the coordinates in the log file
and prompt the user for text at the bottom of the
screen.
The text entered is also recorded in the log file until
a line beginning with a period is entered.
.TP
.B "< Text"
.br
An option similar to
.B Text
except that a second position must be clicked which will define
the angle at which the text is to be rotated.
.TP
.B Mark
.br
Clicking the left cursor button at a select position will
cause a \f(CW-xy\fR coordinate pair to be entered in the log.
A permanent graphic operation is not directly associated with
this option.
.TP
.B "ctl text"
.br
The user is prompted to enter text at the bottom of the screen
which will be recorded in the log file.
A null line terminates the option.
This is useful when it is desirable to change or add
.B [p]legend
options.
.TP
.B RePlt
.br
An occasionally useful operation which forces redrafting of the
screen from the overlays and log file.

.SH BUGS
There is no prevision to digitize in data coordinates.
.br
Line digitizing cannot span the current window.
.SH CAVEATS
When digitizing from a terminal the resolution of the screen
will determine the accuracy of the digitized values.
To minimize this effect the zoom feature should be used to
enlarge the region of digiting interest.
.P
The coordinates digitized are in centimeters relative to the
lower left hand corner of the plot sheet.
Users must ensure that appropriate setting of the
.B [p]legend
switches are made prior to executing
.B szoom's
output file.
