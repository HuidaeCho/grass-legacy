.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Preview
provides a convenient method for viewing one or more
.I MAPGEN
or
.I PLOTGEN
overlay files on the host terminal or other devices for which
the graphic is to be scaled to the full size of the device.
.P
The
.B zoom
version allows the user to selectively replot sub-regions of
the display for closer examination.
In addition,
.B zoom
provides for elementary digitizing and creation of control
files compatible with
.B legend
and
.B plegend.
.P
The following options must appear in order indicated:
.TP
.BI [plotter\ options]
.br
Any of the program
.B plotter
options may be specified.
.TP
.BI "[ \-m ]" " scale"
.br
This option specifies the scaling definition file
employed by the other
.I PLOTGEN
or
.I MAPGEN
graphic functions when creating the set of overlays to
be plotted.
The usage of the
.B \-m
is only required when plotter options are specified.
.TP
.I files[s]
.br
One or more overlay files generated by the 
.I MAPGEN
or
.I PLOTGEN
system employing the specified definition file.
.P
When the cursor first appears on the screen when using
.B zoom
the user has seven control options
.B
(q, h, p, d, a,
.R
and
.B l)
selected by typing a single key:
.TP
.B q
to quit the execution of
.B zoom
and return to the system.
.TP
.B h
to redisplay the initial plot.
.TP
.B p
to redisplay the previous level of zoom.
.TP
.B space bar
.br
initiates either zoom or pan operations.
.IP
When the using the zoom or enlargement operation
the space bar should
be struck after the cursor is positioned at one corner of the area
to be expanded.
A cross will be drafted at this corner and the cursor will reappear.
After moving the cursor to the opposite corner of the selected
window the space character should be reentered.
A second cross at this location will be made and the system will
wait for a <CR> before continuing with redrafting the selected window.
Note that the region selected must have some area (not a line)
otherwise the cursor will reappear and the second cursor
entry operation ignored.
.IP
For panning or shifting the plot without rescaling the size the
cursor should be positioned on the screen at the point which is
to be moved to a new position designated by the next cursor entry.
After space character is entered
a cross is annotated and the cursor reappears.
The cursor now
should be moved to the new position on the screen where the first
point is to be shifted and a
.B non-blank
character entered.
Remaining action is the same as for the zoom operation.
.IP
In the panning operations, stacking of the plot levels may be
bypassed by entering a 0 (numeric zero) as the non-blank
character for the second cursor position.
.TP
.B d
key will cause the digitized value at the cursor position
to be written out in
.B legend/plegend
compatible form.
When either of the
.B d, a,
or
.B l
keys are first activated
.B zoom
will prompt for the name of the file for the digitized information.
In addition, the user may enter text information after the
coordinates of the digitized point.
.TP
.B a
key acts in a similar manner to the
.B d
key except that the cursor reappears after a cross is drawn
so the user may determine an angle for orientation of
the following text.
The angle computed is determined  by the azimuth from the initial
point to the new crosshair position.
.TP
.B l
key indicates the beginning point of line coordinate data.
The cursor will reappear and for each space key entry
a new coordinate will be determined.
In addition, the line information will be drawn on the screen
as each point is entered.
Line drafting is terminated by a non-space key entry.
.P
Striking an invalid key will cause the terminal's bell
to ring and no action will be taken.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
 Error monitoring only.
.SH BUGS
Current version only works with a GraphOn terminal in
digitizing mode.
.P
There is no prevision to digitize in data coordinates.
.br
Line digitizing cannot span the current window.
.SH CAVEATS
When digitizing from a terminal the resolution of the screen
will determine the accuracy of the digitized values.
To minimize this effect the zoom feature should be used to
enlarge the region of digiting interest.
.P
The coordinates digitized are in centimeters relative to the
lower left hand corner of the plot sheet.
Users must ensure that appropriate setting of the
.B [p]legend
switches are made prior to executing
.B zoom's
output file.
