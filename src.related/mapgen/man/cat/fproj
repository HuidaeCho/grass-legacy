_F_p_r_o_j is similar to _p_r_o_j except that it uses  the  Che-
byshev  approximation  coefficients  generated  by _p_r_o_j
with the -_T  switch.   All  the  cartographic  aspects,
including  forward-inverse,  are  defined  by the ASCII
coefficient file input to this program by either the -_T
option or as the first element of the input data steam.

     The following run-line parameters  can  appear  in
any  order:  Special  option for binary coordinate data
input and output through standard  input  and  standard
output.   Data  is  assumed to be in system type _d_o_u_b_l_e
floating point words.  This option is to be  used  when
_p_r_o_j  is  a _s_o_n process and allows bypassing formatting
operations.  If binary input is used the -_T switch  for
selecting  the  coefficient file must be used.  Selects
binary input only (see -_boption).  Selects binary  out-
put  only  (see  -_boption).   _A  specifies  a character
employed as the first character  to  denote  a  control
line  to  be  passed  through without processing.  This
option applicable to  ascii  input  only.   (#  is  the
default  value).   _S_t_r_i_n_g  is an arbitrary string to be
output if an error is detected during data  transforma-
tions.   The  default value is: *\t*.  Note that if the
-_b, -_i or -_o options are employed, an error is returned
as  _H_U_G_E  value  for both return values.  _F_i_l_e contains
the Chebyshev coefficient data  determined  by  program
_p_r_o_j.   This option must be employed if binary input is
used.  This options reverses the order of the  expected
input  from  longitude-latitude  or  x-y  to  latitude-
longitude or y-x.  This options reverses the  order  of
the  output  from  x-y  or longitude-latitude to y-x or
latitude-longitude.  _F_o_r_m_a_t is a _p_r_i_n_t_f  format  string
to  control the form of the output values.  For inverse
projections, the output will be in  degrees  when  this
option  is  employed.   If  a  format  is specified for
inverse projection the output data will be  in  decimal
degrees.   The  default format is %.2f for forward pro-
jection and DMS for inverse.  _N is the number of signi-
ficant  fractional  digits to employ for seconds output
(when the option is not  specified,  -_w_3  is  assumed).
When  -_W  is employed the fields will be constant width
with leading zeroes.

     One or more _f_i_l_e_s  (processed  in  left  to  right
order)  specify  the  source of data to be transformed.
If the -_T option is not used the Chebyshev  coefficient
data  must  preceed  any data in the input stream.  A -
will specify the location of processing standard input.
If  no  files are specified, the input is assumed to be

from _s_t_d_i_n.  For ASCII input data the two  data  values
must  be  in the first two white space separated fields
and when both input and output are ASCII  all  trailing
portions  of  the input line are appended to the output
line.

     Input geographic  data  (longitude  and  latitude)
must  be in DMS format and input cartesian data must be
in units consistent with the ellipsoid  major  axis  or
sphere  radius  units.   Output  geographic coordinates
will be in DMS (if the -_w switch is not  employed)  and
precise  to  0.001"  with trailing, zero-valued minute-
second fields deleted.
