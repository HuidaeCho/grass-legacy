_G_e_o_d (direct) and _i_n_v_g_e_o_d  (inverse)  perform  geodesic
(Great  Circle)  computations for determining latitude,
longitude and back azimuth of a terminus point given  a
initial point latitude, longitude, azimuth and distance
(direct) or the forward and back azimuths and  distance
between  an  initial  and  terminus point latitudes and
longitudes (inverse).

     The  following  runline  control  parameters   can
appear  in any order: -_a Latitude and longitudes of the
initial and terminal points, forward and back  azimuths
and  distance  are  output.   _A  specifies  a character
employed as the first character  to  denote  a  control
line  to be passed through without processing.  _F_i_l_e is
the source file name of  additional  +  option  control
data for the projection procedures.  _F_o_r_m_a_t is a _p_r_i_n_t_f
format string to control the output form  of  the  geo-
graphic  coordinate  values  (f) or distance value (F).
The default mode is DMS for geographic coordinates  and
"%.3f"  for  distance.   _N is the number of significant
fractional digits to employ for  seconds  output  (when
the  option is not specified, -_w_3 is assumed).  When -_W
is employed the fields  will  be  constant  width  with
leading  zeroes.   -_p  This option causes the azimuthal
values to be output as unsigned numbers between  0  and
360.

     The +_a_r_g_s run-line arguments are  associated  with
geodetic  parameters  -_c  option  where the + prefix is
optional.  The options are processed in left  to  right
order  from  the  run  line  followed by processing the
entries in the  -_c  file.   Reentry  of  an  option  is
ignored  with  the  first  occurance  assumed to be the
desired value.

     One or more _f_i_l_e_s  (processed  in  left  to  right
order) specify the source of data to be transformed.  A
- will specify  the  location  of  processing  standard
input.  If no files are specified, the input is assumed
to be from _s_t_d_i_n.

     For direct determinations input data  must  be  in
latitude,  longitude,  azimuth  and  distance order and
output will be latitude, longitude and back azimuth  of
the terminus point.  Latitude, longitude of the initial
and terminus point are input for the inverse  mode  and
respective  forward  and  back azimuth from the initial
and terminus points are output along with the  distance

between the points.

     Input geographic coordinates (latitude and  longi-
tude)  and  azimuthal  data  must  be in DMS format and
input distance data must be in  units  consistent  with
the  ellipsoid major axis or sphere radius units.  Out-
put geographic coordinates will be in DMS  (if  the  -_f
switch  is not employed) to 0.001" with trailing, zero-
valued minute-second fields deleted.   Output  distance
data  will  be  in  the  same units as the ellipsoid or
sphere radius.

     The Earth's ellipsoidal figure may be selected  in
the  same manner as program _p_r_o_j by using +_e_l_l_p_s=, +_a=,
+_e_s=, etc.  _G_e_o_d can be used in  the  inverse  mode  by
specifying +_i_n_v.

     _G_e_o_d may also be used  to  determine  intermediate
points  along either a geodesic line between two points
or along an arc of specified distance from a geographic
point.   In  both cases an initial point must be speci-
fied with and parameters and either  a  terminus  point
and  or  a  distance and azimuth from the initial point
with and must be specified.

     If points along a geodesic are  to  be  determined
then  either  specifying  the  number  of  intermediate
points  and/or  specifying  the  incremental   distance
between points must be specified.

     To determine points along an arc equidistant  from
the  initial  point  both  and  must be specified which
determine the respective angular increments and  number
of points to be determined.
