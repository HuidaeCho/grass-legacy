_b_i_v_a_r [ -cefmorstvw [args]] [ file ]

_B_i_v_a_r determines a set of bivariate polynomial  coeffi-
cients  which  will approximate the bivariate data con-
tained in _f_i_l_e.  The bivariate polynomial is  expressed
as:

        f(x,y) = Cmn * Pm(x) * Qn(y) [m=0,M, [n=0,n]]

where the univariate degree M may  be  user  specified.
Univariate  polynomials P and Q can be either monomials
or Chebyshev.  The coefficients are determined from the
input x, y and z data (optionally with weighting terms)
by standard least squares methods.  The range of the  x
and  y  data is reduced to the interval of +1 and -1 to
assist in the determination.

Output consists of the error level  of  the  determina-
tion,  number  of  coefficients determined.  The second
two lines contain the scaling, offset and  minumum  and
maximum   values  of  the  respective  x  and  y  axis.
Finally, the last sequence  of  data  consists  of  the
number  of  coefficients  of  the  set  of coefficients
evaluating with minimal error, the  absolute  value  of
the maximum error and the ordered coefficient values.

The following options can appear in any order: If  this
option  is  selected  then  the Chebyshev polynomial is
employed.  Otherwise the default selection is a  simple
monomial  series.   _E_p_s_i_l_o_n  is  a floating point value
which determines relative tolerance test  for  loss  of
significance.   Reasonable values are between 1e-10 and
1e-15; default: 1e-15.  _e_t_a is a floating  point  value
which  determines  relative tolerance for square sum of
errors.  Reasonable values are  between  1  and  1e-15;
default: 1e-15.  _F_a_c_t_o_r is a floating point value which
expands the computed range of the  dependent  variables
by  the specified relative value.  Default: 0..  _D_e_g_r_e_e
is an integral value which determines the maximum poly-
nomial  degree  in  either  axis.   _S_i_z_e is an integral
value which specifies the maximum number of data values
to  be  input  in determination of the series.  Default
value: 200.  _F_i_l_e is the name  of  an  optional  output
file for results.  If not specified, _s_y_s_o_u_t is implied.
Format is and ascii string of C "scanf" format form  to
allow handling of specialized data not in the form of 3
(or 4) floating point values per line.  If -_w is speci-
fied  then a weight value is associated with each input
data item.  If -_x is specified then the relative  posi-
tion  of the _x and _y values on each input data line are
reversed.  When specified _b_i_v_a_r becomes verbose in  its

operation.   Each line of the specified _f_i_l_e contains a
set of real values: x, y, z  and  optionally  a  weight
value.   If the data are not deformatable with a simple
sequence of "%le" format specifications the  -_f  option
must  be employed.  If a _f_i_l_e is not specified _s_t_d_i_n is
assumed.
