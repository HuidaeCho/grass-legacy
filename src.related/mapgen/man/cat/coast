_C_o_a_s_t is a  graphic  function  in  the  MAPGEN  graphic
series  which  provides  for creating map overlays from
compressed line data  files.   Most  of  the  following
options  can appear in any order: This option specifies
the required map definition file.  If the -_m  is  omit-
ted,  _d_e_f__f_i_l_e  must  be  the  first file listed.  This
option specifies the map overlay metagraphic file.   If
this  option is specified, a plot of the coastline file
is output to  the  controlling  terminal.   It  the  -_o
option  is  omitted,  then -_i is implied.  This options
provides for run-line  inclusion  of  graphic  options.
The  optional  _f_i_l_e contains additional graphic control
options.  One or more  _f_i_l_e_s  of  compressed  coastline
source  data  may  be  specified.  These _f_i_l_e names are
".cdr"/".cdt"  suffixed  files  generally  created   by
_m_k_c_o_a_s_t.   The  following  options  provide for graphic
control and may only appear in the -_c run-line field or
the  -_s control file.  Note that symbol line generation
is supported and if selected the -_s,  -_a,  -_c,  and  -_r
options must be specified.  When multiple feature codes
are selected the line characteristics of  the  previous
feature code selection remain in effected until altered
by a new option.  _S_t_r may contain up to 8 characters of
symbols  to  be used with symbol line generation.  _N_a_m_e
is the name of the symbol font to be employed with sym-
bol line generation.  _D_i_s_t is the inter-symbol distance
in centimeters when employing symbol  lines.   _S_i_z_e  is
the nominal size of the line symbols in centimeters.
Do not draft the symbol  line  with  intervening  line.
Default mode.
Connect line symbols with selected line  method.   This
option  provides  for selection of only those line seg-
ments in the coastline files which  have  the  selected
feature  codes.   _N_s  specifies  the lower range of the
feature code number.   If  _n_e  is  specified,  it  will
define the upper range; otherwise, only the _n_s value is
employed.  There may be more  than  one  set  of  _n_s-_n_e
sets.  For example:
        -f 0-10,20,30-35
specifies feature codes 0 to  10,  20  and  30  to  35.
Omission  of this option implies that all feature codes
are to be plotted.  This option specifies  that  dashed
lines  are  to  be employed with _s_i_z_e specified in real
centimeters.  _M_a_s_k  is  either  a  decimal,  octal,  or
hecadecimal number specifying the dash pattern.
_N is a mechanical pen to be employed with the coastline
feature.  Each of the above options may be repeated for
different sets of feature codes by delimiting each  set
with  a  -.   If  there  is  an overlap of feature code
