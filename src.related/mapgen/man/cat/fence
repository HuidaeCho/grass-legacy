_F_e_n_c_e is a  graphic  function  in  the  _m_a_p_g_e_n  graphic
series which provides for creating fence or profile map
overlays from geographic coordinate and 'z'  axis  data
field[s].   Most of the following options can appear in
any order:  This  option  specifies  the  required  map
definition  file.   If the -_m is omitted, _d_e_f__f_i_l_e must
be the first file listed.  This  option  specifies  the
map  overlay  meta-graphic  file.   If  this  option is
specified a "preview" of the graphic file is output  to
the  controlling  terminal.   It the option is omitted,
then is implied.  This options  provides  for  run-line
inclusion of graphic options listed below.  If there is
more than one option or imbedded blanks, the field must
be  enclosed  in  quotes  or apostrophies.  One or more
data _f_i_l_e_s that contain geographic, posting and control
data.  If no files are specified, or if a - argument is
encountered,  _f_e_n_c_e  reads  from  the  standard  input.
Files  are  processed in left to right order.  The fol-
lowing options provide for graphic control and may only
appear  in  the  -_c run-line field or the data file[s].
Control data in the data files must be on lines with  a
'#' character in column one.  A second '#' character on
these lines causes the remainder  of  the  line  to  be
ignore  and,  consequently,  may  be used for comments.
This option specifies a "break" in the line.   Drafting
of  all  data channels will be discontinued at the last
point and restarted at the next data point.   _F_l_o_n  and
_f_l_a_t  are  the  respective  field  control words of the
longitude and latitude data fields (data must be in DMS
format).   Both  field  control  words  are of the form
[_f][.[_o][._l]] where _f is the field  number,  _o  is  the
number  of characters to skip from the beginning of the
field, and _l is the length of the field.  If _l  is  not
specified  or  0,  then  the  remainder of the field is
employed.  If _f or _o are  omitted  then  1  and  0  are
respective assumptions.  If this option is omitted then
a default of "-d 2,1" is assumed.  This option  selects
the  z  axis  data  'channel' for reference by the line
control options.  Values of _n correspond to  the  field
values  specified by the option.  If _n<= then line con-
trol refers to the pen drafting fence posts  and  other
options.   The  default channel selected at start-up is
1.  The value of _f_f_n defines the data  field[s]  to  be
drafted.  The format of _f_f_n is the same form as for the
"-d" option.  Specification of the data  fields  should
be  made  only  once.  If the value of _m is d then dash
line mode is selected otherwise solid line  mode.   _A_r_g
is  the  value for the dash line mask for the currently
selected channel.  It is treated as a 16  bit  quantity

where  each  on  bit  is  a solid segment of the dashed
line.  Note that it must be entered as a decimal, octal
or hexadecimal value (123, 0123 or 0x123 respectively).
_C_m is the size of the dash line interval in centimeters
for the currently selected channel.  If the value of _c_m
is zero, solid line mode is assumed.  Start drafting of
the  currently selected channel.  To terminate drafting
of current channel see Stop drafting of  current  chan-
nel.   To  restart  drafting  of a channel see _N is the
mechanical pen to be employed for the currently  speci-
fied  channel.  If this option controls vertical bar or
"fence post" drafting.  If _m is =1 a single fence  post
will  be  drafted  at the next point, if >1 fence posts
will be drafted at each point, and if  <=0  fence  post
drafting  terminated.   The  initial  value  is 0.  The
values of _z__m_i_n/_m_a_x and _c__m_i_n/_m_a_x define the respective
data and centimeter values of the vertical axis scaling
range.  Z-axis scaling is determined by the equivalency
of _z__m_i_n to _c__m_i_n and _z__m_a_x to _c__m_a_x.  If the values of
_c__m_i_n/_m_a_x are negative they are below the  datum  value
of  the  geographic  coordinate location.  The z values
are not windowed and may be plotted beyond  the  ranges
specified.   Positive  _c__m_i_n  or  negative _c__m_a_x values
should be avoided as they will cause the fence pole  to
float  above  or below the geographic coordinate.  This
parameter must be specied and applies to  all  channels
selected.  _A_n_g is the clockwise angle (in degrees) that
the z axis is to be shifted  from  the  vertical.   The
default  value  is 0 degrees.  The character _c, immedi-
ately  following  -_t,  delimits  data  fields  on  data
records (default: "t\t" (tab)).  Use of special charac-
ters may require quote mark enclosure.  The character _c
immediately following z will replace the normal # char-
acter indicating control line and comment.
