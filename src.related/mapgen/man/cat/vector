_V_e_c_t_o_r is a  graphic  function  in  the  MAPGEN/PLOTGEN
graphic  series  which  provides for creating vector or
line metagraphic overlays from geographic or  cartesian
coordinate data file[s].

     Most of the following options can  appear  in  any
order:  This option specifies the required plot scaling
file which may be either a map or cartesian  definition
file.  If the -_m is omitted, _d_e_f__f_i_l_e must be the first
file listed.  This option specifies a new overlay meta-
graphic  file.   If the file already exists, it will be
overwritten.  This option specifies appending the over-
lay  metagraphic  to an existing overlay file.  If _f_i_l_e
does not exist, it will be created.  If this option  is
specified,  a plot of the graphic file is output to the
controlling terminal.  If the  -_o  or  -_a  options  are
omitted, then -_i is implied.  This options provides for
run-line inclusion of graphic options listed below.  If
there  is  more than one option or imbedded blanks, the
field must be enclosed in quotes or apostrophies.   The
contents  of  this  option is processed before the data
files.

     One or more data _f_i_l_e_s that contain geographic  or
x-y  data  (depending  upon _d_e_f__f_i_l_e type), and control
data.  If no files are specified, or if a - argument is
encountered,  _v_e_c_t_o_r  reads  from  the  standard input.
Files are processed in left to right order.

     The following options provide for graphic  control
and  may  only  appear  in the -_c run-line field or the
data file[s].  Control data in the data files  must  be
on  lines with a # character in column one.  A second #
character on these lines causes the  remainder  of  the
line  to  be ignored and, consequently, may be used for
comments.

     Vector or  line  drafting  has  three  methods  of
display:  solid  lines,  dashed lines and symbol lines.
Symbol lines are similar to dashed  lines  except  that
the graphic employed in lieu of the dash segment may be
any character(s) from the font  selected.   The  symbol
line  form  may  be  combined  with either the solid or
dashed line option.  The font selected by the -_f deter-
mines  the  character  set  used by the the symbol line
generator.  This option provides  for  controlling  the
method and character of lines.  Argument _p_e_n designates
the mechanical pen to be employed in drafting and  must
be  specified with each usage.  The remaining arguments

may be optionally specified but when omitted the  posi-
tion  must be indicated with appropriate comma (,) del-
imiters (ie. # -B 0,,,1,.2,\010 #- _m_a_s_k and _s_i_z_e  unal-
tered).

     _M_a_s_k and _s_i_z_e control  dash  line  drafting  where
     _m_a_s_k  is  specification of the 16 bit dash pattern
     to be employed and _s_i_z_e is the  size  of  the  bit
     element  of the mask pattern in centimeters.  Note
     that the total  length  of  the  dash  pattern  is
     16x_s_i_z_e  centimeters.   If _m_a_s_k is -1 then a solid
     line is drafted and _s_i_z_e is ignored and when  _m_a_s_k
     is 0 line drafting is suspended (0 is usually only
     employed with symbol line drafting).  _M_a_s_k is usu-
     ally  specified as a hexadecimal value (ie. 0xCCCC
     for a small dash bit pattern of 1010101010101010)

     Lines with symbol patterns may be created by using
     the  _d_i_s_t,ssize  and _s_t_r options where _d_i_s_t is the
     inter-symbol distance in centimeters, _s_s_i_z_e is the
     size of the symbol in centimeters.

     _S_t_r is any string of one to 128  symbols  selected
     from the selected character font to be employed in
     a repeated manner when drafting symbol  lines.   A
     special symbol (\177) may be employed to denote an
     empty point in the symbol  sequence.   Any  symbol
     (including  the  empty point symbol) with the most
     significant bit (sign) set will cause 180 rotation
     of the current and following _s_t_r (if any) symbols.
     At the start of each cycle through _s_t_r the charac-
     ter rotation is set to 0 so that if a line is pro-
     gressing from  left  to  right  the  symbol  would
     appear  right  side  up.  If a single symbol is to
     appear in a reverse manner  then  \200  should  be
     added  (i.e.  a reverse rotation letter A would be
     \301).  To  create  a  sequence  of  symbols  with
     alternating rotation then two or more symbols must
     be used with the sign set  on  some  symbol  other
     than  the first.  For example, -a A\301 will cause
     the letter A to be plotted with alternating  rota-
     tion.

     The cyclic operation though _s_t_r can  be  inhibited
     by  terminating  _s_t_r with the \377 special charac-
     ter.  This permits this option to be employed  for
     drafting  curved annotation based on the following
     line data.  With this feature the drafting of  the
     line   is   normally   turned   off   (ie.   #  -L
     ,0,,.01,.3,Example\ Line\377).  This option  (geo-
     graphic coordinates only) provides for the genera-
     tion of rhumb lines (lines  of  constant  azimuth)
     when  _n is a positive value.  The larger the value
     of _n the coarser the rhumb fit  will  be  and  the

     greater  likelyhood  of visible straight line seg-
     ments.  Generally a selection of -_R3 is considered
     and  optimal  value  for publication work.  When _n
     zero or absent normal  lines  directly  connecting
     coordinates  are  employed.   When  employed  with
     non-rhumb lines in a single control-data file a -_b
     should separate line segments.  This option speci-
     fies a break in the line.  Line drafting  will  be
     discontinued  at  the  last point and restarted at
     the next data point.  _X-_c_o_o_r_d and _y-_c_o_o_r_d are  the
     respective field control words of either the long-
     itude and latitude data fields (data  must  be  in
     DMS  format)  or  the  x-y  cartesian coordinates.
     Both  field  control  words  are   of   the   form
     [_f][.[_o][._l]]  where  _f  is the field number, _o is
     the number of characters to skip from  the  begin-
     ning  of  the  field,  and  _l is the length of the
     field.  If _l is  not  specified  or  0,  then  the
     remainder of the field is employed.  If _f or _o are
     omitted then 1 and 0 are  respective  assumptions.
     If  this option is omitted then a default value of
     "-d 2,1" is assumed for geographic coordinates and
     "-d  1,2"  for  x-y  data.   _N_a_m_e is the name of a
     graphic system font to be employed for the  symbol
     line  characters.   Names of fonts in the standard
     font library are preceeded by a  -.   If  omitted,
     the  graphic  system  default  character  font  is
     selected ( # -f -).  The character _c,  immediately
     following -_t, delimits data fields on data records
     (default: "t\t" (tab)).  Use of special characters
     may  require " or ' mark enclosure on the runline.
     The character  _c  immediately  following  -_z  will
     replace  the normal # character that indicate con-
     trol line and comment.  The  -_x  option  specifies
     that  the following lines contain x-y data in cen-
     timeter board units which outline, in  a  counter-
     clockwise manner, an area where vector plotting is
     to be suppressed.  For less than two input coordi-
     nate  values the operation is ignored with a warn-
     ing.  If two lines of data follow then  this  pair
     of   coordinates  represents  diagonally  opposite
     corners of a rectangular region.   For  more  than
     two  lines  of coordinate pairs the region is con-
     sidered to be a polygonal outline.   If  the  last
     coordinate  of  a  polygon set is not identical to
     the first point, closure is forced by appending  a
     copy  of  the first line.  The list of coordinates
     is terminated by any control line.

     All of the data must be inside the  maximum  board
     size  of  the plot and the region must have a non-
     zero area.  The maximum number of points  defining
     a polygon region is currently limited to 100.
