_p_p_o_i_n_t [ -oi [args]] [ files ]

_P_p_o_i_n_t is a graphic function  in  the  _P_L_O_T_G_E_N  graphic
series which provides for creating point and/or posting
overlays from x-y coordinate data file[s].  The follow-
ing run-line options can appear in any order:
This option  specifies  the  map  overlay  meta-graphic
file.
If this option is specified a "preview" of the  graphic
file  is output to the controlling terminal.  It the -_o
option is omitted, then -_i is  implied.   One  or  more
data  _f_i_l_e_s that contain x-y, posting and control data.
If no files are  specified,  or  if  a  -  argument  is
encountered,  _p_p_o_i_n_t  reads  from  the  standard input.
Files are processed in left to right order.   The  ini-
tial  control information in the input data stream must
be scaling options as defined in the _p_l_t_g_e_n(_5) descrip-
tion.   The  following options provide for graphic con-
trol and may only appear in the data file[s]  and  must
be on lines with a # character in column one.  A second
# character on these lines causes the remainder of  the
line  to  be ignored and, consequently, may be used for
comments.  There are two basic modes of _p_p_o_i_n_t'_s opera-
tion:  point  plotting  where  a symbol is displayed at
each x-y coordinate  and  posting  where  one  or  more
fields  of data from the data record are printed at the
x-y  point.   Consequently,  several  options   require
either  an  s  or c prefix to denote whether the option
applies to the respective  point  or  posting  control.
For  example selects point font while selects the post-
ing font.
When -_c occurs as a solitary option the subsequent data
posting fields are to be plotted.
This option selects the point symbol  to  be  employed.
If _a_r_g is a numeric value then it is the numeric selec-
tion of the symbol otherwise the ascii value.
_F_x and _f_y are the respective field control words of the
x-axis  and  y-axis  data  fields.   Both field control
words are of the form  [_f][.[_o][._l]]  where  _f  is  the
field  number,  _o  is  the number of characters to skip
from the beginning of the field, and _l is the length of
the field.  If _l is not specified or 0, then the entire
field is employed.  If _f or _o are omitted then 1 and  0
are  respective assumptions.  If this option is omitted
then a default of "-d 1,2" is assumed.
The list of field control words following  this  option
defines the data fields to be posted.  The format of _f_f
is the same as for the -_d option.
_N_a_m_e is the  name  of  a  graphic  system  font  to  be
employed for the point (s) or posting (c) operations.
_C_h_r selects justification mode for posting data: c  for

centered, l for left and r for right.  Default justifi-
cation is left.
Set the interline spacing (leading) to _n / 8 times  the
character  size.  If not specified for multiple fields,
the posting data will overplot.  A typical value of  12
(1.5 times) usually works well.
_N is the mechanical pen to be employed.
Discontinue point (s) or posting (c) mode.
_A_n_g is the number  of  counter  clockwise  degrees  the
posted  data  (c)  or point symbol (s) is to be rotated
about the x-y point.  When  -_s  occurs  as  a  solitary
option then point plotting is to commence at subsequent
data values.
_S_i_z_e is the nominal size of the point  (s)  or  posting
(c) characters in centimeters.
The character _c, immediately following _t, delimits data
fields on data records (default: (tab)).
_C_m is the number of centimeters along  the  x-axis  the
beginning  of  the  posting string is to be offset from
the x-y coordinate  location.   Note:  offset  is  made
prior to rotation.
Option similar to -_c_x except that for offset along  the
y-axis.
The character _c_h_r will replace the normal  #  character
indicating control line and comment.
