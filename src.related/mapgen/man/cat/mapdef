_m_a_p_d_e_f [ -cspvk [args]] [ -m ] file

_M_a_p_d_e_f is used for creating  the  map  definition  file
required  by  all  _M_A_P_G_E_N  programs  creating overlays.
Modifying scale and window  parameters  and  displaying
current  characteristcs  of  definition file parameters
may also be performed by _m_a_p_d_e_f.  The following options
can  appear  in  any order: _F_i_l_e is the name of the map
definition file and must be specified.  The use of  the
-_m  tag  is  optional  and for historical reasons only.
This option specifies that geographic elements  of  the
map  definition (ie. geographic range, projection, etc.
) are to be specified by subsequent _s_t_d_i_n data.  If the
map  definition file already exits, the new information
will overwrite the previous definitions.  Unless the -_s
switch  is  also  selected the map definition file will
not be in a scaled state upon completion of  execution.
This  option  indicates that scaling (and optional res-
caling) as well as boundary control of the map  defini-
tion  file  will be specified by subsequent _s_t_d_i_n data.
This  option   provides   for   conversion   of   _s_t_d_i_n
longitude-latitude  geographic  data to map space (both
centimeters and  plotter  counts).   This  option  only
applies  when the definition file is in a scaled state.
This option makes _M_A_P_G_E_N verbose in its  prompting  and
diagnostics.  _C_p_c is a real number denoting the graphic
device counts per centimeter  for  the  plotter  device
intended  to  produce  a  true  scale map.  The default
value is installation dependent and usually tailored to
the  principle hard copy plotter.  See your _M_A_P_G_E_N sys-
tem manager if there are special requirements.   Ignor-
ing this option should produce desired results.  Subse-
quent  control  input  information  determined  by  the
option switches is obtained from _s_t_d_i_n in a fixed order
shown in the following description.  Data responses for
switch  -_c  are:  Geographic  range in the form of wes-
terly,  easterly  longitude,  southerly  and  northerly
latitude optionally followed by central meridian value.
If the central meridian is omitted,  the  mean  of  the
specified  longitude  range is used as a default.  This
line contains + projection control options as  employed
by  program _p_r_o_j and must, at least, define the projec-
tion to be employed by a "+proj=name" entry.  A  refer-
ence  to  program  _p_r_o_j  documentation  is required for
available projections and associated parameters.

     In certain situations,  it  may  be  desirable  to
     increase  the  degree  of polynomial approximation
     employed by the _M_A_P_G_E_N system  by  beginning  this
     line  with  a  integral  value  of  the polynomial
     degree.  When omitted, the default is  _8  and  the

     maximum  value is currently _1_2.  At the completion
     of the -_c option phase several minutes of  compute
     time  may be required to determine the approximat-
     ing polynomial coefficients employed by  the  sys-
     tem.    A  scale  fraction  denominator  value  is
     expected.  If a '0' is  entered  the  system  goes

     nate pair of two points followed by their  separa-
     tion in centimeters.  This line should contain the
     counter-clockwise rotation  (in  degrees)  of  the
     geographic  axis  relative  to the plot.  A '0' or
     <cr> causes no rotation.  At this time the size in
     centimeters of the area required by the full range
     of geographic data is displayed  when  in  verbose
     mode.   The  following lines will define the final
     data and map windowing.  The purpose of this  con-
     trol  line  is two-fold: specify the origin of the
     data area relative to the lower-left corner of the
     plot  and  adjust  the  data limits defined by the
     geographic range.  The first two  values  are  the
     respective   x-y  coordinates  of  the  lower-left
     corner of the data area  in  centimeters  (default
     value 3 cm.).

     Redefining the data region is performed by follow-
     ing  the  origin  data  with up to four geographic
     longitude-latitude coordinate pairs for respective
     minimum  x  and y range and maximum x and y range.
     Default values are  determined  by  original  geo-
     graphic range.

     Since this information is dependent upon its rela-
     tive  position  on  the  data  line, indication of
     acceptance of leading default values is  indicated
     by  a  - for both x and y origin coordinates and a
     single hyphen for longitude-latitude  pairs.   For
     example:  "-  -  -  140w 45n" will cause a default
     data origin of 3 cm. and  a  new  minimum  y  data
     range  value  determined  by  the given geographic
     coordinates.

     _M_a_p_d_e_f will display the resultant size of the  map
     at  the completion of this control line in verbose
     mode.  The size of the right and top margin may be
     specified  by  entering their respective values on
     this line.  Default values are 3 cm.  The user may
     determine  the  attributes of a previously created
     definition file by using  the  "-v  name"  option.
     Note   that  diagnostic  information  (except  for
     errors) will not be printed unless  the  verbosity
     switch is also selected.
