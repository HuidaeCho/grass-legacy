_l_i_n_e_s [ -oci [args]] [ -m ] def_file [ files ]

_L_i_n_e_s is a  graphic  function  in  the  MAPGEN  graphic
series  which  provides for creating line, point and/or
posting map overlays from  geographic  coordinate  data
file[s].   Although  _l_i_n_e_s  performs  many  of the same
operations as _p_o_i_n_t_s, it is recomended that  _p_o_i_n_t_s  be
employed  when dealing with purely posting/point opera-
tions as it suffers  considerably  less  overhead  than
_l_i_n_e_s.  Most of the following options can appear in any
order: This option specifies the required  map  defini-
tion  file.  If the -_m is omitted, _d_e_f__f_i_l_e must be the
first file listed.  This option specifies the map over-
lay  metagraphic  file.  If this option is specified, a
plot of the graphic file is output to  the  controlling
terminal.   If  the  -_o  option  is omitted, then -_i is
implied.  This options provides for run-line  inclusion
of graphic options listed below.  If there is more than
one option  or  imbedded  blanks,  the  field  must  be
enclosed  in  quotes or apostrophies.  One or more data
_f_i_l_e_s that contain  geographic,  posting,  and  control
data.  If no files are specified, or if a - argument is
encountered,  _l_i_n_e_s  reads  from  the  standard  input.
Files  are  processed in left to right order.  The fol-
lowing options provide for graphic control and may only
appear  in  the  -_c run-line field or the data file[s].
Control data in the data files must be on lines with  a
#  character  in  column  one.  A second # character on
these lines causes the remainder  of  the  line  to  be
ignored  and,  consequently,  may be used for comments.
There are three basic modes of _l_i_n_e_s  operation:  _p_o_i_n_t
plotting where a symbol is displayed at each geographic
coordinate, _p_o_s_t_i_n_g where one or more  fields  of  data
from  the  data  record  are  printed at the geographic
point and _l_i_n_e drafting between  data  points.   Conse-
quently,  several  options  require either an s, c or l
prefix to denote whether  the  option  applies  to  the
respective  point, posting, or line control.  For exam-
ple, -_s_f selects point font while -_s_c selects the post-
ing  font.  Line drafting has three methods of display:
solid lines, dashed lines  and  symbol  lines.   Symbol
lines  are  similar  to  dashed  lines  except that the
graphic employed in lieu of the dash segment may be any
character(s)  from the symbol character font.  The sym-
bol line form may be combined with either the solid  or
dashed  line  option.   The  font  selected  by the -_s_f
(select symbol font) determines the character set  used
by  the  the  symbol line generator.  _S_t_r is any set of
one to 8 symbols selected  from  the  character  symbol
font  to be employed in a repeated manner when drafting
symbol lines.  A special symbol (\177) may be  employed

to  denote  an empty point in the symbol sequence.  Any
symbol (including the empty point symbol) with the most
significant  bit  (sign) set will cause 180 rotation of
the current and following _s_t_r (if any) symbols.  At the
start  of  each cycle through _s_t_r the rotation rotation
is set to 0 so that if a line is progressing from  left
to  right  the symbol would appear right side up.  If a
single symbol is to appear in  a  reverse  manner  then
\200  should be added (i.e. a reverse rotation letter A
would be \301).  To create a sequence of  symbols  with
alternating  rotation  then two or more symbols must be
used with the sign set on some symbol  other  than  the
first.   For  example, -a A\301 will cause the letter A
to be  plotted  with  alternating  rotation.   -_B  This
starts  line  drafting  in  a  manner similar to the -_l
option except that the following data coordinates  con-
tain  intermediate Bezier points that will cause smooth
line interpolation.  Bezier option must be  respecified
whenever  line  drafting  is suspended by a -_l_q option.
This option provides for the generation of rhumb  lines
(lines of constant azimuth) when _n is a positive value.
The larger the value of _n the  coarser  the  rhumb  fit
will  be  and the greater likelyhood of visible straigh
line segments.  Generally a selection of  -_R3  is  con-
sidered and optimal value for publication work.  When _n
zero or absent normal lines directly connecting coordi-
nates are employed.  When employed with non-rhumb lines
in a single control-data file a -_b should separate line
segments.   This  option specifies a break in the line.
Line drafting will be discontinued at  the  last  point
and  restarted  at the next data point.  When -_c occurs
as a  solitary  option,  the  subsequent  data  posting
fields  are  to  be  plotted.   This option selects the
point symbol to be employed.  If _a_r_g is a numeric value
then  it  is the numeric selection of the symbol other-
wise the ascii value.  _F_l_o_n and _f_l_a_t are the respective
field  control words of the longitude and latitude data
fields (data must be in DMS format).  Both  field  con-
trol words are of the form [_f][.[_o][._l]] where _f is the
field number, _o is the number  of  characters  to  skip
from the beginning of the field, and _l is the length of
the field.  If _l  is  not  specified  or  0,  then  the
remainder  of  the  field  is  employed.  If _f or _o are
omitted then 1 and 0 are  respective  assumptions.   If
this option is omitted then a default value of "-d 2,1"
is assumed.  The list of field control words  following
this  option defines the data fields to be posted.  The
format of _f_f is the same as for the  -_d  option.   This
option  selects dashed mode for line drafting.  _N_a_m_e is
the name of a graphic system font to  be  employed  for
the  point  (s) or posting (c) operations.  _C_h_r selects
justification mode for posting data: c for centered,  l
for  left  and  r  for right.  Default justification is
left.  Note that _c is currently required.  _D_i_s_t is  the

interval  (in  cm.)  between symbols during symbol line
mode.  This option will select  drafting  of  a  symbol
line.   If the character (immediately following -_k is a
k then the line will be  drafted  without  a  solid  or
dashed  connection  otherwise  the letter l will select
line drafting.  Note that the -_l or  -_l_q  parameter  is
still  required  to control beginning and ending of the
line drafting operation regardless of mode.  The -_a,  -
_k_d  and  -_k_s options should be appropriately set before
this option.  To deselect this option use either the  -
_l_s  or  -_l_d  line mode parameters.  When -_l occurs as a
solitary option, then line plotting is to  commence  at
subsequent  data  values.   Set  the  interline spacing
(leading) to _n / 8 times the character  size.   If  not
specified  for  multiple  fields, the posting data will
overplot.  A typical value of 12  (1.5  times)  usually
works  well.   Turn  perform line drafting with a solid
line (default option).  _A_r_g is the value for  the  dash
line  mask.   It  is treated as a 16-bit quantity where
each on bit is a solid  segment  of  the  dashed  line.
Note  that  it  must be entered as a decimal, octal, or
hexadecimal value (e.g., 123,  0123  or  0x123  respec-
tively).  _N is the mechanical pen to be employed.  Dis-
continue point (s), posting (c) or  line  (l)  plotting
mode.   If  _a_n_g is a numeric value, it is is the number
of counterclockwise degrees  the  posted  data  (c)  or
point  symbol (s) is to be rotated about the geographic
point.  If _a_n_g is the letter o or  p,  then  the  point
symbol or posting is to be made respectively orthogonal
or parallel to the  track  of  data  points.   When  -_s
occurs  as a solitary option, then point plotting is to
commence at subsequent data values.  _S_i_z_e is the  nomi-
nal  size of the characters for point (s), posting (c),
or symbol line characters (k) or the dash line interval
(l)  in centimeters.  The character _c, immediately fol-
lowing  -_t,  delimits  data  fields  on  data   records
(default:  "t\t" (tab)).  Use of special characters may
require quote mark enclosure.  _C_m is the number of cen-
timeters  along the x-axis the beginning of the posting
string is to be offset from the  geographic  coordinate
location.   Note:  offset  is  made  prior to rotation.
Option similar to -_c_x except that it is used for offset
along  the y-axis.  The character _c immediately follow-
ing -_z will replace the normal # character  that  indi-
cate control line and comment.
