_s_z_o_o_m scale files[s] and/or [program plotter options]

_S_z_o_o_m provides a convenient method for viewing  one  or
more  or  overlay  files on a Sun 3 or 4 color or mono-
chrome terminal where the graphic is to  be  scaled  to
the  full  size  of the Sunview window or normal screen
and allows the user to selectively  replot  sub-regions
of  the  display  for closer examination.  In addition,
elementary digitizing and creation of  a  control  file
compatible  with _l_e_g_e_n_d and _p_l_e_g_e_n_d.  is provided.  The
first item after _s_z_o_o_m on the run line must be either a
map  definition  file  or  a PLOTGEN scaling definition
file and there should be at  least  one  overlay  file.
These  remaining files or options are treated as normal
runline arguments to program _p_l_o_t_t_e_r.  _S_z_o_o_m employs  a
log file _s_z_o_o_m._t_e_x_t in the current working directory to
record information generated by  some  of  the  options
described  later.   Each  time  the  graphic section is
redrafted the contents of the log file are processed by
[p]legend  to  produce  an  overlay  file _s_z_o_o_m._t_e_x_t._o_v
which is  included  as  part  of  the  redrafting.   If
_s_z_o_o_m._t_e_x_t  does  not  exist  it  will be created and a
default startup control line  is  entered.   Otherwise,
subsequent entries are appended to the current contents
and the current contents will be part  of  the  initial
graphic.   It  is  general  practice  to  move  or copy
_s_z_o_o_m._t_e_x_t to another file after a  work  session  with
_s_z_o_o_m.  _S_z_o_o_m is menu driven with the options listed at
the left of the main graphic area.   Selection  of  the
option  is  made  by means centering the fist finger on
the menu item desired and clicking the  lefthand  mouse
button.  The following is a summary of currently avail-
able options: _E_x_i_t
Exit from _s_z_o_o_m.  _Z_o_o_m
This option allows the user to select  an  area  to  be
expanded  on  the  screen.  After selecting this option
position the fist to point to one corner of the area of
intest  and  click the left-hand button.  Repositioning
the fist will show a rectangular box  with  one  corner
anchored at the first position.  After locating the box
to cover the area of interest reclick the  left  button
(the  operation  may be cancelled by pressing the right
button).  This area will be replotted and displayed  as
a full screen region.  _d_e_Z_o_o_m
Zoom levels are remembered and the user may  return  to
the previous level by selecting this option.  _H_o_m_e
This option returns to the original full plot  scaling.
_P_a_n
If the screen is in zoom mode the plot may be panned by
positioning  the  fist  at a current location, clicking

the left button and selecting a  new  position  on  the
screen  where the first one should be moved to in order
to define the pan.  Clicking the left  button  at  this
new position starts the pan operation.  _L_i_n_e
This option provides for digitizing a series of vectors
whose  coordinates  are  recorded  in  the  log file by
clicking the left button at each of the nodes selected.
The  operation is discontinued when the right button is
clicked.  _P_o_l_y
_P_o_l_y is the same as _L_i_n_e except that the when  drafting
is  discontinued  (right button click) a closure vector
to the first point is made (thus a poly-line).  _T_e_x_t
Clicking the left button at the desired  position  will
record  the  coordinates in the log file and prompt the
user for text at the bottom of the  screen.   The  text
entered  is  also recorded in the log file until a line
beginning with a period is entered.  < _T_e_x_t
An option similar to _T_e_x_t except that a second position
must  be  clicked  which will define the angle at which
the text is to be rotated.  _M_a_r_k
Clicking the left cursor button at  a  select  position
will  cause  a -xy coordinate pair to be entered in the
log.  A permanent graphic  operation  is  not  directly
associated with this option.  _c_t_l _t_e_x_t
The user is prompted to enter text at the bottom of the
screen  which will be recorded in the log file.  A null
line terminates the option.  This is useful when it  is
desirable to change or add [_p]_l_e_g_e_n_d options.  _R_e_P_l_t
An occasionally useful operation which forces  redraft-
ing of the screen from the overlays and log file.
