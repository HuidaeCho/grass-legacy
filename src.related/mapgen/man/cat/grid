_G_r_i_d provides a mechanism for  producing  a  coordinate
grid  overlay  for  _m_a_p_g_e_n maps.  Most of the following
options can appear in any order: This option  specifies
the  required  map definition file.  If the -_m is omit-
ted, _d_e_f__f_i_l_e must be  the  first  file  listed.   This
option specifies the map overlay meta-graphic file.  If
this option is specified, a plot of the coastline  file
is  output  to the controlling terminal.  It the option
is omitted, then is implied.  One or  more  _f_i_l_e_s  con-
taining  control and graphic operations associated with
the grid overlay.

The following options provide for graphic  control  and
may  only  appear  in  the  control file[s].  Note that
several of the commands must have either a _m for  meri-
dian  or _p for parallel prefix to denote the respective
axis to  which  the  subsequent  option  applies.   The
decimal  value  of _n specifies the distance in centime-
ters that the label is to be offset from the  beginning
or  end  of the axis line.  _S_i_z_e is the nominal size of
the character set selected in centimeters.  _F_o_n_t speci-
fies  an alternate _g_r_a_p_h_i_c_s system font to be employed.
Note that the _g_r_a_p_h_i_c_s system default standard font  is
employed  to ensure presence of special symbols.  _S_i_d_e_s
may be a sequence of letters l, r, b or  t  which  flag
respective  left, right, bottom or top edges of the map
grid to be annotated.  If omitted, all edges are  anno-
tated  (same  as "-a lrbt").  If _s_i_d_e_s contains any set
of letters not in the above  set,  then  annotation  is
suppressed (i.e., "-a n").  Note that the relative edge
denotation is based on an  unrotated  geographic  axis.
The  _d_m_s  value  is the interval of the major grid ele-
ments in _D_M_S format.  _N is the number of  minor  inter-
vals  defined by tick marks to be evenly distributed in
the major grid interval.  A value of <=  1  or  omitted
(default)  denotes  no  minor interval.  If ticked mode
selected _u sets the size of the  major  tick  marks  in
centimeters.   If  omitted, then solid lines generated.
Similar to _u option except applies to minor ticks.   If
omitted, minor ticks not generated.  Selects mechanical
pen _n for grid drafting.  Selects mechanical pen _n  for
character   drafting.   If  not  selected  then  -_b  is
employed if selected.
