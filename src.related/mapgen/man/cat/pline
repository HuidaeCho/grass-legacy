_p_l_i_n_e [ -oi [args]] [ files ]

_P_l_i_n_e is a graphic function in the graphic series which
provides  for creating line, point and/or posting over-
lays from x-y coordinate data file[s].   The  following
run-line  options  can appear in any order: This option
specifies the map overlay meta-graphic file.   If  this
option  is  specified  a preview of the graphic file is
output to the controlling terminal.  If the  option  is
omitted,  then is implied.  One or more data _f_i_l_e_s that
contain x-y, posting and control data.  If no files are
specified,  or  if  a  - argument is encountered, _p_l_i_n_e
reads from the standard input.  Files are processed  in
left  to  right order.  The initial control information
in the input data stream must  be  scaling  options  as
defined  in  the  _p_l_t_g_e_n(_5) description.  The following
options provide for graphic  control  and  must  be  on
lines  with  a  #  character in column one.  A second #
character on these lines causes the  remainder  of  the
line  to  be ignored and, consequently, may be used for
comments.  There are three basic modes of _p_l_i_n_e  opera-
tion:  point  plotting  where  a symbol is displayed at
each x-y coordinate, posting where one or  more  fields
of  data  from  the  data record are printed at the x-y
point and line drafting between  data  points.   Conse-
quently,  several  options  require either an s, c or l
letter prefix to denote whether the option  applies  to
the  respective  point,  posting  or line control.  For
example -_s_f selects point font while  -_s_c  selects  the
posting  font.   Line  drafting  has  three  methods of
display: solid lines, dashed lines  and  symbol  lines.
Symbol  lines  are  similar to dashed lines except that
the graphic employed in lieu of the dash segment may be
any  character(s)  from the symbol character font.  The
symbol line form may be combined with either the  solid
or  dashed  line  option.  The font selected by the -_s_f
(select symbol font) determines the character set  used
by  the  the  symbol line generator.  _S_t_r is any set of
one to 8 symbols selected  from  the  character  symbol
font  to be employed in a repeated manner when drafting
symbol lines.  A special symbol (\177) may be  employed
to  denote  an empty point in the symbol sequence.  Any
symbol (including the empty point symbol) with the most
significant  bit  (sign) set will cause 180 rotation of
the current and following _s_t_r (if any) symbols.  At the
start  of  each cycle through _s_t_r the rotation rotation
is set to 0 so that if a line is progressing from  left
to  right  the symbol would appear right side up.  If a
single symbol is to appear in  a  reverse  manner  then
\200  should be added (i.e. a reverse rotation letter A
would be \301).  To create a sequence of  symbols  with

                         - 2 -


alternating  rotation  then two or more symbols must be
used with the sign set on some symbol  other  than  the
first.   For  example, -a A\301 will cause the letter A
to be  plotted  with  alternating  rotation.   -_B  This
starts  line  drafting  in  a  manner similar to the -_l
option except that the following data coordinates  con-
tain  intermediate Bezier points that will cause smooth
line interpolation.  Bezier option must be  respecified
whenever  line  drafting  is suspended by a -_l_q option.
This option specifies a break in the line.  Line draft-
ing  will  be  discontinued  at the last point and res-
tarted at the next data point.  When  -_c  occurs  as  a
solitary  option the subsequent data posting fields are
to be plotted.  This option selects the point symbol to
be  employed.  If _a_r_g is a numeric value then it is the
numeric selection of the  symbol  otherwise  the  ascii
value.   _F_x  and  _f_y  are  the respective field control
words of the x-axis and y-axis data fields.  Both field
control  words are of the form [_f][.[_o][._l]] where _f is
the field number, _o is the number of characters to skip
from the beginning of the field, and _l is the length of
the field.  If _l is not specified or 0, then the entire
field  is employed.  If _f or _o are omitted then 1 and 0
are respective assumptions.  If this option is  omitted
then  a  default of is assumed.  The list of field con-
trol words  following  this  option  defines  the  data
fields  to  be posted.  The format of _f_f is the same as
for the -_d option.  This option selects dashed mode for
line  drafting.   _N_a_m_e  is the name of a graphic system
font to be employed for the point (s)  or  posting  (c)
operations.  _C_h_r selects justification mode for posting
data: c for centered, l  for  left  and  r  for  right.
Default  justification  is  left.  _D_i_s_t is the interval
(in cm.) between symbols during symbol line mode.  This
option  will  select drafting of a symbol line.  If the
character (immediately following -_k is  a  k  then  the
line  will be drafted without a solid or dashed connec-
tion otherwise the letter l will select line  drafting.
Note  that the -_l or -_l_q parameter is still required to
control beginning  and  ending  of  the  line  drafting
operation  regardless  of  mode.   The  -_a, -_k_d and -_k_s
options should be appropriately set before this option.
To  deselect this option use either the -_l_s or -_l_d line
mode parameters.  When -_l occurs as a  solitary  option
then  line  plotting  is to commence at subsequent data
values.  Set the interline spacing (leading) to _n  /  8
times  the character size.  If not specified for multi-
ple fields, the posting data will overplot.  A  typical
value  of 12 (1.5 times) usually works well.  Turn per-
form line drafting with a solid line (default  option).
_A_r_g is the value for the dash line mask.  It is treated
as a 16 bit quantity where each on bit is a solid  seg-
ment  of the dashed line.  Note that it must be entered
as a decimal, octal or hexadecimal value (123, 0123  or

0x123  respectively).   _N  is  the mechanical pen to be
employed.  Discontinue point (s), posting (c)  or  line
(l)  plotting mode.  If _a_n_g is a numeric value it is is
the number of counter clockwise degrees the posted data
(c)  or point symbol (s) is to be rotated about the x-y
point.  If _a_n_g is the letter o or p then the point sym-
bol or posting is to be made respectively orthogonal or
parallel to the track of data points.  When  -_s  occurs
as a solitary option then point plotting is to commence
at subsequent data values.  _S_i_z_e is the nominal size of
the  characters  for  point (s), posting (c), or symbol
line characters (k) or the dash line  interval  (l)  in
centimeters.  The character _c, immediately following t,
delimits data fields on data records (default:  (tab)).
Use  of  special characters may require quoting.  _C_m is
the number of centimeters along the x-axis  the  begin-
ning of the posting string is to be offset from the x-y
coordinate location.  Note: offset  is  made  prior  to
rotation.   Option  similar  to  except that for offset
along the y-axis.  The character _c_h_r will  replace  the
normal # character indicating control line and comment.
