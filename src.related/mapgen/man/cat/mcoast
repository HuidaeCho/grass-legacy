_M_c_o_a_s_t is required to create the data files employed by
the  program  _C_o_a_s_t.   Input data defining the nodes of
coastline segments must be in  the  following  form:  a
record  beginning  with  a # character and feature code
number (between 0 and 255)  followed  by  one  or  more
records containing a single pair of latitude and longi-
tude values (separated by white space) which define the
nodes  of  the  line.  The processing of the first line
segment is not begun until the first # record  is  pro-
cessed.   Error monitoring is provided on standard out-
put.  The above data is compressed and placed into  two
files: the *.cdr file contains the lon-lat range of the
line data segments as well as  pointer  information  to
the  *.cdt  file  which  contains the definition of the
line  in  incremental  form.   The  following  run-line
parameters can appear in any order: This optional value
of _n establishes the resolution  of  the  data  set  in
"meters on the ground".  _F_i_l_e is required and specifies
the name of the compressed data set "file.cdt" and  its
associated  directory "file.cdr".  This option reverses
the order of the input data pair from latitude - longi-
tude to longitude - latitude.  This option provides for
the input to be  in  quasi-binary  form  where  segment
headers must consist of "# code length" and coordinates
are latitude-longitude in double precision binary.  The
-_R  options  has no effect with -_b option.  One or more
_f_i_l_e_s of source data may be specified and are processed
in  a  left to right order.  If a _f_i_l_e is not specified
_s_t_a_n_d_a_r_dinput is assumed.  A -  may  also  signify  the
point of processing _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_dinput.

_A _s_o_u_r_c_e _f_i_l_e, _m_y_d_a_t_a is to be preprocessed by the pro-
gram  _a_b_c to reformat the data into a form suitable for
_m_c_o_a_s_t input.  _M_c_o_a_s_t is to create a coastline file set
_m_y_c_o_a_s_t which has a resolution of 200 meters.

The file _m_o_n_i_t_o_r is  used  to  collect  any  processing
information from _m_c_o_a_s_t so that the process can be han-
dled in batch mode.   Compressed  coastline  data  file
created will be named _m_y_c_o_a_s_t._c_d_r and _m_y_c_o_a_s_t._c_d_t.
