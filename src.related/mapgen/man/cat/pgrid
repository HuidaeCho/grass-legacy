_P_g_r_i_d is a graphic  function  in  the  _P_L_O_T_G_E_N  graphic
series  which  provides for creating an overlay of axis
grid.  The following run-line options can appear in any
order:
This option  specifies  the  map  overlay  meta-graphic
file.
If this option is specified a preview  of  the  graphic
file  is output to the controlling terminal.  It the -_o
option is omitted, then -_i is  implied.   One  or  more
data  _f_i_l_e_s that contain x-y, posting and control data.
If no files are  specified,  or  if  a  -  argument  is
encountered,  _p_p_o_i_n_t  reads  from  the  standard input.
Files are processed in left to right order.   The  ini-
tial  control information in the input data stream must
be scaling options as defined in the _p_l_t_g_e_n(_5) descrip-
tion.  The following options provide for graphic opera-
tions:
_F_o_n_t is the name of the graphics system  character  set
font  to  be employed in subsequent character plotting.
A - will select the system default font.   This  option
and  -_s  must be selected prior to any character opera-
tions.
_S_i_z_e is the nominal size of the character set  selected
in centimeters.
The approximate interval of tick marks in  centimeters.
The  system  determines  the data values to be employed
based on this factor.  This option not  applicable  for
logarithmic axis.
If the value of _n is 1 or 3 the lower (x axis) or  left
(y  axis)  will be annotated with tick marks and 2 or 3
the top or right edge will be ticked.   Default  values
for both axis are 3.
Similar to the 't' option except that _n controls label-
ing.  Default values for both axis are 1.
_S_t_r is a C language _p_r_i_n_t_f format  specifier  for  real
numbers  (ie. %e, %g or %f).  The default for both axis
is %12.2g.  For logarithmic axis annotation only the %g
or %e forms are normally applicable.
_P_e_n is a mechanical pen number to be employed.
