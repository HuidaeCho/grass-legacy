_P_r_e_v_i_e_w provides a convenient method for viewing one or
more _M_A_P_G_E_N or _P_L_O_T_G_E_N overlay files on the host termi-
nal or other devices for which the  graphic  is  to  be
scaled  to  the full size of the device.  The _z_o_o_m ver-
sion allows the user to selectively replot  sub-regions
of  the  display  for closer examination.  In addition,
_z_o_o_m provides for elementary digitizing and creation of
control  files compatible with _l_e_g_e_n_d and _p_l_e_g_e_n_d.  The
following options must appear in order indicated:
Any of the program _p_l_o_t_t_e_r options may be specified.
This  option  specifies  the  scaling  definition  file
employed  by  the other _P_L_O_T_G_E_N or _M_A_P_G_E_N graphic func-
tions when creating the set of overlays to be  plotted.
The  usage  of  the  -_m  is  only required when plotter
options are specified.  _f_i_l_e_s[_s]
One or more overlay files generated by  the  _M_A_P_G_E_N  or
_P_L_O_T_G_E_N system employing the specified definition file.
When the cursor first appears on the screen when  using
_z_o_o_m the user has seven control options (_q, _h, _p, _d, _a,
and _l) selected by typing a single key: _q to  quit  the
execution  of  _z_o_o_m  and  return  to  the system.  _h to
redisplay the initial plot.  _p to redisplay the  previ-
ous level of zoom.  _s_p_a_c_ebar
initiates either zoom or pan operations.

     When the using the zoom or  enlargement  operation
     the space bar should be struck after the cursor is
     positioned  at  one  corner  of  the  area  to  be
     expanded.   A cross will be drafted at this corner
     and the cursor will reappear.   After  moving  the
     cursor to the opposite corner of the selected win-
     dow the space character should  be  reentered.   A
     second cross at this location will be made and the
     system will wait for a <CR> before continuing with
     redrafting  the  selected  window.   Note that the
     region selected must have some area (not  a  line)
     otherwise  the cursor will reappear and the second
     cursor entry operation ignored.

     For panning or shifting the plot without rescaling
     the  size  the  cursor should be positioned on the
     screen at the point which is to be moved to a  new
     position  designated  by  the  next  cursor entry.
     After space character is entered a cross is  anno-
     tated  and  the  cursor reappears.  The cursor now
     should be moved to the new position on the  screen
     where  the first point is to be shifted and a _n_o_n-

     _b_l_a_n_k character entered.  Remaining action is  the
     same as for the zoom operation.

     In the panning operations, stacking  of  the  plot
     levels  may  be  bypassed by entering a 0 (numeric
     zero) as the non-blank character  for  the  second
     cursor  position.   _d key will cause the digitized
     value at the cursor position to be written out  in
     _l_e_g_e_n_d/_p_l_e_g_e_n_d  compatible  form.   When either of
     the _d,a, or _l keys are first activated  _z_o_o_m  will
     prompt  for the name of the file for the digitized
     information.  In addition, the user may enter text
     information after the coordinates of the digitized
     point.  _a key acts in a similar manner  to  the  _d
     key except that the cursor reappears after a cross
     is drawn so the user may determine  an  angle  for
     orientation of the following text.  The angle com-
     puted is determined  by the azimuth from the  ini-
     tial  point  to the new crosshair position.  _l key
     indicates the beginning point of  line  coordinate
     data.  The cursor will reappear and for each space
     key entry a new coordinate will be determined.  In
     addition,  the  line  information will be drawn on
     the screen as each point is entered.  Line  draft-
     ing  is  terminated  by  a  non-space  key  entry.
     Striking an invalid key will cause the  terminal's
     bell to ring and no action will be taken.
