_P_o_i_n_t_s is a graphic  function  in  the  MAPGEN  graphic
series which provides for creating point and/or posting
map overlays from geographic coordinate  data  file[s].
Most  of the following options can appear in any order:
This option specifies the required map definition file.
If  the  -_m is omitted, _d_e_f__f_i_l_e must be the first file
listed.  This option specifies the  map  overlay  meta-
graphic  file.   If this option is specified, a plot of
the graphic file is output to the controlling terminal.
It  the -_o option is omitted, then -_i is implied.  This
options provides  for  run-line  inclusion  of  graphic
options listed below.  If there is more than one option
or imbedded blanks,  the  field  must  be  enclosed  in
quotes  or  apostrophies.   One or more data _f_i_l_e_s that
contain geographic, posting, and control data.   If  no
files are specified, or if a - argument is encountered,
_p_o_i_n_t_s reads from the standard input.  Files  are  pro-
cessed  in  left to right order.  The following options
provide for graphic control and may only appear in  the
-_c run-line field or the data file(s).  Control data in
the data files must be on lines with a #  character  in
column one.  A second # character on these lines causes
the remainder of the line  to  be  ignore  and,  conse-
quently, may be used for comments.  There are two basic
modes of _p_o_i_n_t_s operation: _p_o_i_n_t plotting, where a sym-
bol  is  displayed  at  each geographic coordinate; and
_p_o_s_t_i_n_g, where one or more fields of data from the data
record  are  printed  at  the geographic point.  Conse-
quently, several options require either an s or c  pre-
fix to denote whether the option applies to the respec-
tive  point  or  posting  control.   For  example,  -_s_f
selects  point  font  and -_s_c selects the posting font.
When -_c occurs as a  solitary  option,  the  subsequent
data  posting  fields  are  to be plotted.  This option
selects the point symbol to be employed.  If _a_r_g  is  a
numeric  value,  then  the  symbol  is  selected by the
numeric value of the symbol, otherwise the ascii  char-
acter.   _F_l_o_n and _f_l_a_t are the respective field control
words of the longitude and latitude data  fields  (data
must  be  in DMS format).  Both field control words are
of the form [_f][.[_o][._l]] where _f is the field  number,
_o  is  the number of characters to skip from the begin-
ning of the field, and _l is the length  of  the  field.
If  _l  is not specified or 0, then the remainder of the
field is employed.  If _f or _o are omitted, then 1 and 0
are respective assumptions.  If this option is omitted,
then a default of "-d 2,1" is  assumed.   The  list  of
field  control  words following this option defines the
data fields to be posted.  The format of _f_f is the same

as  for  the  -_d option.  _N_a_m_e is the name of a graphic
system font to be employed for the point (s) or posting
(c)  operations.   _C_h_r  selects  justification mode for
posting data: c for centered, l  for  left  and  r  for
right.   Default justification is left.  Set the inter-
line spacing (leading) to _n /  8  times  the  character
size.   If not specified for multiple fields, the post-
ing data will overplot.  A typical  value  of  12  (1.5
times) usually works well.
_N is the mechanical pen to  be  employed.   Discontinue
point  (s)  or  posting (c) mode.  _A_n_g is the number of
counter clockwise degrees the posted data (c) or  point
symbol (s) is to be rotated about the geographic point.
When -_s occurs as a solitary option, point plotting  is
to  commence  at  subsequent  data values.  _S_i_z_e is the
nominal size of the point (s) or posting (c) characters
in centimeters.  The character _c, immediately following
-_t delimits data fields on data records (default: -_t_\^_I
(tab)).   _C_m  is the number of centimeters along the x-
axis the beginning of  the  posting  string  is  to  be
offset  from the geographic coordinate location.  Note:
offset is made prior to rotation.   Option  similar  to
-_c_x except that it is used for offset along the y-axis.
The character _c immediately following -_z  will  replace
the  normal # character for indicating control line and
comment.
