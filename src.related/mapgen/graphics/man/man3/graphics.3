.SH DESCRIPTION
The information presented here is only a brief synopsis  and
syntax of entry points of the
device independent graphics system.

.I Plotopen
and/or
.I defopen
are necessary to initialize the graphics system.
.I Plotopen
establishes a bidirectional link with program
.B plotter
for direct output of graphics to a particular device.
Note that the first and second pointers in the list
.I argl
are ignored and the last element must be a null pointer (0).
When interactively linking to
.B plotter
one adjacent pair of the arguments must contain '"-i","."' which will
indicate the point of pipe linkage with
.B plotter.
Other arguments may contain other arguments associated
with
.B plotter
execution.
If
.I plotopen
is employed interactively the graphics operations
should be terminated by a call to
.I plotend.

.I Defopen
establishes an output file
which collects all meta-graphics generated by subsequent
graphic calls.
.I Defclose
terminates output of data to the file established by
.I defopen.

Note that both
.I plotend
and 
.I plotclose
will flush current contents of output buffers.

.I Pxyxmit
transmits pen x and y coordinates to the meta-graphic stream.
Principally
.I cmd
is used to designate the status of the "pen" during motion
from the last position to the current coordinates.
It also may indicate that the current values of x and y
are relative to a previous absolute position.

.I Plotopt
entry is used to transmit a wide variety of options,
attributes and control to the meta-graphic stream.

If the process has been linked to
.B plotter
via a
.I plotopen
call, status, cursor position as well as other information
can be retrieved with execution of
.I plotreq.
The results of the inquiry are returned as elements of the
structure pointed to by
.I plotreq.
