.SH NAME
plotter - plotting of metagraphic stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B plotter
[ -diorspxyXYPD [args] ] [ file(s) ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Plotter
interprets a metagraphic stream and reformats the data
into a form acceptable by the selected graphics device.

Except for the
.B \-p
and
.B \-x
options the following command line control parameters can appear in any order:
.TP
.BI \-d " name"
.br
.I Name
defines the name of the plotting device to which the output
is to be directed.
If
.I name
is omitted,
.B plotter
acquires the name of the device from the
.B GTERM
entry of the processes' environment or the
.B TERM
entry if
.B GTERM
is not specified.
If
.I name
or the default terminal is not an implemented device,
.B plotter
proceeds with a dummy device and does not produce output.
.TP
.BI \-s " scale"
.br
.I Scale
must be a floating point value which will scale the coordinate
values of the input metagraphic stream.
.TP
.BI \-o " output"
.br
This option directs the device dependent graphic control data to file
.I output.
If not specified the data will be sent to the output file
specified by the GRAPHB environment option or to
.I stdout
if it is also not specified.
.TP
.BI \-i " m.n"
.br
This option only applies to the interactive use of
.B plotter
by programs using a bidirection link.
It should not be employed by
.I shell
execution of
.B plotter.
.I M.n
are automatically generated by graphics library software.
.I M
is the file descriptor for the input metagraphic data pipe to
.B plotter
and
.I n
is the file descriptor of the return data pipe to the calling
program.
.TP
.BI \-q
.br
This option alerts interactive display drivers not to sound
console bell and wait for a <CR> at the end of a plot.
Its primary purpose is with cursor control applications which
hold the screen with cursor input and where plot termination
is at user's cursor input control.
.TP
.BI \-r
.br
If this option is selected, the x and y axis are reversed on
the plotting device.
.TP
.BI \-[p|P] "m:n[,m:n]"
.br
Mapping the mechanical pens selected in the original
overlay files to new mechanical pens may be performed by use of
this option.
The
.B \-p
option is sensitive to its position on the run line
and only affects overlay files that follow its specification.
It may be employed on the run-line as often as meaningful.
.IP
The argument pair
.I m:n
(immediately following the
.B \-p
or
.B \-P
)
consists of the original mechanical pen number
.I m
and the new mechanical pen number
.I n
to be employed in this plot.
.I M
may also denote a range of original mechanical pen numbers when a \-
is employed.
For example: 3\-6:0 maps original values 3 through 6 to new pen 0,
0\-3:5 or \-3:5 maps pens 0 through 3 to new pen 5, and
3\-:2 maps pens 3 through 255 to pen 2.
.IP
The
.B \-P
option applies the pen mapping to all input files and it
may appear anywhere on the runline.
.TP
.BI \-[X|Y|x|y] n
This option provides for shifting the overlay by
.I n
overlay coordinate units in the x and/or y axis.
The options
.B \-X
and
.B \-Y
define an offset for all overlays while the
.B \-x
and
.B \-y
options create offsets relative to 0,0 or origin modified by
.B \-XY
only for the overlays that follow on
the run-line.
.IP
Offset units depend upon application software generating the
overlay files and the units expected by the plot device.
For hardcopy devices
this is typically 200 counts/cm so that creating
a 10 cm offset in the x axis would require a value for
.I n
of 10\(mu200 counts or \-x2000.
.TP
.BI \-Dstring
.br
.I String
is information passed to the selected device driver.
Reference to specific driver documentation must be made for details
of content.
.TP
.BI file(s)
.br
The files named contain metagraphic commands compatible
with this system (see Device Independent Vector Graphics manual).
The files are processed in a left to right order.
A \- may be used once to designate input from
.I stdin.
If no files are given and option
.B \-i
is not employed,
.I stdin
is assumed to be the source of the metagraphic stream.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.P
.B Plotter
requires the environment entry
.B GRAPHB
which is also employed by application software employing this
graphics system.
The general
.B csh
method of initializing this environment parameter is:
.RS 0
.sp
\f(CWsetenv GRAPHB prog_path:fonts_path:def_font[:dev,file]:\fR
.sp
.RE
where
.I prog_path
is the full path name of program
.B plotter,
.I fonts_path
is the directory containing the font definition data, and
.I def_font
is the default font name in
.I fonts_path
employed when only a \- font name is used.
.I Dev,file
is an optional list of plotting devices and their output file name.
Note that each plotter entry must be separated by a : and
associated file delimited with a ,.
The following is an example entry:
.RS 0
.sp
.nf
\f(CWsetenv GRAPHB /graph/plotter:/graph/fonts/:sr:kong,/dev/ttym2:\fR
.fi
.RE
.SH EXAMPLE
\f(CWplotter file1 file2 -s 4\fR
.sp
will generate a composite plot of both files on the user's terminal
and will have the coordinates scaled by a factor of 4.
.sp
\f(CWplotter file1 -p1:0 file2 -s .25 -d calcomp -o caltemp\fR
.sp
will scale the meta-graphic files by 1/4 and output the 
.I calcomp
plotter control to the disc file
.I caltemp.
The mechanical pen 1 of metagraphic
.I file2
is mapped to pen 0;

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If an invalid graphics device is selected, a message is
output to
.I stderr
and all input data are ignored.
Additional error conditions are available only though
bidirectional linkage with controlling process.
