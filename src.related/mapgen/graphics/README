  ----------------------- Version 4 ----------------------------

This directory system contains the device independent vector graphic
system used by MAPGEN/PLOTGEN.

All generation of programs or scripts is provided by standard UNIX
System V.2+ make files or Bourne (or Korn) shell scripts in files
with names [Mm]ake*.  The installer should examine "install" and,
if necessary,  adjust 'tunable' parameters for local system.

NOTE ULTRIX systems: use /usr/sh5 shell for installation.  DEC's
	default sh is woefully out of date.

NOTE: external pre-version 4.x drivers are not compatible with
	version 4.

The installer should also edit the file ./plotter/devlist.c to select
the device drivers to be included in program 'plotter'.  This is done
by moving the initialization lines before or after the conditional
compile statement #if 0.  The installer may also wish to change local
identification of the particular driver by altering the string within
the quotes.  It is a good idea to create a backup copy before per-
forming this operation.

The installation script "install" may be employed to generate all of
the programs and support files in this system.  If the installer has
device independent troff and wishes to install this feature then the
directory /usr/lib/font/devGRAPH must be created and made writable
by the installer.  Local version of the UNIX program makedev must
also be available in the search path of the installer.  If the troff
feature is not desired, error messages generated by the "install"
procedure can be ignored.

"install" also creates the files sh_env and csh_env which may be
'source'd or '.'.  Typically, these are commands are placed in
user's '.profile' or '.login' files.
