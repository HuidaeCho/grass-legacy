# log	(math lib) : Microport System V/AT 2.2, error .75 <= arg < 1.
# strtol (libc) : ANSI routine missing from BSD
# strtod (libc) : ANSI routine missing from BSD
# fmod	(math lib (?)) : ANSI routine missing from BSD
# tempnam : version V emmulation for BSD (can't find any equivalencies
#		for this operation in BSD)

#RANLIB = ranlib
RANLIB = echo

# installer should check each individual subsystem Makefile for
# requirements of this library.
