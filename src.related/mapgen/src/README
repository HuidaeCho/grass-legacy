The map/plot-gen system consists of several basic subdivisions:
	device independent graphics under ./graphics
	cartographic projections, under ./proj
	mapgen system, under ./mapgen
	plotgen system, under ./plotgen
	supplementary library support, under ./lib
	complete xx.1 documentation sources, under ./man

All generation of programs or scripts is provided by standard UNIX
System V.2+ make files or Bourne (or Korn) shell scripts in files
with names [Mm]ake*.  These procedures expect that the
GRAPH and RANLIB environment parameters are appropriately set.
In all cases, executables are placed in the directory $GRAPH/bin and
supplementary support files are placed in $GRAPH/lib when employing
the 'install' option.  Once the system is installed and tested it
may be relocated to alternate 'bin's' and 'lib's'.

Before installation the installer should edit the file
graphics/plotter/devlist.c to select the supported devices to be
included in program plotter.  This is done by moving the initialization
lines before or after the conditional compile statement #ifdef IGNORE.
The installer may also wish to change local identification of the
particular driver by altering the string within the quotes.  It is
a good idea to create a backup copy before performing this operation.

The installation script INSTALL may be employed to generate all of
the programs and support files in the map/plot-gen system.  If the
installer has device independent troff and wishes to install this
feature then the directory /usr/lib/font/devGRAPH must be created
and made writable by the installer.  Local version of the UNIX program
makedev must also be available in the search path of the installer.
If the troff feature is not desired, error messages generated
by the INSTALL procedure can be ignored.

INSTALL also creates the files sh_locenv and csh_locenv which may
be 'sourced' by the user after generation to alter environment so
that the new system may be tested without disturbing existing
older versions.  A third file is created by INSTALL, install.mon,
which lists the error status of each section as they are created.

############## add for GRASS interface mlh ####################
If the GRASS variable is set in the INSTALL script an attemt will be
made to install the GRASS interface to MAPGEN. If this is done the
new version of the MAPGEN plotter program will talk directly to
the GRASS monitor selected by the user. Warning!!! the plot.sh
shell script in /usr/mapgen/macros will not work. Each installation
will have to determine the best way to interface with there device.
It may be necessary to modify code in the directory
mapgen/src/graphics/plotter.
