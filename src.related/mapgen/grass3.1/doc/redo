            redo executes all of the parameter files, for one or more            ____                                                     
            element directories, to create new graphic files for the ovm                                                                     ___

            EXAMPLE            EXAMPLE
            If the user created four extensive area fill layers for the
            map composition, and later wished to revise the plotting
            color on two layers, three steps would be required to make
            the change: 1 & 2) edit the parameter files to change the
            pen number, and save the changes; and 3) create new graphic
            files for the ovm directory to reflect the new pen colors.                          ___                                         
            
                 redo fills
            
            NOTE            NOTE
            The delete key will abort the redo command.                                          ____
