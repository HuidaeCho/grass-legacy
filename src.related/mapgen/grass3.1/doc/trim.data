            trim.data allows the user to trim the size of the data area            _________                                                  
            in a map composition by identifying a north, south, east and
            west point for a new data window.  The extremity points are
            identified by using the mouse device to point to the desired
            location on the graphic screen.
            
            This capability provides a graphic alternative for modifying
            the map definition parameters in the map.def.par file.                                                 ___________
