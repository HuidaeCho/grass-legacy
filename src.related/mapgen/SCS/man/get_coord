            SYNOPSIS
            get_coord
            
            DESCRIPTION
            get_coord allows the user to determine the location of a
            point in centimeter values in relation to the plot or data
            window.  The point is identified by using the mouse device
            to point to the location on the graphic screen.
            
            To leave the program, the user must select the point using
            the right button on the mouse device.
            
            EXAMPLE
            
                 get_coord
            
            NOTE
            Using the delete key will lock the graphic screen; the user
            will not be aware of this until the next command is issued.
            To unlock the screen, the user must click on any mouse
            button.
