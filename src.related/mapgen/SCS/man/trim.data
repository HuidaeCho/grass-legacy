            NAME
            trim.data - Enables the user to graphically trim the size of
            the data area in a map composition.
            
            SYNOPSIS
            trim.data 
            
            DESCRIPTION 
            trim.data allows the user to trim the size of the data area 
            in a map composition by identifying a north, south, east and
            west point for a new data window.  The extremity points are
            identified by using the mouse device to point to the desired
            location on the graphic screen.
            
            This capability provides a graphic alternative for modifying
            the map definition parameters in the map.def.par file. 
            
            EXAMPLE
            
                 trim.data
            
            NOTE 
            Before using the trim.data command, the user must have run
            the GRASS d.erase command, and then the d.vect command for a
            base vector file to use as a reference.
