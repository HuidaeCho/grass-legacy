SHELL SCRIPTS USED AS PART OF THE GRASS/MAPGEN INTERFACE

MAPGEN --       This shell script sets up the MAPGEN environment and places the user in the
                correct director for the map to be edited.

att.to.geo --   This shell script converts the GRASS dig_att file to a MAPGEN georeferenced
                sites file in the sites_geo directory. This command uses the MAPGEN
                program proj to do the coordinate conversion.

dig.to.geo --   This shell script converts the GRASS digit file to a MAPGEN georeferenced
                line file in the dig_geo directory. This command uses the MAPGEN
                program proj to do the coordinate conversion.

fill.dig --     This shell script reads a GRASS digit file and generates line work to fill
                user specified polygons with a fill pattern. This command uses fill_dig
                and the mapgen programs proj and lines.

fill_dig --     This program reads a GRASS digit file and generates line work to fill
                user specified polygons with a fill pattern. The output of this program is
                the line work in the GRASS coordinate system. This program should only be called
                by fill.dig.

init.def --     This shell script creates the parameters necessary to run the MAPGEN program
                mapdef. This script should only be called by make.mapdef.

make.box --     This shell script is used to place a box on the map using plot x,y
                coordinates in either inches or centimeters. This script calls the program
                make_box and the MAPGEN program legend.

make.bscale --  This shell script is used to place a bar scale on the map. The script calls
                the program make_bscale and the MAPGEN program legend.


make.label --   This shell script is used to place labels on the map using geographic
                coordinates and labels found in the sites_geo files. This script calls the
                MAPGEN program points.


make.leg --     This shell script is used to place a legend box on the map using plot x,y
                coordinates in either inches or centimeters. This script calls the program
                make_leg and the MAPGEN program legend.


make.line --    This shell script is used to place line work on the map using geographic
                coordinates. This script calls the MAPGEN program lines.


make.mapdef --  This shell script is used to generate the map definition file. This file
                controls the layout of the map and the transformation of geographic coordinates
                to the plot x,y coordinates. This script calls the script init.def and the
                MAPGEN program mapdef.


make.pattern -- This shell script is used to define a fill patter. This program can only be
                run by the GRASS system administrator. The files defining the fill pattern
                are located in the directory /usr/mapgen/etc/pattern. File distributed with
                the software have the naming convention aaa.sss. Where aaa is the line angle
                and sss is the spacing between lines in centimeters on the plot.


make.symbol --  This shell script is used to place symbols on the map using geographic
                coordinates found in the sites_geo files. This script calls the
                MAPGEN program points.


make.symleg --  This shell script is used to place a legend entry for symbols on the map
                using plot x,y coordinates in either inches or centimeters. This script calls
                the program make_symleg and the MAPGEN program legend. This program will probably
                be replaced with add functions in the mak.leg command in future version of
                the interface.

make.text --    This shell script is used to place text on the map using plot x,y
                coordinates in either inches or centimeters. This script calls the program
                make_text and the MAPGEN program legend.

neatline --     This shell script is used to place a neatline on the map using plot x,y
                coordinates in either inches or centimeters. This script calls the program
                make_box and the MAPGEN program legend.

north.arrow --  This shell script is used to place a north arrow on the map using plot x,y
                coordinates in either inches or centimeters. This script uses the MAPGEN program
                legend.

make.usbase --  This shell script is used to make the map definition file for a map of the whole
                United States. The script would be used instead of the make.mapdef command.

sites.to.geo -- This shell script converts the GRASS sites_list file to a MAPGEN georeferenced
                sites file in the sites_geo directory. This command uses the MAPGEN
                program proj to do the coordinate conversion.

SHELL SCRIPTS TO PROVIDE A REDO FACILITY TO THE GRASS/MAPGEN INTERFACE

redo --         This shell script allows the user to regenerate map overlay files. This function
                be used if the user changed some parameters in the map definition file or in the
                files associated with each of the interface programs. This script call the specific
                redo scripts listed below. It is recommended that the user use this script
                instead of trying to call each redo script individually.

redo.fill --    This shell script will recreate the overlay file for the specified fill pattern
                using the current information in the parameter file and the map definition file.

redo.label --   This shell script will recreate the overlay file for the specified label file
                using the current information in the parameter file and the map definition file.

redo.leg --     This shell script will recreate the overlay file for the specified legend box
                using the current information in the parameter file and the map definition file.

redo.line --    This shell script will recreate the overlay file for the specified line work
                using the current information in the parameter file and the map definition file.

redo.misc --    This shell script will recreate the overlay file for the specified overlay such
                as neatline, north arrow, etc.

                the specified overlay files on the desired plotter.

show.font --    This shell script is designed to display the availble text fonts to the user to
                assist in selecting fonts.

show.sh --      This shell script does the correct call to the MAPGEN preview routine to preview
                the specified overlay files on the screen. At present this command can not be used
                if the GRASS monitor is running.




U.S. Geological Survey's MAPGEN commands

grid --         Grid provides a mechanism to produce a geographic coordinate grid overlay for
                MAPGEN maps.

legend --       Legend is a graphic function which provides for creating overlays of text, symbols
                and lines on MAPGEN maps. This command uses the plot coordinate system in
                centimeters and is used for legends, scale bars, titles, etc..

lines --        Lines in a graphic function that provides for creating line, point, and/or posting
                overlays from geographic coordinate data.

mapdef --       Mapdef is used for creating or modifying the map definition file. This file defines
                the layout of the map and how the geographic coordinate system is placed.

points --       Points in a graphic function that provides for creating point, and/or posting
                overlays from geographic coordinate data.

plotter --      Plotter interprets metagraphic overlay files generated by MAPGEN programs and produces
                selected device specific commands to reproduce the overlays on the device.

preview --      Preview provides a convenient method for viewing select MAPGEN overlays on a selected
                device for which the graphic is to be scaled to the size of the device.
