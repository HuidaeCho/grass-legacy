            NAME
            copy.map - Makes a copy of an existing map under a new map
            name.
            
            SYNOPSIS
            copy.map [old_mapname]            copy.map              
            
            DESCRIPTION
            copy.map makes a copy of all files in an existing map to use
            as the active map.  The user must create the new map by
            providing a new map name (e.g. map2) following the MAPGEN
            command, then copy the contents of the old map into the new
            environment.
            
            EXAMPLE
            
                 copy.map map1
            
            NOTE
            Though more cumbersome, the UNIX cp command may be used to
            change the names on the individual appropriate files.
