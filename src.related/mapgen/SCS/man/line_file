NAME
MAPGEN sites file - Site file used by the GRASS/MAPGEN interface.

Discussion
The GRASS system records point information in a number of projection systems.
Because MAPGEN requires point information in the latitude/longitude geographic
coordinate system it was necessary to create a file structure to store GRASS
point information in Latitude/longitude.

The MAPGEN sites files reside in the sites_geo directory (see directory structure).
The programs att.to.geo, cat.to.geo and sites.to.geo will take GRASS attribute, category
or sites files and generate the MAPGEN sites file directly. The following format is
provide so that a user may provide non GRASS point data to the GRASS/MAPGEN interface.

The format is as follows:

LON (tab) LAT (tab) [LABEL]	#LABEL is an optional label the can be used by the
LON (tab) LAT (tab) [LABEL]	#make.label program

Note: The longitude and latitude numbers must be in degrees minutes and seconds
and must be separated by one tab character. The label is a collection of ASCII
characters with no tabs. The label must be separated from the latitude value
with exactly one tab character.
