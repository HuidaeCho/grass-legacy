NAME

dig_cats - FILE STRUCTURE for GRASS dig_cats files.

The present version of the GRASS/MAPGEN interface is capable of using the labels placed
in the dig_cats file associated with a GRASS digit file. The dig_cats file is used by the 
interface programs cat.to.geo and make.fill. To use this file for referencing area
labels it must follow a well defined structure.

For each category the line in the dig_cats file must be as follows:
	cat#:name:name2:[anything else]

Where name and name2 are the names that can be used in the make.fill and cat.to.geo programs.
When used the labels in the dig_cat file must exactly match what the user specifies.


Example
	: 10 categories				#line one
	Farmfields categories

	0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00
	0:NO DATA:				#line five
	1:C. Smith:
	2:C. Smith:
	3:P. Biggam:
	4:P. Biggam:
	5:P. Biggam:
	6:P. Biggam:
	7:P. Biggam:
	8:P. Biggam:
	9:G. Tandy:
	10:C. Mitchell:


C. Smith, P. Biggam, G. Tandy and C. Mitchell can be used as the label references for the
the respective category numbers in the digit file. Notice that each label is followed by a
":". To reference the category numbers 1 and 2 the user would specify the label "C. Smith"
with the capital letters specified correctly and exactly one space between the "." and the
"S". The user would not include the ":" as part of the label.
