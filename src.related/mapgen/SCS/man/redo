            NAME 
            redo - Creates new graphic files for the ovm directory after
            definition parameters for the map element have been changed.
            
            SYNOPSIS 
            redo [all] [fills] [labels] [legend] [lines] [mapdef] [misc] 
                 [symbols]
            
            DESCRIPTION  
            redo executes all of the parameter files, for one or more
            element directories, to create new graphic files for the ovm  
            directory.  Redo executes the appropriate redo.[element] 
            command for every overlay in the element directory.
            
            EXAMPLE 
            If the user created four extensive area fill layers for the
            map composition, and later wished to revise the plotting
            color on two layers, three steps would be required to make
            the change: 1 & 2) edit the parameter files to change the
            pen number, and save the changes; and 3) create new graphic
            files for the ovm directory to reflect the new pen colors.

            NOTE 
            The delete key will abort the redo command.
