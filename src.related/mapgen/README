The map/plot-gen system consists of several basic subdivisions:
	device independent graphics under ./graphics
	cartographic projections, under ./proj
	mapgen system, under ./mapgen
	plotgen system, under ./plotgen
	supplementary library support, under ./lib
	include files under ./include
	complete xx.1 documentation sources, under ./man
	SCS GRASS/MAPGEN interface ./SCS
	X windows graphical editor ./xzoom

The original installation procedure supllied by USGS has been changed
to be directly called from the GRASS GISGEN procedure. This modification
automatically sets the MAPGEN GRAPH variable to be $GRASS/mapgen.
In addition the INSTALL script has been modified to stop if any
compile error is found. The script keeps track of the last code compiled
correctly and can be restarted at that point by calling the GISGEN
routine or running gmake4.0 in this directory. 
To complete the full installation of the interface the following code
must also be installed:
	src.contrib/SCS/misc/FIPS_proj
	src.contrib/SCS/misc/g.setproj

To use a plotter with the GRASS/MAPGEN interface you must identify the
plotter as a printer on your system and edit the $GRASS/mapgen/etc/PLOTTER.
You may also edit the script $GRASS/mapgen/interface/plot.sh to change how
MAPGEN talks to your plotter.

The plotters currently supported can be found in the file 
	./graphics/plotter/devlist.c
All the plotters found before the line #if 0 have been installed.

If you are running XWIN and would like to try USGS xzoom. Look
in the xzoom directory. This is not compiles as part of the GRASS
GISGEN process.

The following is provided by USGS to help programers compile this code
if the automatic scripts fail.

All generation of programs or scripts is provided by standard UNIX
System V.2+ make files or Bourne (or Korn) shell scripts in files
with names [Mm]ake*.  These procedures expect that the
GRAPH and RANLIB environment parameters are appropriately set.
In all cases, executables are placed in the directory $GRAPH/bin and
supplementary support files are placed in $GRAPH/lib when employing
the 'install' option.  Once the system is installed and tested it
may be relocated to alternate 'bin's' and 'lib's'.

Before installation the installer should edit the file
./graphics/plotter/devlist.c to select the supported devices to be
included in program plotter.  This is done by moving the initialization
lines before or after the conditional compile statement #if 0.
The installer may also wish to change local identification of the
particular driver by altering the string within the quotes.  It is
a good idea to create a backup copy before performing this operation.

The installation script INSTALL may be employed to generate all of
the programs and support files in the map/plot-gen system.  If the
installer has device independent troff and wishes to install this
feature then the directory /usr/lib/font/devGRAPH must be created
and made writable by the installer.  Local version of the UNIX program
makedev must also be available in the search path of the installer.
If the troff feature is not desired, error messages generated
by the INSTALL procedure can be ignored.

INSTALL creates the file install.mon, which lists the error status of
each section as they are created.
