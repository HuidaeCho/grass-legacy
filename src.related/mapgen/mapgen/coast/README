An unfortunate error existed in the old version of the coastline
system.  In general, its effects were negligible but a great deal
of data was transformed into coastline files with the error.

To allow the program coast to continue to process the old files
compile with the make option OLD=OLD.  The resultant file coast
or the new version of coast should be renamed so general users
are aware of what release they are using.

The new version also has some new variations in the directory file.

Once all the old coastline files have been corrected the OLD
function should be removed from Makefile and coast.c.

The coastline material is large enough to be considered a sub-
system and given its own directory.  Ancillary to the user routine
coast there are routines of primary interest to system maintenance:

	mcoast - make coastline file

	strpcst - strip data from a coastline file and display
		it in ascii

	bsdcvt - convert 68000 coastline directory
		structure to VAX 7x0 BSD compatible

	remakedir - convert 68000 coastline directory
		structure to 286 Microport, XENIX(?) compatible
		Either routine may be used as a template for
		other conversions.

	newdir - change current system dependent coastline
		directories to system INdependent.
		newdir <old.cdr >new.cdr

The reason for the later routines is that distribution of large
coastline files is by means of the compressed MAPGEN version rather
than the potentially humungous source.  Since most of the original
work was done on the 68000 systems conversion from this system
was the basis of the examples.
