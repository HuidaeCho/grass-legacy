Material in this directory system is for X11R4 program XZOOM
used to display [MAP|PLOT]GEN overlay files and provide elementary
digitizing operations.

For compilation include and library files from the mapgen
distribution are required.

For execution, programs legend and plotter are required
to be in the user's search path and environment parameter
GRAPHB appropriately set for font library path.

Beta 2 version: 21 Sept. 1990 Corrections (additions):
1.	Resizing of graphics area.  Pixmap fixed at 1024x780 maximum
	which is sufficient for most current screens.
2.	Popup file dialog window enhanced with append/overwrite
	options as well as abort.  Better file checking.
3.	"edit pl" command checks for the writability of the file.
4.	Resource file has temporary fix for newline type operations
	messing up the Dialog window.  This will eventually be
	hard coded.  For now, this should be included as it and
	the author would appreciate information on any other key
	which will cause vertical expansion of Text box.
5.	Graphics cursor modified with resource file.
6.	Functionality with DEC3100 servers resolved.
7.	Comments area problems solved.
8.	Other minor fixes and enhancements.
(9).	Pen colors and graphic background controllable with
	resouces file.

Version 1.0 26 Sept. 1990
(10).	csh ~ useable with any file request except meta-i.
11.	Manual expanded.
(12).	Version number listed as label widget first in the
	command pane.

Version 1.01 28 Sept. 1990
(13).	Pen numbers for digitizing output now controllable
	from the pen color list.  Requires use of new resouces file.
(14).	Write protected plotter file now browsable.  ABORT also
	added for writable files.
15.	More code cleanup.

Version 1.02 9 Oct. 1990
16.	Patch so that pens assume main foreground when the indicated
	background matches window background.  Principly a problem
	when resouces not loaded and black and white window appears.
17.	Eliminated fixed max graphic work window.  Any size plot window
	now available.
18.	Other minor improvements.
(19).	Added plot status comments.
20.	Item 4 fixed with internal code so resource file need not
	contain newline type overrides.
21.	Figures put into documentation.

Version 1.03 29 Nov. 1990
22.	Cured problem with bad plotgen scaling, partly due to non-
	reenterability of 'scalein'.
23.	Placed routine previously loaded from other libraries localy.
24.	Modified 'emess' so that messages from scalein would appear
	on screen.
25.	Added default legend character initialization when openning
	new 'digit' file (or overwriting).
26.	Put routines handling MAP/PLOT-GEN def files in src.
	No need to use outside libraries.
27.	Edit src/Makefile to select which version of device independent
	vector graphics system being employed.

Persistant problems and knonw deficiencies:
1.	Current 386 servers run out of memory.  Hopefully will
	be fixed with new releases.
2.	CERL having problems with writing out edited plotter file.
3.	Xzoom assumes a square aspect ratio for screen pixels.
	Usually OK for modern workstations but may be a problem
	for PCs used as servers.  Solvable, but not going to
	worry about it until item 1 become available.
