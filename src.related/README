The following directories in "src.related" contain source code that,
though not integrated into GRASS, is related to GRASS.  They are each
complete stand-alone systems.   Only bnoise has built-in capabilities
for generating GRASS files.   All of the others have been experimentally
linked with GRASS for various demonstrations, but do not contain user
supported GRASS links.

bnoise          - Fortran blast-noise analysis program (CERL) with C user
    		      front-end for GRASS users.
grass.armsed    - Fortran watershed analysis program.
