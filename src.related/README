Added:
   wwwinterface - perl scripts for on-line map serving
   global-shorelines

Libraries:
 r.stage3-libs/
  The netcdf-libraries are required for r.stage3
 
 tcltkgrass/
  Here tcl/tk 8.0 libraries...
  These libraries are required to create the TclTKGRASS buttons etc.
  => stored in a separate package due to minimize the main package size.

 xgrass/
  Here are lesstif - libraries (a MOTIF clone) stored (new 1998),
  also platform indepentent. You may use lesstiff instead of the commercial
  MOTIF libraries.
  => stored in a separate package due to minimize the main package size.

Programs in this directory are NOT GRASS commands, but are public domain
capabilities that may be useful to those advanced GRASS sites.

 LTPlus_4.13/  (new August 1998)
  This program allows automated raster to vector conversion.
  -> can be compiled, running

             for numerous plotters from geometric or latitude-longitude
             coordinates.
  * nrcs/MAPGEN - product of SCS.  Seamlessly marries mapgen to GRASS
  -> can be compiled now with gmake4.2 !
  => stored in a separate package due to minimize the main package size.
