Changes during the beta test period, starting on 15jan91:

    fitstopgm was using "bzero" as a struct member; changed to bzer.
      (David Elliott, Doug Claar)
    Include-file re-ordering in pbmplus.h to make the BROKENPUTC1 fix
      work properly. (Markus Bolz)
    Lots of cleanup work on the man pages.
    In the pgmtoppm colorization tool, changed the separator for the
      two-color case from ',' to '-', since ',' was also being used
      in specifying RGB colors.
    Fixed typos in README, FORMATS.
    Added statics to pbmmask and pbmtoepson to avoid a name conflict.
    Added casts to ppmpat, ppmdraw.h, libppm5 to avoid warnings.
    Minor fixes to hipstopgm, pnmarith, libpbm5, giftoppm, xim.h, pnmtoxwd,
      ppmtogif, gemtopbm, pi3topbm. (Arthur David Olson and gcc 1.39)

      extraneous includes from giftoppm; corrected typo in pbmtog3.1;
      added ifdef's around definition of M_PI in ppmpat, pnmrotate, pnmshear.
      (Francois Pinard)
    Added new man page installation option to Makefiles. (Philip Gladstone)
    Re-worded TIFF configuration instructions in Makefile.
    No more trailing blanks when writing PGM and PPM plain format.
    Tried a compile with gcc -Wall, and made bunches of minor tweaks to
      avoid warnings.
    Fixes to pbmtolj. (Arthur David Olson, Mike Hench)
    Portability fixes for the Convex - casting malloc to char*, no
      static function decls inside other functions. (Anthony A. Datri)
    Added new rasterfile types and 32-bit support to to rast.h, libpnm4,
      rasttopnm, pnmtorast.
    Added #undefs to pbmplus.h for max, min, abs, odd, in case they are
      already defined. (Selden E. Ball, Jr.)

    Fixes to pbmtog3 to make it compatible with more fax machines.
      (Klaus U. Schallhorn)
    Makefile fixes to remove old scripts and binaries before installing new
      ones; fixed typo in xwdtopnm.1. (Arthur David Olson)
    Changed ppmquant to keep reducing maxval until it can make a histogram.
    Fixed typo in anytopnm. (Ken Laprade)
    Added rawtoppm, and minor tweaks to rawtopgm.
    Minor bugfix to ppmquant -map.
    Minor correction to pgmoil.
    Added declaration of realloc() to pbmplus.h.
    Replaced fixed-size arrays in pbmmask, pbmtext, libpnm4, xwdtopnm, pnmcat.
    Removed extraneous include of sys/file.h from giftoppm.
      (Selden E. Ball, Jr.)
    Minor fix to error messages in libpgm1 and libppm1.
    Made pnmtorast always write 256-element colormaps again - some rasterfile
      readers can't handle short maps.
    Changed error messages in p?mmerge.
    Correct bug in pi3topbm. (R C Smith)
    Removed here-doc quotes from pnmsmooth. (Arthur David Olson, Jim Hanko)
    Fix to fitstopgm for files that don't have DATAMIN and DATAMAX cards.
      (Steve Allen)
    In pgmnorm and pgmoil, moved the hist array to the global frame
      to avoid local frame storage problems if BIGGRAYS is set.

      xwdtopbm and xwdtoppm into xwdtopnm;
      pbmtoxwd and ppmtoxwd into pnmtoxwd.
    Promoted some filters:
      pcxtopbm to pcxtoppm;
      ppmarith to pnmarith;
      ppmconvol to pnmconvol;
      ppmcscale to pnmdepth;

      ppmscale to pnmscale;
      ppmshear to pnmshear;
      ppmsmooth to pnmsmooth;
      tifftopgm to tifftopnm - new version based on Sam Leffler's libtiff.
    Bugfixes to pbmtoicon, ppmtops.
    The Makefiles now have a "merge" option.
    All flags are now case-insensitive.
    Added $(MAKE) stuff to Makefile.
    Changed pnmsmooth from a csh script to a sh script.
    Made macro use in pbmtox10bm and pbmtoxbm more portable.
    Moved compataliases to compat.csh, and added compat.ksh.
    Made ppmtoilbm less Amiga-specific.
    Added -headerskip and -rowskip flags to rawtopgm.
    Enhanced rasttopnm to interpret 8-bit rasters with no colormap as grayscale.
    Changed sscanf %g to %f - some systems can't handle %g on input.
    Added -expand flag to pbmmask.
    Speedup to pnmflip - don't buffer if possible.
    Added color-name-to-value routine to ppm - uses X11's rgb.txt if present.
    Updated Imakefile support to reflect X.V11R4.
    Removed picttopbm.
    Improved pnmcut argument syntax so that negative coords work like pnmpaste.
    Added "magic" file, for use with the "file" program.
    40% speedup for pgmnorm from Robert Stockton (rgs@cs.cmu.edu).
    Fixed long-standing bug involving colormaps on SPARCstations when
      compiled with gcc -- had to do with passing structs by value.
    Removed the -x flag from pnmtorast -- it's not really needed.
    Fixed subtle bug in the pnm reading code that caused pnmcat to blow
      it on images that differed greatly in width or height.
    New version of giftoppm that handles the GIF89a standard, and doesn't
      use fseek.
    Fixed fitstopgm to handle three-axis images, such as the Hubble pix.
    Xwdtopnm and pnmtoxwd finally handle byte-order properly.
    Added -xysize flag to pnmscale.
    Added conditional ANSI function prototypes to library routines.
    Added -noantialias flag to pnmrotate and pnmshear.
    Removed the TIPS file.  No one ever sent in any new tips, so I just
      moved the few I had into the relevant man pages.  That's probably
      where they belonged in the first place.
    Added justification flags to pnmcat.
    Added -map flag to ppmquant - user-specifiable colormap.  Also, the
      Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion finally works right.
    Added -map flag to pgmtoppm.
    Added DirectColor support to xwdtopnm and pnmtoxwd.
    Speedup to pgmtolj from Arthur David Olson: avoid sending whitespace.
    Fix to pbmtogo from Bo Thide': 2D compression now works.

Patch 1 to the X.V11R4 / comp.sources.misc distribution of 22nov89:

    Fixed bug in pgmtops -rle.

Changes since the alt.sources distribution of 13sep89:

    Small corrections to ppmtorast, pgmtops.
    Moved pbm/tifftopbm to pgm/tifftopgm - it now handles grayscale TIFF files.
    Fixed tifftopgm to handle non-native byte order.
    Changes to tifftopgm to handle bogus AppleScan TIFF files, to have
      better command syntax, and to use stdio.
    Optimizations to xbmtopbm, pbmtoxbm, and pbmtox10bm, courtesy of
      Juha Sarlin, to make them go about three times as fast.
    Optimization to pgmtops and ppmtops to make them go three times as fast.
    Optimization to pnmcrop.
    Added PBMPLUS_BROKENPUTC defines in pbmplus.h to handle systems (such as
      ULTRIX) which have broken putc() macros.
    Rewrote ppmscale, pnmcat, and pgmhist to operate line-by-line, instead
      of reading in the whole image.
    Rewrote pnmflip to keep only one copy of the image in memory.
    Added pgmtofits, courtesy of Wilson H. Bent, plus bugfixes to fitstopgm
      and a patch to giftoppm to handle black&white GIF files.
    Added picttopbm and rawtopgm.
    Fixes to xwdtoppm and ppmtoxwd so they compile with SunOS cc as well as gcc.
    Another small change to ppmtoxwd having to do with colormap size.
    Changed macptopbm's -headersize flag to be -extraskip.
    Changed tgatoppm to read color values as BGRA instead of ARGB; the Targa
      documentation is apparently wrong about the order.
    Some changes to the Makefiles, partially to work around bugs in gnumake.
    Got g3topbm working, and added pbmtog3, courtesy of Paul Haeberli.
    Added some pixrect work-alike code so that rasttopbm, pbmtorast, rasttoppm,
      and ppmtorast can be used on non-Sun systems.  This also provides a
      final solution to the persistent byte- and bit-order problems on 386's.
    Moved the SYSV-checking #ifdefs to *after* the include of pbm.h, which
      defines SYSV.
    Made all the #else's and #endif's ANSI-compliant.
    Added manual pages for libpbm, libpgm, libppm, and libpnm, courtesy
      of Tony Hansen.
    Changed man page installation so that pages from different sections
      can go in different directories.
    Fixed Imakefiles.

Changes since the expo.lcs.mit.edu FTP distribution of 06sep89:

    Added #ifdefs to pnm/libpnm3.c to allow the PBM-PNM-only configuration.
    Small corrections to TIPS, pnm/Makefile, pnm/Imakefile, ppm/ppmrotate.1,
      ppm/ppmshear.1, ppm/ppmtoilbm.c, pbm/xwdtopbm.c, ppm/xwdtoppm.c,
      ppm/ppmtoxwd.c, ppm/ppmtoxwd.1, pbm/x11wd.h.

Changes since the comp.sources.misc distribution of 31oct88:

    Added pbmreduce, pbmlife, pbmmask, and pbmupc.
    Added gemtopbm, tifftopbm, pcxtopbm, pbmtogo, mgrtopbm, pbmtomgr,
      cmuwmtopbm, pbmtocmuwm, g3topbm, and pbmtobg.
    Minor bugfix to pbmtolj.
    Slight restructuring of most of the programs to use vastly less memory.
    Various other minor optimizations.
    Fixed pbmtorast and rasttopbm to handle byte-swapped big-endian 386 boxes.
    Slight changes to argument syntax of pbmcrop, pbmmake, pbmreduce.
    Moved to the new PGM package: pbmtops (which now produces Conforming PS).
    Moved to the new PPM package: giftopbm.
    Moved to the new PNM package: pbmcrop pbmcut pbmenlarge pbminvert.
    Consolidated into a single pnmflip tool: pbmfliplr pbmfliptb pbmtrnspos.
    Consolidated into a single pnmcat tool: pbmcatlr pbmcattb.
    Added compataliases script for upward compatability with changed tools.
    Removed xxxtopbm.
    Added a -headersize flag to macptopbm, to help get around annoying
      problems in MacPaint file format.
    Added the RAWBITS compilation-time option, to use a more compact and
      much faster (but less portable) external format.
    Removed the CBM format - use compress(1) and / or RAWBITS instead.
    Pbmpaste (and the new pnmpaste) now accepts negative x and y coords,
      which are interpreted relative to the right and bottom sides.
    Changed all programs to accept a "-" file argument as meaning standard
      input.
    Removed pbmtox10wd, since it was never very useful (X10 doesn't have xwud).
    Added Imakefiles, for X11 types to use.

Changes since the X.V11R3 distribution of 31aug88:

    The cbm format has been revised to support run-length encoding.
    Pbmtops now does run-length encoding.

Major changes since the X.V11R2 distribution of 28mar88:

    The pbm format now has a "magic number".
    New conversion filters: brushtopbm, giftopbm, pbmtolj, pbmtomacp,
      pbmtoxwd, and pbmtox10wd.
    Icontopbm converter has a better parser -- it knows to skip over
      any extraneous comments at the beginning of the icon file.
    Pbmtops generates a different PostScript wrapper program -- it should
      handle huge bitmaps better.
    Xwdtopbm now handles byte-swapping correctly.
    Pbmmake takes a flag to specify the color of the new bitmap.
    Pbmpaste now implements 'or', 'and', and 'xor' operations as well
      as the default 'replace'.
