.TH ppmtops 1 "01 September 1989"
.SH NAME
ppmtops - convert a portable pixmap into color Encapsulated PostScript
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ppmtops
.RB [ -scale
.IR s ]
.RI [ ppmfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable pixmap as input.
Produces Encapsulated PostScript as output, using the colorimage
operator.
This operator is only defined on color printers and very recent B&W printers.
Most of the time you will NOT want to use ppmtops; instead, do a
.BR "ppmtopgm | pgmtops" .
.PP
Note that there is no pstoppm
tool - this transformation is one-way, because a pstoppm tool would
be a full-fledged PostScript interpreter, which is beyond the scope
of this package.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -scale
Controls the scale of the result.  The default scale is 1,
which on a 300 dpi printer such as the Apple LaserWriter makes
the output look about the same size as the input would if it was displayed
on a typical 72 dpi screen.
.PP
All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
