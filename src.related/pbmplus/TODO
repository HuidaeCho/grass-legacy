Things still to be done, in approximate order of likelihood:


Test the TIFF and xwd converters on a little-endian box.

Imakefile fixes from David Lawrence.

Merge pgmtops and ppmtops into pnmtops; add auto-scaling and -rotate flag.

VMS fixes from Terry Poot.

Add IBM, Mac, and Amiga stuff to OTHER.SYSTEMS file.

picttoppm and ppmtopict may still have some bugs.

ilbmtoppm and ppmtoilbm should handle some of the new Amiga image formats.

ppmtoilbm should not bother with HAM mode if the "colors" are actually
grays.

hipstopgm should have a -image flag like fitstopgm and giftoppm.

Add ppmtocmyk4.

Upgrade xpmtoppm and ppmtoxpm to handle XPM2.

Turn pbmtoascii into pgmtoascii, using the font routines from pbmtext.

Figure out why ppmquant doesn't generate all N colors.  Maybe the
colormap it makes has some duplicate entries.

Figure out why compiling pnmconvol makes gcc die on some systems.

Fix the inflection-point leaks in ppmd_fill().

The Converter Generator reorganization: all filters become three library
routines, one to initialize, one to handle each line, and one to finish off.
This will make it possible to generate self-contained pipelines on demand,
and they should run substantially faster without all that I/O.
