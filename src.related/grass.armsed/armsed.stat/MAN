.SH NAME
collect \- generate statistics for input to MULTSED
.SH SYNOPSIS
collect
.SH DESCRIPTION
Collect
generates statistics concerning soil textures and cover
data based on the areas provided in some sort of division
map layer.  The division map layer might be one which
depicts the subbasins within a given watershed, with each
subbasin divided into the left and right planes as defined
by the (possibly extended) channel segment for that subbasin.
Alternately, the divisions might be areas based on 
homogeneity (similar soil texture, slope class, etc.).
Statistics will be given in an output file which can then
be used in the interface to format input for MULTSED. 
Statistics will be given for whatever input files are
available from the following:  if an elevation map layer
(with true elevation values) is available, overland slope
(and channel slope if channel segments are given) will be
provided with the output; if a soils texture file is 
available, output will include values for parameters
such as porosity and hydraulic conductivity; if a cover
file is available for input, percent cover will be
calculated.  If the division file is based on subbasins,
and the channel segment file has been input or derived
in GRASS, values will also be given for channel segment
length and overland flow length.  Input is interactive.
.SH SOIL LAYER
The soil texture map layer specified by the user
must contain the following soils texture categories
(which most likely will have been reclassed from
a soils survey):

.NF
Category #        Soil Texture Represented
----------        ------------------------
    0                 no data
    1                 Sand
    2                 Loamy Sand
    3                 Sandy Loam
    4                 Loam
    5                 Silty Loam
    6                 Sandy Clay Loam
    7                 Clay Loam
    8                 Silty Clay Loam
    9                 Sandy Clay
   10                 Silty Clay
   11                 Clay

.SH COVER LAYER
The cover map layer should be given with the following category
representations:

.NF
Category #        Cover Type Represented
----------        ----------------------
    0                 no data
    1                 Canopy cover
    2                 Ground cover
    3                 Impervious cover

.SH NOTES
The current window setting is ignored.  Instead,
the window for the division file is used.
Program collect can work on division map layers
with values higher than 255 (that is, supercell
division map layers).
If no data values in either the soil texture or
cover map layers cover more than 50 percent of
any given division area, statistics will not
be estimated for that area.  Otherwise, all no
data values are combined with the soil texture
or cover type which comprises the majority of that
division area.
