.SH DESCRIPTION
Gdivide
generates an output layer depicting left and right half planes
for each subbasin of a watershed given in the input file basins.
Also needed for input is a map layer depicting extended stream
networks.

The map layer depicting left and right half planes is 
necessary for collecting data by half plane for use
in other models.
The data collected might include such information as area
of the plane or slope of the plane.  This process is 
necessary in the steps to provide information for the
water and sediment runoff model armsed as part of the
GRASS to armsed interface.
.SH NOTES
may have problems completing correctly if a stream lies
directly next to a watershed boundary.
