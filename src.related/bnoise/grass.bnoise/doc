add_weapon()
	-

ask_weapon(num_wtable)
	-assumes weapons structure has been initialized and weapons table
	read in.  returns number that have been chosen.

choose_weapon(num_wtable)
	-assumes temp1 file is available for use (name has been fetched)
	if global variable "num_weapons" is zero, opens temp1 for write,
	else opens for append.  calls ask_weapon to choose, adds number
	chosen to "num_weapons" and calls write_weapon.

read_weapon(fd,inc_num,read_num)
    -assumes file (fd) is open for reading.  if passed argument "read_num"
	is zero, number of weapons is read from fd, else assumed no number
	is in the file and the passed value is used.  weapons structure is
	then initialized, and data for "read_num" weapons read into it.  for
	each weapon type, include is set to inc_num, and the used_codes index
	is updated.  closes file, returns number of weapons read (different
	from passed number if passed number was zero).

show_weapons()
	-assumes global variable "num_weapons" is set correctly.  prints
	out weapon codes and names for all currently chosen weapons

write_weapon(num_wtable)
	-assumes temp1_fd is set, and weapons table includes "num_wtable"
	weapons.  writes weapons info to temp1_fd for all those that
	have include set to 1.
