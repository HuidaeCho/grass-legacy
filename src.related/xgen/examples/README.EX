Example is a demonstration script that takes advantage of most of the 
functionality of Xgen. Some of the geometry and window placement could 
be tweaked, but other than that it is in good shape. Some of the programs 
called might not exist on your system.

GRASS.example is an interface to GRASS 4.0 and other related commands, 
it will definitely not work well without GRASS 4.0 (a *huge* public domain
geographical information system available via anonymous ftp from 
uxc.cso.uiuc.edu (128.174.5.50)), but it will give 
you more examples to work from.

Xgen.intro is a script that describes GRASS sort of like a video presentation
Some of the fonts may not work well on your system, but you get the idea.

The rest of the files in this directory just support the examples.
