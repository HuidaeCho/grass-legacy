The document in this directory is valid for the current version of xgen.
I only have postscript format at the moment, so I hope you all have
access to a postscript printer. If you don't, please call the GRASS
Information Center at 1-800-USA-CERL x220 (inside Illinois (217) 373-7220),
ask for the xgen document, and you shall receive.
