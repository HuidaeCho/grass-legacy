This directory contains all source code for the cartographic projection
program 'proj' as well as some useful utilities.  Although often distributed
as part of the MAPGEN package, proj is a useful utility in its own right.

Examine first screenful of Makefile before proceeding with installation.

Unfortunately, there is not a consistent mechanism for handling librarys
for various flavors of UNIX 'make' programs.  This is System V's and
the installer may be required to hack the Makefile for other flavors.
Sorry! (It works best on uPort System V/386 and reasonably well on
Masscomp, DEC ultrix and Sun's).

To install 'proj':
	make install

To install 'for/inv[27|83]':
	make nad

The supplementary installation is not part of the normal 'graph'
install operation.  There may be discrepancies between its
results and "official" state plane conversions.  Unfortunately,
standards for comparison are unknown at this moment.

For more complete desription of 'proj' see:
	"Cartographic Projection Procedures for the UNIX
	Environment---A User's Manual" by G.I.Evenden,
	USGS Open-File Report 90-284.

Release notes:
Rel. 2	Improved precision for meridian distance computation thus
	affecting accuracy of transverse mercator (& UTM), polyconic,
	bonne, sinusoidal, ...

	New option to specify precision of seconds in DMS output.

	Added projects.h id to 'what' key.

	Minor corrections to other projections.

Rel. 3	Revised and simplified general structure of individual projection
	procedures.

	Simplified proj program by eliminating some functions which
	are better performed with other UNIX utilities.

	Removed program 'ellipse' and included ellipsoidal selection
	within the projection program itself.

	Added geocentric latitude capability and over ranging for latitude.

	Binary I/O individually selectable for input and output.

	Improved error diagnostics.  Options included to list available
	projections and standard ellipsoids.

	Expanded tutorial documentation: see reference above.

	Both NAD27 and NAD83 SPCS procedures included.

	Man files simplified to allow for simple tty type output.

Rel. 3, Version 1:
	Chebyshev coefficient output added to 'proj' with -T switch.

	Program 'fproj' added which employs above Chebyshev coefficients and,
	except for + commands and some - switches, performs like 'proj'.

	These elements are to be considered beta at the moment (11 May 90).
