                    History

2/21/92

Greclass names are changed in the following files to convert to grass4.0 version

cell_num_id.c
misc_routines.c

removed G_system calls from the following routines
slope_aspect.c
get_input_names.c


1995: 
Comments on Zhian's wonderful work!

1.  Many new parameters were added to agnps_input.h to 
    represent point source data

2.  The agnps_input.c source is now 3 times as large as previously to 
    enable inputting and handling of point source data.

3.  Two new functions have been added for input:

get_pts_dat.c

  Displays the  watershed map and enables the user to enter the 
  point source data at any site in the watershed.  Up to 9 point 
  sources are allowed per site.  

ptsrc_input.c

  Called by get_pts_dat.c for detailed description of point source data. 

4.  The original get_wshd_input.c function has been modified to 
    accomodate the new features.

2,4,6/1996: 
  Several changes made by NCSU

12.12.1996:       
         Corrections were necessary in
                  agnps_input.c
         to use the agnps_input_2 with LinuX. 
         The import of K-factor and C-factor was not done in
         the correct way: The conversion of the category
         (string), containing the K-factor resp. the C-factor, into
         the float-format was incorrect (error-message: "K-factor not
         between 0-1"). So I made a correction of these conversion 
         commands.
         Other Changes: The K-factor was tested twice of it's correct
         value, the second test is changed now to the test of the 
         C-factor value (makes more sense...).

         
         Changed the number of Maximum cells from 10000 to 50000.
         This change was made in agnps_input.h

         Other changes were made in 
               src_agnps_input_1/agnps_input.h
         See COMMENTS.txt there.

19.12.96
 - Renamed agnps_input2 to agnps_input2a in Gmakefile

 - Changed misc_routines.c for using r.cn2 instead of r.cn


15. March 1998 - Markus Neteler

    New names for the modules

       renamed
         agnps_input -> r.agnps50.input
         run_agnps50 -> r.agnps50.run
         agnps_view  -> r.agnps50.view
