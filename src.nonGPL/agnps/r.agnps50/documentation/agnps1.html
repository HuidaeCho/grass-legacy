Parts of the input file generator of this tool were based generally
on the AGNPS/GRASS Input Interface Tool (version 1.1) developed
by R. Srinivasan and B.A. Engel (1994). Changes include updating
the input file generator for AGNPS version 5.0, improvement in
fertilizer application, curve number, and aspect map routines,
and addition of the capability for user input of point source,
channel, fertilizer, and pesticide data for specified cells. A
separate program for viewing model output was also developed.

Funding was provided through the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency cooperative agreement #CR822270, Understanding the Role
of Agricultural Landscape Feature Function and Position in Achieving
Environmental Endpoints, to the NCSU Water Quality Group.
