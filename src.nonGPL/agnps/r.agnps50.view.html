<H2>Guidelines for AGNPS-GRASS Output Interface (The Visualization Tool)</h2>
<p>
Current NPS models including AGNPS have very limited graphics capability
for visualizing
and analyzing the model output.
A distributed parameter model should assist in pinpointing the critical areas
where one needs to pay attention for controlling NPS pollution.
Even though AGNPS gives detailed output, users often can not make use of it,
due to lack of proper analyzation and visualization tools.
Graphical displays of the results have proven to be a more effective
and efficient way of interpreting the results and in making decisions
than scaning through pages and pages of numerical output in the form
of tables.
The following sections discuss the visualization tool in detail.

<EM>AGNPS Output Parameters</EM>
<p>
Various output options are available with the AGNPS model. Primary output
given for watersheds being analyzed includes watershed area, cell size,
storm precipitation, rainfall erosivity (EI), estimates of runoff volume, peak 
flow rate at the watershed outlet, area-weighted erosion, both upland
and channel. Also given are estimates of the sediment delivery ratio, sediment
enrichment ratio, mean sediment concentration, and total sediment yield for
each of five sediment particle size classes. Also available is a nutrient analysis,
which include N, P and COD mass per unit area for both soluble and sediment
adsorbed nutrients, and N, P and COD concentrations in the runoff. Table 1 lists
a summary of output parameters that can be obtained for each cell or all cells
if desired.

Initially the visualization interface generates 17 maps (Table 2) from the
ASCII output files of an AGNPS run. The generated
maps can be saved for future evaluation of output.
All maps are generated using the <B>reclass</B> principle of the GRASS
GIS tool, thereby minimum disk space is required. The map
from which all output maps were reclassed (cell number map,
<EM>filename_cell_num</EM>, where filename refers to the AGNPS ASCII input/output 
file without its extension) should not be removed.

<B>Name of the AGNPS-GRASS Output Interface Program</B>: <EM>vis_tool</EM>
.<p>
<B>Procedures to follow while executing the Output Interface (the Visualization Tool)</B>:
<p>
First start GRASS 3.1 from a shelltool window with the mapset where
the data resides.
<p>
Resize the graphics monitor to fit the full screen of the workstation and
use the <EM>Dselect.mon</EM> program to select the monitor. 
The GRASS shelltool window
should be at the right hand side bottom of the screen.
<p>
Execute the <EM>vis_tool</EM> program from the shelltool window where GRASS
is running
<p>
A <EM>Visualization Tool Input</EM> menu will appear on the shelltool window requesting the
following data/information from the user:
<p>
Enter Watershed Map name: Enter the name of the watershed boundary map 
containing cell values greater than zero and zero's for cells outside the watershed boundary.
<p>
Enter the cell size in meters: The length of the side of a cell in meters for which the model was run is entered. 
<p>
Enter Aspect Map name: Enter the name of the aspect map for the watershed.
It should have been created for the same resolution as the cell size above. 
<p>
Enter the ASCII AGNPS file name without its extension: Enter the ASCII AGNPS file name
without its extension since the program takes the default extension of <EM>.dat</EM>
and <EM>.nps</EM> for input and output of the model, respectively. These files should be
in the current working directory, else give the full path with the file name.
<p>

Then hit the <EM>Esc</EM> key to continue.
Always look for a message at the bottom of the ASCII screen for continuing
the execution, if there is no message then hit <EM>Enter</EM> after answering
the question else hit <EM>Esc</EM> to continue.
<p>
In the following sections, each output screen of the visualization tool is
discussed. The visualization tool splits the screen into various screens to display
the output of the model. The number of windows created depends on the type
of output displayed. The tool always reserves an ASCII terminal (non graphics)
for interacting with the user. 
The first screen (Figure 1) provides various options including a
watershed summary (no graphics) and spatially distributed soil loss, nutrients,
runoff and feedlot movement (graphics) output of a watershed.

7. Save Output Maps
8. Exit to GRASS (to come back type 'return')
9. Quit
Enter the choice (1-9):

</PRE>
<p>
Option 1 (Figure 1) displays the watershed summary for soil loss,
runoff and nutrient movement at the watershed outlet.
This output is displayed in the non-graphics window. The
watershed summary can be accessed from any part of the visualization tool,
providing an opportunity for decision makers/users to compare the detailed cell
output with the watershed outlet output for making decisions.
<p>
Options 2-5 (Figure 1) move to the next screen (Figure 2)
where the appropriate output option maps are displayed.
This screen is divided into numerous windows depending on the
output option chosen. The screen is divided in half, having
a series of top row windows and bottom row windows with an ASCII terminal.
The top row windows display the output
maps (Table 2). A scale for each of the output maps is displayed showing
the color and the numerical value associated with it. The color of the output
maps range from green-yellow-red, with increasing intensity of output.
The right hand top corner window displays the watershed
map with cell numbers by laying a grid on top of it for reference.
Below this cell number map, the aspect map of the watershed with arrows
pointing in the flow directions is displayed.
In the bottom row, two windows display the
output and input statistics for any cell. The left window shows cell inputs.
The output window shows a bar chart and key features
of the output option statistics for the same cell. The default
cell statistics displayed in the bottom row windows are the statistics
for the outlet cell of the watershed.
The tool provides error checking and also explains
what to do at each step.
<p>
In the next section, options 6-9 of Figure 1 are discussed.
<p>
<EM>Analyze Different Scenarios</EM>: This option allows the user to visualize and 
analyze a different simulation for the same resolution of the 
original run. The user is asked to enter the name of the ASCII AGNPS file
name without its extension. The AGNPS run that was started with the visualization
tool is called the 'current' and the simulation that was selected using
this option is referred as 'selected' hereafter in this documentation.
The program checks the resolutions between the 'current' and the 'selected' runs and checks for the same file names.
Then the program creates the 17 output maps (Table 2) and displays the 'current' and the 'selected' output maps on the screen in the top row windows. The default
output is the sediment movement maps. Bottom row
windows display the output histograms of the 'current' and the 'selected' simulations.
The left bottom row window corresponds to the 'current' input/output
window and the right bottom row window corresponds to the 'selected'
input/output.
<p>
Under this option the user has the same options (Figure 2) discussed 
earlier in this document. In addition to this, the user can alter the
output visualization/analyzation to other model outputs such as sediment,
nutrients, feedlot or runoff movement. While using options 2 and 3 (Figure 2),
the user is asked to select either input or output to view in the bottom row windows.
<p>
For options 5 and 8 (Figure 2), the user is asked to select either
the 'current' or the 'selected' simulation results to view in a window.
<p>
This option is one of the strongest feature of the visualization tool
for analyzing different scenarios simultaneously.
<p>
<EM>Save Output Maps</EM>: This option allows the user to save the maps created
using the visualization tool. The user
can save all or only those outputs of interest, which include sediment, N, P, 
COD, and runoff. The program asks the user to enter a map name for 
saving the output
maps. The program attaches proper extensions depending on the type of outputs (Appendix 1).
Please refer to the appendix 1 for the extensions of different map names.
It also contains reserved map names that should not exist in the current mapset.
Do not remove the <EM>filename_cell_num</EM> map, since all output maps
created in the visualization tool are reclassed from the created cell number
map.
<p>
<EM>Exit to GRASS (to come back type 'return')</EM>: This option allows the user
to exit to the GRASS temporarily to perform normal operations under the GRASS GIS
tool. To come back to the same menu in the visualization tool, type <EM>return</EM> and hit enter.
<p>
<EM>Quit</EM>: This option takes the user back the GRASS prompt and exits from
the visualization tool. The output maps created will be removed from the
current mapset, but will not affect those maps that are saved using the
<EM>Save Output Maps</EM> option. If you plan to use output maps at some future
time, be sure to save them.

</PRE>
<p>
Each of the options in Figure 2 is discussed below: Its usage and
how this assists users or decision makers is described.
These options can be used alone or in combination with other options.
<p>
<EM>1. Zoom</EM>: Allows users to zoom in or zoom out of any section of
the watershed by choosing one of the displayed windows. Once the zoom operation is
performed, the tool automatically adjusts or redisplays all the maps in the
top row windows to the same area, enabling users to take a closer look
at an area of interest. This option is particularly helpful on large watersheds.
Once the <EM>Zoom</EM> option is selected, the tool requests for a window 
to perform zoom operations. The user has to use the left mouse key to click
on one of the top row windows and then click on the right mouse key to complete
the selection process. Then the <EM>zoom</EM> function asks the user to use
the left mouse to click on a place to define the area in the selected window,
and then drag the mouse to the desired location and click on the right mouse key
to complete the zoom process. Always follow the instructions displayed
on the ASCII terminal. Failing to do so can cause the program to stop. Similarly,
the unzoom operation can be performed.
<p>
<EM>2. View a cell</EM>: This option allows the user to enter a cell number of
interest to display the statistics of that cell's inputs and outputs in the
bottom row of windows. The displayed bar chart depends on the type of
option chosen in the initial screen (Figure 1). The cell number can be either
entered directly using the keyboard in the ASCII terminal or the mouse can be 
used to point out a cell on the graphics monitor using the left mouse key after
choosing one of the top row windows. The window selection process is detailed
in the <EM>Zoom</EM> section.
This feature is helpful to visualize characteristics of both inputs
and outputs of a critical area.
<p>
<EM>3. View an area output</EM>: This option allows the user to select an area
from one of the top row windows and displays the average input and output
statistics for that area in the bottom row windows. Here also, the user
is asked to select a window from the top row windows using the
selection procedure explained earlier. Then using the left
mouse key, the user selects a corner of the desired area and drags the
mouse to build a box. Click the right mouse key to complete the process.
This information is helpful to study the statistics of the
critical areas and its neighbors. Using this option, one could estimate
average inputs and outputs for a field which should assist in making further
decisions.
<p>
<EM>4. Toggle between flow direction map and viewing window location</EM>: This
feature is helpful when users use <EM>Zoom</EM> to view any particular section
of the watershed. After a couple of zoom operations, users may
loose track of which part of the watershed is displayed. This option
toggles between the flow direction map and the whole watershed map showing a
box around the current viewing area.
<p>
<EM>5. Show the watershed summary output</EM>: The summary at the
outlet of the watershed for all the outputs is displayed in the
ASCII (non graphics) terminal. This option is useful to correlate
cell outputs with those of watershed outputs to make decisions.
<p>
<EM>6. Display ranges of output maps</EM>: This option allows users to visualize
output maps (Table 2) for a specified range between maximum
and minimum values of the output (Figure 1) chosen. This helps users locate
critical areas easily. For example, users can use this option to display
problematic areas that are exceeding the soil tolerance limit (T factor).
Options are available
to save the displayed maps for later reference, compare various scenarios or
overlay one map on another in order to make decisions.
<p>
<EM>7. Display user's choice map</EM>: Users have an option to display a cell
map, overlay a map on another map or display a vector map. The chosen map
can be displayed on one of the existing windows or users have an option to
create
a new window anywhere in the graphics monitor to display the map.
Further, the map chosen for display can be one of the AGNPS output maps (Table 2)
generated from the AGNPS output files or one of the existing maps in the
database. From of the users/decision makers point of view, this option is helpful
to reach conclusions about management strategies. For example, by overlaying
a field boundary or property boundary on an erosion map,
fields within critical limits can be located.
Combinations of various outputs can be viewed simultaneously on the designed
graphic windows.
On selection of this option, the user is prompted for the map to be displayed.
If the user
selects to display the map in one of the existing windows, then the selection of the window
operation is performed followed by the selection of the type of display. This could
be to display a cell map, overlay a map on another map or display a vector map.
Maps are listed for selection. If the user selected the option to
create a new window to display a map, then the program requests 
a location to start the window. Using the left mouse key, drag the mouse
to create a box of desired size and click the right mouse key to end the
process. 
<p>
<EM>8. Draw Cumulative and Frequency Distribution Statistics</EM>: This option
allows the user to view the percentage of cumulative and frequency distribution 
area curves for
any of the output maps (Table 2) or selective input variables for either
user specified ranges of intervals/classes or for 10 equal ranges of intervals/classes between the maximum and minimum
of the selected variable. This option is helpful to see how that particular
variable is distributed both cumulatively and the number of occurrences 
in that interval. It is believed this information in combination with
spatial referenced maps could be of very useful in the decision making process.
The steepness of the curve shows how that variable is increasing within a corresponding range.
By choosing this option, the program requests a window to display
the statistical curves. Then, the program asks the user to select
either an input or output variable for which to draw the curves. The
user then has the option of keeping the previously selected X-axis intervals/classes or can
select a new range of intervals/classes. The selection of new ranges of intervals can
be done in one of two ways. Either the user can select 10 equal intervals between
the maximum and minimum of the selected variable or he can enter the ranges between
the maximum and minimum values. In either case, the number of intervals can't
exceed 10.
<p>
<EM>9. Restore the initial screen</EM>: This option restores the original or
initial display screen that was initiated when one of the options from Figure 1
was chosen.
<p>
<EM>10. Exit to GRASS (to come back type 'return')</EM>: This option allows the user
to exit to the GRASS temporarily to perform normal operations under the GRASS GIS
tool. To come back to the same menu in the visualization tool, type <EM>return</EM> and hit enter.
<p>
<EM>11. Quit</EM>: This option takes the user back to the initial screen (Figure 1).
If the user has created any maps using option 6, the program asks if these 
are to be saved before quiting.
