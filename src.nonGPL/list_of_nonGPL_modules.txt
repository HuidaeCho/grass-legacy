List of potential Non-GPL'able code in GRASS 5:  18. December 1999

------------------------------

The entire r.le suite of programs including:
r.le.dist/
r.le.setup/
r.le.patch/
r.le.trace/
r.le.pixel/
-> not (yet) included in 5.0, upgrade forthcoming in 1/2000
(Note from Bill Baker to Markus Neteler 12/99)

------------------------------

SDTS code was release to CERL and GRASS.
-> should be o.k.
------------------------------

The FIPS library is USGS and therefore should
be public domain.
-> o.k.
------------------------------

r.nntool contains code from the NETS back
propogation neural network simulator.  The
neural network engine and headers were
incorporated into the tool.  Developed by NASA
and released into the public-domain.
-> not in 5.0, but o.k. anyway
------------------------------

r.out.mpeg may have applicable code that is
copyright by Berkeley.
-> not a problem as "mpeg_encode" is not distributed
   withing GRASS 5 (but in src.related in GRASS 4.x!)

------------------------------

f-tools use HEC format from WES.  No problem
as HEC tools are public-domain.
-> o.k.
------------------------------

ogl3d/ modules use SGI libes.  Are they proprietary?
-> not included in GRASS 5

ogl3d_linux/ is based on openGL-clone MESA

------------------------------

src.contrib/CERL/SGI - applicable copyrights to SGI
OpenGL.
-> are you shure? Can't find anything!

src.contrib/CERL/SGI/panel/
 -> public domain from NASA
------------------------------

CWU Census scripts by CWU.
src/mapdev/v.apply.census/
-> ?
Isn't Census a governmental organization?

------------------------------
/src.contrib/NMSU/WRAT - Cook College Remote Sensing 
Center holds copyright? No notice at all. CERL contract?
-> moved to src.nonGPL.

------------------------------
grasslinks
-> not in GRASS 5

src.contrib/UCB/gdbase are copyright by the Regents of Berkeley in Ca.
-> no copyright notice
