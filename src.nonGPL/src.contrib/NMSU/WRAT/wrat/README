NAME   wrat   ( Water Resource Assessment Tool ) 
 
SYNOPSIS: WRAT is an interactive module for evaluating water 
          resources. It contains a section for terrain analysis,
 
          a section for runoff simulation and a section for 
          modeling runoff quality.  
 
   WRAT was developed to address water related issues in
watersheds of mixed landuse in watersheds from a few square miles
to approximately 100 square miles. It combines ideas from both
agricultural models and urban models. The results are not
absolute predictors of contaminant levels in the water column. As
an assessment tool these simulations differentiate between areas
and events and with careful interpretation allow the ranking of
areas and subwatersheds for comparison.  
 
   The module is highly interactive and menu driven. Work is
organized into projects. A file for each project keeps track of
progress to date and the names of the most recent input and
product maps. The following paragraphs summarize each of the
sections. For a full explanation consult the tutorial. 
 
   TERRAIN ANALYSIS: Routing of water and contaminants requires a
coherent path, or set of directions, through watersheds for every
cell. The terrain analysis requires a digital elevation model as
input. It produces an idealized elevation model, drainage
direction maps and drainage accumulation maps. These use the same
codes for output as those produced by r.watershed, however the
algorithms are quite different. A slope map is produced using the
GRASS slope.aspect function.  
 
    HYDROLOGY: Runoff is based on the Soil Conservation's curve
number method. It requires a map of hydrologic soil group and a
land cover map. Users may provide a one day design storm, or a
map of a real rainfall event. Users must also provide the
antecedent moisture condition. Output is a map of the depth of
runoff from each cell in 100ths of an inch. 
    A second hydrologic simulation models peak discharge. This
requires a runoff map, the drainage direction and accumulation
maps and the idealized elevation map. Output is a map of all peak
discharges greater then 1 cfs.  
 
    QUALITY: Simulations of contaminant source areas require a
land cover map, maps of soil texture, and soil erodibility K
factor, a slope map and a runoff map. Users must provide the
number of dry days since the last major storm. Production of
sediment, nitrogen, phosphorous and chemical oxygen demand (COD)
are modeled to produce individual maps of contaminant source
areas (mass per unit area)  Routing routines can process these
source area maps to provide maps of contaminant generated above
that point in the watershed. Optional best management maps may be
applied during routing. These indicate the % of each contaminant
removed from the flow as it passes that raster cell. 
 
   A general accumulation function is also provided. "ga" adds
the values of any map down through the watersheds. it requires a
drainage direction map, drainage accumulation map and input map. 
 
 
 
TYPICAL ANALYSIS:  Experience with these models suggests that a
useful approach follows this general path. Model typical design
storms, those expected once a month and once a year. Smaller
storms may produce no surface runoff and larger storms may exceed
the valid ranges of empirical relationships used in the models.
In regions containing significant portions of urban areas, model
both wet and dry antecedent moisture conditions. Follow the
contaminant module through the routing of contaminants. Employ
the general accumulation program to sum the runoff maps for those
modeled storms. Then sample those maps at the outflows of
subwatersheds. Subwatersheds may be compared using the ratios
between contaminants and drainage area, the ratios between
accumulated contaminants and total runoff volume and the ratio of
runoff to area. 
 
Subwatershed maps (developed elsewhere) may be reclassified to
show the relative rankings of streams. Small differences in
contaminant to runoff ratios are probably insignificant.
