.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBGsurface input\fR\*=\fIname\fR \fBoutput\fR\*=\fIname\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIGsurface\fR fills a grid cell matrix with interpolated values generated
from a set of irregularly spaced data points using numerical
approximation (weighted averaging) techniques. The interpolated
value of a cell is determined by values of nearby data points
and the distance of the cell from those input points.
In comparison with other methods, numerical
approximation allows representation of more complex surfaces
(particularly those with anomalous features), restricts the spatial
influence of any errors, and generates the interpolated surface from the
data points. It is the most appropriate method to apply to most spatial data.
.LP
The command line input is as follows:
.IP \fBinput\fR 8
grid cell map that contains a set of irregularly spaced data values.
(i.e., some grid cells contain known data values while the rest
contain zero (0)).
.IP \fBoutput\fR
grid cell map that represents a smooth surface generated from the known
data values in the input layer.
.SH NOTES
The amount of memory used by this program is related to the number of
non-zero data values in the input map.
If the input map is very dense, ie, contains a lot of non-zero data points,
the program may not be able to get all the memory it needs from the system.
The time required to execute increases with the number of input data points.
