This fascinating code uses the GRASS 3.0 graphics programming utilities in
a clever way.  The user interfaces with screen menus.   The contents and
behavior of the menus is driven largely by the instructions in range.rc .

The data operations are not up to date, but the method for generating 
the menus is interesting and could be applied to other applications.

It is hoped however that X based interfaces will be used for this purpose 
in the future.
