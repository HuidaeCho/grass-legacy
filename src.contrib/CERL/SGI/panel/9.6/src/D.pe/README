This is the source code for the Panel Editor, pe, which is a neat
program that allows you to create and move actuators and panels.  Pe
also lets you load existing executables and mess with their controls,
and then dump the result.

You may notice that there is something missing from this source
release, like, for example, the source code.  That's because it isn't
quite ready.  I have a bet with the developer (for $10 American) that
it won't be done by the end of April.  He says it will.  We shall see.

You will be notified when the software is ready.
