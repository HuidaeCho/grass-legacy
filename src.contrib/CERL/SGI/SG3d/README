This code written by Dave Gerdes  USA-CERL   1990

This program is written for the GL language on Silicon Graphics 4D 
workstations.  It is an interactive program to display 3D (2.5D) GRASS
data.

It requires that the panel library be compiled before compiling this
program.


Usage:

SG3d elev.file color.file [vector.file]
    or
SG3d elev.file Red.file Green.file Blue.file [vector.file]


*** One usage note:   after loading, you need to use the Z Scale buttons
to get the image in the view screen.  This is a multiplier that allows for
data where the Z values are not in the same scale as the X and Y values.
It is still rather buggy, and needs to be improved.


    Although this code is released to the Public Domain, it is considered
sleazy and in bad taste to take credit for other programmer's work.
I request that due credit be given to the original author in this, and
all other GRASS related software, or any derivative works.  This should 
go without saying, but I have seen my name replaced with the name of one 
alleged sleazy programmer on the author line of several of my programs.
