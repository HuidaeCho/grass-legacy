NOTE that the Panel library must first be compiled.
This is in:
	src.contrib/CERL/SGI/panel/9.6/src
	simply type 'make' in that directory 
	(you may need to make changes to Makefile.defs in that directory)

ALSO, the Image library must be compiled.
This is in: 
	src.contrib/CERL/SGI/libimage
	also type 'make' in that directory 



When compiling under IRIX 3.x, you *must* comment out the line:
    #define FOUR_OH 
in the externs.h file.  

If compiling under IRIX 4.0 and above, the line must exist and not be
commented out.
    (this is the default)
