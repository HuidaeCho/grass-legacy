The tutorial file is formatted to be printed on a laser printer using:
 
      itroff -ms tutorial  

The file 'man' is a GRASS manual page that can be printed using:

      itroff -man man

The files "catman" and "cat.tutorial" are nroff'd versions of the above
that can be viewed with cat or more.

The demo.script file is a demo SG3d script created in the spearfish 
database with the default region.  To start the script, start GRASS and
set the default region in spearfish.  Put the demo.script file in the 
current directory and type the GRASS command:

SG3d elevation.dem co=elevation.dem vect=roads script=demo.script site=bugsites

The script is a loop, so to stop the script either click on 'Quit' and exit
the program or pop up the Script... panel and click on 'stop read'.
