This library must be compiled before compiling SG3d.

This source code comes from Paul Haeberli at SGI.
It is distributed with all SGI computers in 
/usr/people/4Dgifts/iristools/libimage.
We include it here as a convenience to GRASS users.

This library allows SG3d to save images from the graphics window 
in .rgb files, the IRIS image format.

ipaste, movie, snapshot, istat, showcase, imged.

See also file format conversion programs:
tops, togif, tosun, toscitex, totarga, toppm, etc.
