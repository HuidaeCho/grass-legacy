  The program hit_diag is used to test a Hitachi digitizer.
  There shouldn't be any need for it unless there are problems or you wish to
  expand the capabilities of this system and do your own testing.

  For more information on the digitizer commands read the file INSTALL in the
  directory above.

 Berkley ( Sun's):
	Compile the program with the command:   'make -f makeberk'.

 System V (Any AT&T machine, Intergraph):
	Compile the program with the command:   'make -f makeatt'.


 To run the program after compiling it type 'hit_diag'.  You must know
 which tty the digitizer is connected to.
 The program 'hit_diag'  will show raw coordinates from the digitizer on
 an ascii terminal.  It will also show what digitizer cursor buttons are
 being pressed.  If the digitizer can't even be opened then it means that the
 cabling, the tty or the digitizer is not setup properly.
