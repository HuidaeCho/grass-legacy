/*
 * Start up graphics processing.  Anything that needs to be assigned, set up,
 * started-up, or otherwise initialized happens here.  This is called only at
 * the startup of the graphics driver.
 *
 * The external variables define the pixle limits of the graphics surface.  The
 * coordinate system used by the applications programs has the (0,0) origin
 * in the upper left-hand corner.  Hence,
 *    SCREEN_LEFT < SCREEN_RIGHT
 *    SCREEN_TOP  < SCREEN_BOTTOM 
 *
 * NCOLORS is set to the total number of colors available on the device.  This
 * most certainly needs to be more than 100 (or so).  If you are writing a
 * driver with fewer colors you probably need to provide your own Color(),
 * Color_table_float(), Color_table_fixed(), and
 * Reset_color() routines (see ../lib/{Color.c,Reset_clr.c,Clr_table.c}).
