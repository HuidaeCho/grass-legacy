Hello,

I'm involved in generating applications (medical image processing) for
researchers in the University of Turku. The xgen program seems to be
ideal for generating simple applications. However I've had some
troubles in writing the scripts, the system behaves oddly or crashes
(I'm using a Sun 386i with SunOS 4.0.1). Eg. in the demo application
some of the 'label' objects do not appear at all. 

If You have any patches or additional documents about the xgen I would
be very grateful to receive those.

My address is
