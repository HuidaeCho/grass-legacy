NAME
     ipw.to.grass - Converts IPW image file to GRASS raster map layer
     (GRASS Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     ipw.to.grass
     ipw.to.grass help
     ipw.to.grass [ipw=name] map=name [mask=name] [multiplier=value] \
               [offset=value]

DESCRIPTION

     ipw.to.grass converts a single-band image file in IPW (Image
     Processing Workbench) format to a GRASS raster map layer.
     If an IPW image is not specified, standard input will be
     used.

     The current region in GRASS must have the same number of
     rows and columns (as shown by g.region -p) as the IPW
     image has lines and samples, respectively.  If the IPW
     input file contains a geodetic header, the geographic
     boundaries and resolutions must match, or a warning will
     be issued and the GRASS values will be used.

     If an IPW image is specified as a mask, all cells in the 
     GRASS map layer corresponding to the zero ("no data") values
     in the mask will be set to zero, regardless of the value
     in the IPW input image.

     Since GRASS cell values are integers, IPW image floating
     point values will be truncated to integer values, i.e.
     29.2 and 29.9 will both be set to 29 in the resulting
     GRASS cell file.  A multiplier and/or offset may be
     specified to convert the input IPW floating point pixel
     values to the GRASS integer values.  If both a multiplier
     and offset are specified, the data are first multiplied
     by the multiplier, then the offset will be added.


     Parameters:

     ipw=name            IPW input image (defaults to standard input)
     map=name            output GRASS cell file
     mask=name           IPW mask image
     multiplier=value    multiply IPW datum by value (before offset)
                         default: 1.0
     offset=value        add to map datum (after multiplication)
                         default: 0.0

EXAMPLES

     The following command,

              ipw.to.grass ipw=ipwfile map=grasslayer multiplier=10.0 \
                        offset=100.0

     will convert an IPW image called ipwfile to a GRASS map
     layer called  grasslayer, multiplying all input values by 10
     then adding 100 before storing in the GRASS output file.

     In the following command,

              demux -b 0 ipw.img | ipw.to.grass map=grass.out \
                  mask=ipwmask offset=0.5

     the IPW command demux is used to extract band 0 from a mult-band
     IPW image file and feed it as input to ipw.to.grass.  The data are
     masked by the IPW mask image ipwmask and 0.5 is added to non-masked
     data to cause rounding to the nearest integer, rather than
     truncating.

     To convert an N-band IPW image into N GRASS cell files:

             demux -b 1 ipwfile | ipw.to.grass o=cell.1
                     ...
             demux -b N ipwfile | ipw.to.grass o=cell.N
