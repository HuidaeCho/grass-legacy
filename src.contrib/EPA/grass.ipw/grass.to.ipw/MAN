NAME
     grass.to.ipw - Converts GRASS raster map layer to IPW image file 
     (GRASS Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     grass.to.ipw
     grass.to.ipw help
     grass.to.ipw [-r] map=name [header=name] [units=name] \
               [divisor=value] [offset=value]

DESCRIPTION

     grass.to.ipw converts a GRASS raster map layer to an IPW
     (Image Processing Workbench) image file.  The GRASS map
     data is resampled (if its geographic region or resolution
     differs from the currently defined region - see g.region),
     and masked by the GRASS current mask.   The IPW image is 
     written to the standard output.

     If an IPW header file is specified, the values in the given
     header will be used for the number of bits per pixel, and
     the linear quantization (floating point map).  The IPW
     header may optionally be specified as stdin.  The number
     of lines and samples in the given header must match the
     number of rows and columns in the currently defined GRASS
     region (see g.region -p).  If the -r flag is also specified,
     the given linear quantization header will be written to the
     output image, but the data values will be copied as raw pixel
     values, bypassing the floating point mapping.

     If no IPW header file is specified, the number of bits per
     pixel will be set large enough to hold the maximum data
     value in the GRASS map layer, i.e. N bits where N is the
     lowest integer such that 2**N - 1 is greater than the
     maximum data value in the GRASS map layer.  The linear
     quantization mapping will be defined so that there is a
     1:1 mapping of the integer data values.  If the -r (raw)
     flag is specified, then no linear quantization header will
     be output to the IPW image.

     A divisor and/or offset may be specified for conversion of
     the integer GRASS data values to IPW floating point values.
     If both are specified, the offset will be added to the data
     first, and then the result will be divided by the given
     divisor before storing in the IPW output image.

     If a units parameter is specified, the given units name will
     be stored in the "units =" line of the lq (linear quantization)
     header of the output IPW image file.


     Flags:
     -r                  raw values (don't convert to linear quantization)

     Parameters:

     map=name            input GRASS cell file
     header=name         input linear quantization header file
     units=name          data units for annotation
     divisor=value       divide each map data by this value
                         default: 1.0
     offset=value        add to each map data (prior to division)
                         default: 0.0

EXAMPLES


     The following command,

              grass.to.ipw map=grasslayer divisor=10.0 offset=-100.0 \
			> ipwfile

     will convert a GRASS map layer called  grasslayer to an IPW
     image file called ipwfile, subtracting 100.0 from all input
     values then dividing the result by 10.0 before storing in the
     IPW output file.

     The following pipeline of commands,

            mkbih -l 200 -s 500 -f | mklqh -m 0,0,255,1.275 -f \
                 | grass.to.ipw -r map=rawlayer > image

     creates an 8-bit IPW image of 200 lines and 500 samples with
     linear floating point mapping defined by the pairs (0,0) and
     (255,1.275).  The data values in GRASS cell file rawlayer are
     copied as raw pixel values, so that a value of 200 in input map
     layer grasslayer is copied as raw value 200 in the IPW image,
     and will be mapped to floating point value of 1.0.

     To convert several GRASS cell files into a multi-band IPW image:
             grass.to.ipw map=cell.1 > ipw.1
                     ...
             grass.to.ipw map=cell.N > ipw.N
             mux ipw.1 ... ipw.N > image
