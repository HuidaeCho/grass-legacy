GRASS has an undocumented capability that allows a user to run a startup
file automatically every time GRASS is started.  This is akin to a .cshrc
or .login file (for csh users) or a .profile (for sh users).  This directory
contains startup files that have been generated for different sites.  You
may want to use them for ideas.

If the file .grass3rc is found inthe users home directory it is EXECUTED.  If
it is not found, but there is a grass3rc file in the $GISBASE directory, that
file is executed.  The later is reserved as a default for all users at a given
site.

Samples in this directory:

suntool.st   Developed for a site which runs one single user SUN graphics
             monitor.   At GRASS startup, suntools is automatically started
             up (if not already running).  An accompanying suntools startup
             file creates an appropriate window in which the SUN (core)
             driver is started.   The script then checks after a pause to
             make sure the driver is running and reports to the user
             accordingly.
