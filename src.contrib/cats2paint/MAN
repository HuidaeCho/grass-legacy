.SH NAME
cats2paint - create paint "legend" for a cell file, using
cell category and color information.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This module creates a paint labels file from the category and color information
associated with a cell file. The label file can then be used in paint
as a legend that is drawn on the map instead of below it.
The legend will have color boxes followed by a text labels. The colors
will correspond to the cell colors for each category.

The user specifies the cell file from which to extract the category label
and color information, and a labels file to hold the result.
Since the labels file as an entity itself forms a legend, the user
also specifies the size and placement of the legend, as follows:
