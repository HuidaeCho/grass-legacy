World coast-line projection program.  The user can display any part of the
globe in any of several projections.

This code was extracted off a tape thrown away about 1980.  It has no
documentation either in the directories or in the source code.  Seems
that there was some indication that this was possibly an implementation
of the original CIA World Data Base.  Note that the data is byte order
dependent (see below).

To compile for use in a GRASS graphics window:  run make in this directory.
  This will compile a library of projection routines in the directory "proj"
  and then link the library with some routines in this directory creating
  the executable "Wmap".   Compiler error messages abound.

To create world pictures:
  Run GRASS as usual at your site.
  Start your favorite "monitor".
  Select the monitor.
  Create a grahics window on the monitor (e.g. run Dscreen)
  Choose (Dchoose) the graphics window.
  Run "Wmap" piping its output into "Dgraph".

For starters, run any of the following commands:
 Mercator projection of world -
	Wmap  mercator -g 5 -d 1  | Dgraph
 Orthogonal projection of world -
	Wmap  orthographic -g 20 -d 35 -o 35 55 0 | Dgraph
 Albers equal area of North America -
	Wmap  albers  40 50 -g 1  -o 90 85 0 -d 1 -l 20 60 60 130 | Dgraph
 Albers equal area of Carribean -
	Wmap  albers  40 50 -g 10  -o 90 85 0 -d 1 -l 10 30 70 90 | Dgraph
 Mercator projection of South America -
	Wmap mercator -g 30  -o 90 85 0 -d 10 -l -60 -30 30 90 | Dgraph
 Albers equal area of Great Lakes region -
	Wmap  albers  40 50 -g 1 1 -o 90 85 0 -d 1 -l 40 50 80 90 | Dgraph

If these result in garbage, you may have to reverse the byte order of the
data.   Wmap uses the data in usr/dict/world.  You may try to replace this
file with usr/dict/world.new.   Note that usr/dict/world.x is also used, but is
an ascii index into usr/dict/world.

Documentation?  None found.  The only help available is obtained by simply
running:
   Wmap   -or-
   Wmap help

Core dumps are not unusual, but the occasional interesting picture is worth
the time.
