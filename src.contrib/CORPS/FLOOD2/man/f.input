f.input

This tool reads the results of the HEC-2 Water Surface Profile model and generates a
vector map of water surface elevations at hydraulic sections.  The user supplies to
f.input a vector map of the hydraulic cross sections used in the HEC-2 model along with
the HEC-2 model results.

The results of f.input, a vector map, is generally uninteresting to the user and is
intended to be used only as input to the f.wsurf program.  The functionality of f.input
and f.wsurf could have been combined into a single tool but was separated out because of
the intense CPU requirements of f.wsurf.  This functional separation allows the user to
process single flood events through f.wsurf.

In the input vector map, cross sections must be labeled with the same section numbers as
were used in the HEC-2 model.  These section numbers must be unique within the integer
portion of the id.

It is not necessary for all cross sections from the HEC-2 model to appear in the GRASS
map or vice versa.  Vector cross sections are not used in the HEC-2 model will be
assigned to a water surface elevation to zero by f.input.  Modeled cross sections which
are not in the vector map will be ignored by f.input.

The user specify to f.input the flood events represented in the HEC-2 output file.  The
order in which the user specifies the flood events must correspond to the order in which
the events were modeled in HEC-2.  Events are specified in terms of their recurrence
interval and may be specified interactively or through the use of a control file. 
Enumeration of recurrence intervals is important to subsequent economic calculations
performed in f.econ.

Split flow conditions which have been modeled as two separate HEC-2 model runs yielding
two HEC-2 output files is supported by f.input.  However, the vector sections for both
the primary and split flow runs should appear in a single GRASS map.

Only one split flow file is allowed, and f.input assumes that the flood events modeled
for the split flow are the same as those modeled in the primary HEC-2 run.  

Any cross section which is modeled in both the primary and split flow HEC-2 runs may have
two different water surface elevations calculated by HEC-2.  When generating the vector
map of water surface elevations, f.input will overwrite the primary water surface
elevation with the elevation in the split flow file.

GRASS maps can only contain integer values.  In order to maintain one-tenth foot
precision in the floodplain analysis data, water surface elevations calculated by HEC-2
are multiplied by 10 before being assigned to the GRASS vector maps.  This multiplication
factor is accommodated by other f-tools.
