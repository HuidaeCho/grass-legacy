OGL3D/Linux compliant 8/1999

Compiling OGL3d:
  Please check compile_libGLw.txt on requirements.

Linux binaries:
The binary works with grass4.2.1, I have not tried it with 5.0 I compiled it 
with RedHat 5.2, XFree86 3.3.3.1, Mesa3.0, and Lesstif 0.88.9. Be sure that 
you have compiled Mesa as shared libs and that libGlw, found under the 
widgets-sgi subdirectory of the main Mesa dist is also compiled as a shared 
lib. Copy the ogl3d executable to 
YOUR_GRASS_DIRECTORY/linux/etc/bin/contrib/cmd and the app-defaults file to 
linux/etc/app-defaults. Then run Makelinks and you are ready to go.

Example:
cp ogl3d /usr/local/grass-5.0b/etc/bin/contrib/cmd
mkdir /usr/local/grass-5.0b/etc/app-defaults
cp ogl3d-appdef /usr/local/grass-5.0b/etc/app-defaults/ogl3d

GRASS 5 users: You can use:
/usr/local/bin/gmakelinks5 
("src/CMD/Makelinks.sh" does not exist any more)
If not existing, create it like this:
------- cut here --------------------
:
GISBASE=/usr/local/grass-5.0b
SRC=/opt/src5/grass5.0beta/src
CMD=/opt/src5/grass5.0beta/src/CMD
. /opt/src5/grass5.0beta/src/CMD/generic/MAKELINKS.sh
------- cut here --------------------


A couple of things to remember. Your display must be set to 16-bit color 
minimum. Color selection is broken except for surface color. Setting the 
wire color works if you choose the "use surface color" option. The animation 
panel is unfinished, but it does work. Sites files MUST be loaded from the 
command line or else you get a seg-fault if you try to open a sites file 
from the file selection box.

To start the program, type ogl3d at the command line. At the first prompt, 
type the name of an elevation layer and keep hitting enter until the main 
window comes up. Please let me know if you have any problems.

I will send you the source code to ogl3d when I get back home next. I forgot 
to bring the latest version with me this time.

Oct 1995 - alpha & omega release of "ogl3d" for GRASS4.1

Due to requests for OpenGL code, we're releasing this UNSUPPORTED
version of a GRASS visualization program using OpenGL.

This was our first attempt at converting SG3d to OpenGL.  We
completely rewrote the interface using Motif and added support 
for multiple objects.  This version is somewhat buggy - mostly 
things like default settings being off (especially for lighting - 
you always need to adjust), colors being allocated and hogged, etc., 
but probably also an occasional core dump - don't even try the
clipping planes panel, it WILL crash in this version.  

There is an app.defaults file here which should be copied to 
$(GISBASE)/etc/app-defaults/ogl3d by the gmake process.  
Be sure to run MAKELINKS after compiling with gmake4.1.

We are NOT SUPPORTING this version.  We have since migrated most of
this code to GRASS 4.2 or 5.0 or whatever it's going to be called,
re-wrote the interface again to use TCL/TK and went back to
IRIS GL instead of OpenGL until we can find or write an OpenGL widget for
TCL/TK.

The only platforms we have with OpenGL are SGIs, so we've only
compiled and tested it for SGI.  I think the main thing you should
probably look at in the cmd/Gmakefile if you're using OpenGL on another 
platform is the library: 

    -lGLw  
    
The only routine from this used is GLwCreateMDrawingArea, which creates
the Motif widget with an OpenGL drawing area.  This is likely to be 
non-standard and vendor specific.  The files to look at are cmd/GLx.c
and cmd/primary_controls.c 

You also need to have the OpenGL Utility library:

    -lGLU

All the drawing code is in a library called libgsf in the directory gsf.

If you haven't compiled GRASS4.1 this won't compile, and I can't 
help you.  It also uses the library libXgi.a from xgrass, so you
may need to compile the xgrass libraries first (in src/xgrass/libes).

While you're welcome to send bug reports to me, I probably won't respond
and I won't try to fix them in this version - chances are they've 
already been fixed in our current work.  I can not help you find a 
replacement for GLwCreateMDrawingArea - you'll just have to try to 
find example code for your platform.  I am very interested in hearing
SUCCESS stories, however; if you're compiling on non-SGIs and get
something working, try to document it and send me the fixes so I can
make it available to others using the same platform.

There is no user documentation for this version.  The closest thing
is a document under construction for our current work describing the
TCL/TK version at: http://www.cecer.army.mil/grass/viz/nviz.html

Good Luck - 

- Bill
