You need X11 and Motif in order to compile this program!

Things I'd like to do if I get time:

1) Enable the use of TrueColor for displays that support it, instead of
   just 256 colors.

2) Allow the overlaying of vector files.

3) Add a "save as MPEG" button.

4) Spend 3 months on an Island in the South Pacific.

For usage info, see html/html/xganim.html
