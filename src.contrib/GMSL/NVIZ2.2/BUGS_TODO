Subject: [NVIZ] NVIZ-todo-bugs-problems

I am testing the LINUX version of NVIZ thouroughly
and here are some of my findings, so that you don't have to wonder
why some things don't work as expected.
Don't get discouraged by the long list, the NVIZ is still great
and I got a lot done with it for my presentation at GISC2000 -
it just needs continuing improvements.

(Markus, this is updated from what I gave you before.)

NVIZ2.2 runs pretty well on LINUX, however there are several 
things which are 

1. missing/not working which worked in SGI version
-------------------------------------------------
1.0 For certain combination of zscale and resolution the surface
does not render completely (only its parts), you have to lower
zscale to get it render completely - this may be caused by
limits in OPENGL or the integer normals issue (see problem 1.2)

1.1 Scripting is not there at all, if I remember correctly
it did not work in the SGI OpenGL version but it worked very well
in the original SGI version - it is a powerful tool for 
doing complex animations (especially if you know tcl/tk,
but even if you don't know it the tutorial and GUI is good enough
to be able to some advanced dynamic visualization.
Does anybody know where the script_tools are?

Error in startup script: couldn't read file "script_tools": no such file or directory

1.2  The lights do not work if the surface values are floating point
between 0.0 - 1.0 - this was fixed in SGI version and I believe that it
was due to the fact that the surface normals were computed as integers.
It is still possible to view a surface with small numbers by using high
value of ambient light, however the lighting and shading won't be there.
With very small numbers or values stretching over several magnitudes
you have to adjust the height of view by typing in the numbers to get
it right - this is not a bug though.

1.3 nviz2.2 -q 
is looking for a -q map, 

WARNING: unable to find [-q] in [(null)]
WARNING: unable to open raster map [-q in (null)]
Not able to open cellfile for [-q]

but then it opens as if it had -q map
it should not be doing this, this flag is
for running it without any input - it is needed for running scripts
and when using load state.

it does the same with -help

1.4 when mask is removed it still draws a hole there
but otherwise the mask seems to be working OK.

1.5 After hitting the maximum site files loaded, it correctly displays
an error but then hangs-on with "please wait" (probably trying
to load them - it should return back where it was
and not attempt to load)

1.6 Most of you have probably already experienced the following feature:
for a mysterious reason the rendered image is occasionally replaced by the 
grid mesh image - on SGI it happened when you moved the mouse accross
the height or zscale slide, but on LINUX it happens even more often, We
spent quite a bit of time with Bill trying to find out what it is
with no success. Whoever fixes this should win a prize.

2. things which were in SG3d but were never ported to nviz
----------------------------------------------------------

2.1 Legends, labels, including labels for sites
2.2 Scale, north
2.3 More options for display of sites based on their attributes

3. Experimental capabilities for combining volumes and surfaces in sg4d
----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 Integration of r3.showdspf with surface visualization

other than that it runs great so far - although I haven't yet tried
everything
