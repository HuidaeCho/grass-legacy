Brook,

may I ask you for sed syntax again?

I have following script piece:
grass5.0beta/src.contrib/GMSL/NVIZ2.2/configure
[...]

set panel_path=${install_dir}/scripts
set panel_path=cho "$panel_path" | sed 's/\//\\\//g'
set bit_maps=cho
"$bit_maps" | sed 's/\//\\\//g'
'rm' -rf scripts/config.tcl
sed -e "\
s/default_panel_path=sed/default_panel_path ${panel_path}/g;\
s/bit_map_path=sed/bit_map_path ${bit_maps}/g\
" scripts/config.tcl.in > scripts/config.tcl

The script replaces a string in config.tcl.in for the
NVIZ path. I want this path relative, at time it is  
absolute (which may cause problems at installation if
installing to a different path).

So I want to print $(GISBASE)/ before ${install_dir}
like:
set panel_path=$(GISBASE)/${install_dir}/scripts

How to manage this? It always thinks $(GISBASE) is a variable
to be interpreted!

Thanks in advance

 Markus
