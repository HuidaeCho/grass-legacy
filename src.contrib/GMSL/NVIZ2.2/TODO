NVIZ TODOs:

  - The second issue is with the error you report above when entering a
    vertical exag. manually.  The error that you are getting is a TCL error. 
    To try and get a decent vertical exaggeration you should try manually
    setting is as you were doing above above. Because you are dealing with
    such small numbers you may have to enter the value a couple of times
    before it is accepted. The reason for this is that TCL want to use a
    value that is a multiple of the scale-bar resolution.  The resolution
    should be reset to match the value you have entered -- it is this
    calculation that is generating the error (I think) that you describe
    above.

  - nviz does not work well with latitude-longitude projections because it
    uses decimal degrees instead of metres for the resolution. Thus is why
    the vertical exaggeration is such a small number.

  - Z axis scalable when displaying 3D sites
    (Being worked on by ?)

  - eventually color problem in lat/long locations
    (Being worked on by ?)

  - high resolution output (definable extent like CELL driver)
    (Being worked on by 
     probably Bob Covill <bcovill@tekmap.ns.ca>)

  - fix legend, scale and box drawings
    (Being worked on by Bill Brown, Helena Mitasova)

  - have immediate refresh of surface/vectors etc. instead of manual
    redrawing
