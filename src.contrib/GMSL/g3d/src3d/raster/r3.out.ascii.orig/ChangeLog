	* main.c: Added support for handling null values.  The user may
	specify a string to be output when null values are detected.  The
	default is an asterisk (i.e. "*").

	* main.c: Added the -h flag which allows the user to suppress the
	output of header information.

	(main): Modified output so that if no output file is specified
	then the output goes to stdout instead.

	* main.c: Changed the entire source file to be in ansi standard
	form.  I really hate k&r code.

	(main): Finished version which just outputs header info.  Next I
	will work on getting the layers read in correctly and outputing
	them in a format which can be read by r3.in.ascii.

	* main.c: Start of r3.out.ascii.  Basically I'm just modifying
	Roman's r3.in.ascii code with a few additional features.  No big
	deal.
