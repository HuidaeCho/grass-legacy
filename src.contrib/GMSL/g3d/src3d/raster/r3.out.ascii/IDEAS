Yes, that's a good idea.  I won't have time to look at it,                      
but I think using G3d_getValue instead of G3d_getValueRegion,                   
is suppose to use "window-coordinates" instead of absolute                      
row,col,depth from the file.  I think the file is opened                        
correctly and should be using the current window, but                           
G3d_getRegionStructMap should be replaced with                                  
G3d_readWindow (&region, NULL) or G3d_getWindow (&region)                       
and G3d_getCoordsMap should be replaced - I guess just                          
get the dimensions from the region structure itself.                            
                                                                                
It might also be worth considering using G3d_useWindowParams.
