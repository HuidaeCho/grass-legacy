MESA3.2 does not have a workig Makefile for the required
SGI widgets. Here you find the Makefile to compile
Mesa-3.2/widgets-sgi properly.

Store the file
  Makefile.X11
in
  Mesa-3.2/widgets-sgi
and compile.

Please read ../README.mesa31

Then you should be able to compile r3.showdspf.openGL.

Have fun.
