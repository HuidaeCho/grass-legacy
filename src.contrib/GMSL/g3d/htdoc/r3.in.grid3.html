Imports files in Bill Brown's <EM>grid3</EM> format into G3D.
<P>
The command line argument <EM>nv</EM> specifies whether zeros in the grid3 file
are converted to NULL-values. Conversion is performed if the value is 
<EM>yes</EM>. The default is <EM>no</EM>.
<P>
The arguments <EM>type</EM>, <EM>precision</EM>, <EM>compression</EM>, and
<EM>tiledimension</EM> are the standard g3d arguments which allow the user
to overwrite the default properties of the new file. Note that the 
<EM>none</EM> value for <EM>compression</EM> only specifies that neither
<EM>LZW</EM> nor <EM>RLE</EM> is used for compression. It does not turn
off the compression all together. G3d does not support non-compressed files.
<P>
<EM>r3.in.grid3</EM> uses <EM>float</EM> as default cell-<EM>type</EM>.
<P>
NOTE: Currently, after the file has been imported, the stored values are 
compared with the original data. This feature is used to find bugs in the
library at an early stage and will be turned off as soon as confidence has
built up.
