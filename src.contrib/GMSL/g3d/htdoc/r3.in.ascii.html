Imports files in <EM>3d</EM> <EM>ascii</EM> format into G3D.
<P>
The command line argument <EM>nv</EM> specifies which value to 
converted to NULL-value. If the specified value is <EM>none</EM>, no
conversion is performed. The default is <EM>none</EM>.
<P>
The arguments <EM>type</EM>, <EM>precision</EM>, <EM>compression</EM>, and
<EM>tiledimension</EM> are the standard g3d arguments which allow the user
to overwrite the default properties of the new file. Note that the 
<EM>none</EM> value for <EM>compression</EM> only specifies that neither
<EM>LZW</EM> nor <EM>RLE</EM> is used for compression. It does not turn
off the compression all together. G3d does not support non-compressed files.
<P>
The format for the ascii file:
<PRE>
north: <EM>floating point</EM>
south: <EM>floating point</EM>
east: <EM>floating point</EM>
west: <EM>floating point</EM>
top: <EM>floating point</EM>
bottom: <EM>floating point</EM>
rows: <EM>integer</EM>
cols: <EM>integer</EM>
levels: <EM>integer</EM>
</PRE>
This header is followed by the cell values in <EM>floating point</EM> format 
organized in rows with constant <EM>col</EM> and <EM>level</EM> coordinate.
The rows are organized by constant <EM>level</EM> coordinate. Individual cell
values are separated by <EM>space</EM> or <EM>CR</EM>.
<P>
NOTE: Currently, after the file has been imported, the stored values are 
compared with the original data. This feature is used to find bugs in the
library at an early stage and will be turned off as soon as confidence has
built up.
