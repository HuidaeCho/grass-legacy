Here's a set of sample data files to test sg4d.

I think you should be able to view them by creating an x-y
location with WIND as default WIND, then make a surface using
mapcalc and start up sg4d, then load the 3d files from the 
"Options" panel.

First I'd suggest playing with showdspf, since the command
line interface for showdspf is what you get in sg4d when you
pick "Options..." "set dspf parameters".

Just a couple of quick hints to get you started with showdspf -

 *  Z# exaggerates verticle direction by #.  For this data set,
    Z5 works pretty good.

 *  r - lets you rotate the volume using the leftmouse 
    down in the graphics window. rightmouse click to set.

 *  I think the best way to see the isosurfaces is to toggle
    the clear flag ( C ), then hit +++++ <return> a few times

You might also try making some new dspf files from the grid3
by using mkdspf.
