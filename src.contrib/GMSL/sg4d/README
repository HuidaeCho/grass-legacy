Subject: sg4d                                                                   

sg4d runs only on SGI,                       
it is a GRASS4.1 (no FP) and for 3D is uses the old grid3                       
format which stored the data outside GRASS database.                            
It was a messy way how to do things, however we just tried                      
to prove a concept. The source code may be useful to see                        
how the interaction between the 2D and volume data was handled,                 
especially the issues of vertical rescaling, light, etc. 

-------------------------------------------

Also see the README in 3Ddata.  

I compiled sg4d & the needed libes in showd and showd/libe under IRIX 5.2 
& left the libes for you.  The executables are in bin.  
(Only sg4d is IRIX5.2, others are IRIX4.0.5 but seem to run OK).

good luck -
