WARNING:  If you've been using older versions of SG3d to create
panel scripts, the old panel scripts won't work with this version.
When buttons are added, it messes up the numbering system used in 
the scripts.  So you may want to save your old version of SG3d 
somewhere or else remake the panel scripts with the new version.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
TO INSTALL THE BINARY:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	1) If you already have an older version of SG3d that you 
	want to replace, it should be in $GISBASE/etc/bin/contrib/cmd -
	so just copy the new binary over it.  e.g., 
	cp SG3d.irix405 $GISBASE/etc/bin/contrib/cmd/SG3d
	
	2) If you don't currently have SG3d, you should copy the binary
	to the correct directory, as above, AND then make a link to
	the GRASS bin direstory: ln $GISBASE/etc/front.end $GISBASE/bin/SG3d

---------------------------------------------------------------------
TO COMPILE:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE that the Panel library must first be compiled.
This is in:
	src.contrib/CERL/SGI/panel/9.6
	simply type 'make' in that directory 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
/*  You might not need to do this next part any more - Gmakefile looks
for libimage now, which seems to be on most SGIs - if it isn't on
yours, you'll have to make this lib and change the SG3d Gmakefile */

ALSO, the Image library must be compiled.
This is in: 
	src.contrib/CERL/SGI/libimage
	also type 'make' in that directory 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

When compiling under IRIX 3.x, you *must* comment out the line:
    #define FOUR_OH 
in the externs.h file.  

If compiling under IRIX 4.0 and above, the line must exist and not be
commented out.
    (this is the default)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Run gmake4.2 in this directory to build with GRASS libes.

Run <GRASS source>/src/CMD/MAKELINKS to make a link in GRASS to
the SG3d executable - or make the link manually:
ln $GISBASE/etc/front.end $GISBASE/bin/SG3d
