Each record is preceded by a four byte ascii number which defines the
length of that record.  To read a record: read that number, read that
number -4 bytes into your record buffer.   This seems like it can cause
problems with long records (e.g. many coordinates for one line segment.)

Each record contains a unique 5byte ID number

Occasionally a record is followed by a number of ^ characters which must be
skipped before attempting to read the next record.

ERROR:
Each record type is supposed to have its own record type id number; 0001
for header records, 0002 for edge records, etc.  All appear to have 0001.

Between integer values in records (except header records) is an octal 37
character which must be skipped.

Trouble with "record type".  Documentation places this as first field
in all records.  The first field is actually a 4char ascii code like
NODI, FACI, etc.   Following this are one or two numbers which are documented
as 1) rec type and 2) record id.  The numbers found in these positions do not
seem to be consistent.
EDGI   892 448 more------>
NODI   293 1054 more----->
FACI   764 216 more------>
FCIN   505 1 more-------->
1111222223 4..    1- Undocumented ascii code
				  2- Undocumented (record length?)
				  3- record type (supposed to be I2)
				  4- record ID

There is a maximum record length of 99999 bytes.  

There seems to be a maximum coordinate count of 110 for edges.  Edges longer
are forcibly broken with nodes.
