Makefile  -  Run make to create the programs listed below

read      -  Reads raw TTD .DAI files and writes out records.  Sample run:
             read < ../raw.tape.data/URBAN.DAI | more

make_digit-  Reads raw TTD .DAI files and creates GRASS digit
             results. 
             * The coordinates are UTM, but are slightly shifted
                probably due to a mix of speroids or datums
             * The digit required topology is not guaranteed to be there.
             * Only line features are preserved
             * No attribute information is preserved

             Sample run:
             make_digit < ../raw.tape.data/URBAN.DAI > URBAN.digit

             If you do not have ../raw.tape.data directory:
                This directory held raw TTD files as extracted from 
                the TTD distribution tape.  You will probably run a
                dd(1) command to read the tape directly (once positioned on
                the correct file) into make_digit.
