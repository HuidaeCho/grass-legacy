NAME
     v.import  -	Converts ascii DLG files, ascii SCS-GEF
     files, ascii ARC Ungenerate files, binary DLG files, and 
     ascii vector files into binary vector files, and creates 
     the needed support files.
     (Map Development Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     v.import

DESCRIPTION
     This program performs all of the processes	that are needed
     to	convert	ascii DLG files, binary	DLG files, ascii SCS-GEF
     files, ascii ARC Ungenerate files, and ascii vector files 
     into binary vector files. It also creates support files, 
     the dig_plus file and the dig_att file (only created when 
     importing DLG, GEF, or ARC files). The dig_plus file contains 
     topological information obtained by analyzing the vector 
     file.  The dig_att file contains attribute information 
     'stripped' from the DLG file or GEF text data. This dig_att
     file is created for vector files by the labeling function of
     the GRASS digit program.  All of the above files must be run
     through v.import before they can be used in the digit
     program of GRASS 4.0.


IMPORT FILES
     After entering the	command	v.import, the user will be
     asked which type of file to import	and create support files
     for:

     Import to GRASS Vector Format and Creates Needed Support Files

	   1  -	  Ascii	DLG file  to GRASS Vector Format
	   2  -	  Binary DLG file to GRASS Vector Format
	   3  -	  Ascii	DIGIT file  to GRASS Vector Format
	   4  -	  Binary DIGIT file to GRASS Vector Format
	   5  -	  Ascii SCS-GEF file to GRASS Vector Format
	   6  -	  Ascii ARC/INFO file to GRASS Vector Format
	   7  -	  Ascii DXF file to GRASS Vector Format

     If	numbers	1-3 or 5-6 are chosen, v.import will respond 
     with the current database units(in feet or meters), and ask if
     the new vector file is in the correct units for the database
     location.	If the new vector file is not in the correct
     units, v.import will not allow it to be placed in the
     current database location.	For each database location, all
     data layers should	have the same units. If, for some reason,
     a data layer has different	units than the rest of the data
     layers in the same	database, a new	database location will
     have to be	created	for it.

Ascii DLG File to GRASS	Vector
     Converts ascii DLG	files (such as those created in	GRASS
     2.0) to a vector file and creates the dig_plus and	dig_att
     support files. The	user is	asked several questions:
	  1. The name of the DLG data file. It should be available 
	     in the $LOCATION/dlg directory. If the DLG data has 
	     an attribute flat file, it should also be in 
	     $LOCATION/dlg.

	  2. Determine if this map is composed of Area or Line 
	     information. 
	     Do you want to give precedence to Areas 
				    (opposed to Lines)? (y/n) [y]

	  NOTE:	Some machine-processed DLG files do not	make the
	  distinction between lines and	area edges. For	example,
	  in a roads map, where	the the	desired	information is
	  line data, a downtown	block surrounded by roads may be
	  processed as an area.	 Because of this, the user is
	  asked	to choose whether to give precedence to	areas or
	  lines.  If precedence	is given to lines, the user
	  should be aware that any lines that bound unlabeled
	  areas	in the DLG file	will be	stored as line data. Any
	  unlabeled areas would	therefore be lost (this	is only	a
	  concern when areas are unlabeled, labeled area
	  information will be retained). If precedence is given
	  to areas, lines will be stored as boundaries to areas
	  that are unlabeled.

	  3. During the	building of the	Vector format:
	     Do	you want to snap nodes to other	nodes within a 
	     threshold (y/n) [n]

	  NOTE:	BE CAREFUL! This threshold is calculated using
	  the scale of the original DLG	or DIGIT file. If the
	  threshold is too high, excessive snapping may	occur,
	  destroying the file.	In general, users seldom need to
	  snap nodes. If snapping of nodes is desired, the user
	  may want to run support.vect separately. support.vect
	  allows the user to set the threshold.

	  4. Does the DLG data contain GRASS category codes. 
	     Most non-GRASS computer systems will not be able to 
	     provide the necessary codes. The flat attribute 
	     file serves this purpose. If the answer to this 
	     question is NO:

             4a. Enter a SUBJECT MATTER file name. 
		A subject file will be used to assign GRASS 
		category codes to the SCS-GEF data. It is 


GRASS 4.0		 U.S.D.A. SCS				2






v.import(1)          GRASS Reference Manual	      v.import(1)



		structured the same as a dig_cats category file. 
		It is suggested that a SUBJ directory be created 
		in the GRASS location and a file containing all 
		DLG attribute text labels by category be created.
		This will be required to provide consistancy across
		several mapsets (quads) within one location. The 
		user may use the vi text editor or the SCS macro 
		"make_subject" to create it.
             4b. Enter a ATTRIBUTE file name. 
		This is the name of the flat file which will 
		accompany a DLG from a non-GRASS system. This file 
		contains all of the DLG area numbers with a 
		corresponding text label.

             4c. Is the DLG data from an ARC/INFO system.
		ARC/INFO DLG data is handled in a slightly different
		manner.

     This process is done in three phases:
     1.	If the DLG does NOT contain category codes, then a category
	file from the attribute file is created.  Then the ascii dlg
	file is converted to a binary dlg file.
		          - OR -
       	If the DLG does contain category codes, then the ascii dlg 
	file is converted to a binary dlg file.
     2.	The binary dlg file is converted to a binary vector file,
     and the dig_att support file containing attribute
     information is created.
     3.	The dig_plus support file is created by	analyzing the
     vector file for topological information.


Binary DLG File	to GRASS Vector
     Converts binary DLG files (which should be in the bdlg
     directory) to a vector file and creates the dig_plus and	
     dig_att support files. The	user is	asked whether precedence
     should be	given to Areas or Lines	and if nodes should be 
     snapped to other nodes within a calculated threshold.

     This process is done in two phases:
     1.	The binary dlg file is converted to a binary vector file,
     and the dig_att support file containing attribute
     information is created.
     2.	The dig_plus support file is created by	analyzing the
     vector file for topological information.

Ascii Vector File into GRASS Vector
     Converts ascii DIGIT files	(which are located in dig_ascii
     directory) into binary vector files and creates the dig_plus
     support file. Since a vector file keeps the distinction
     between lines and area edges, the user is not asked to give
     precedence	to either. However, the	user will be asked if the
     user wants	to snap	from nodes to other nodes within a
     calculated	threshold.

     This process is done in two phases:
     1.	The ascii vector file is converted to a	binary vector
     file, and the dig_plus support file is created.
     2.	The dig_plus support file is created by	analyzing the
     vector file for topological information.

Binary Vector File to GRASS Vector
     Creates the dig_plus support file.

     This process is done in one phase:
     1.	The dig_plus support file is created by	analyzing the
     vector file for topological information.

Acsii SCS-GEF File to GRASS Vector
     Creates the dig_plus, dig_att, and dig_cat support files.
     Creates a registration coordinates file.

     Allows a user to create a GRASS vector (digit) file from a SCS-GEF 
     format ascii file.
     1.  The program will first request the name of the SCS-GEF file
         to be read in, it expects to find the data in the 
	 $LOCATION/gef directory. 
     2.  The program will then request the name of a GRASS vector (digit)
         file.
     3.  The program will then request the name of a SUBJECT file. A
         subject file will be used to assign GRASS category codes
         to the SCS-GEF data. It is structured the same as a dig_cats
         category file. It is suggested that a SUBJ directory be
         created in the GRASS location and a file containing all
         SCS-GEF text labels by category be created. This will be
         required to provide consistancy across several mapsets (quads)
         within one location. The user may use the vi text editor or
         the SCS macro "make_subject" to create it.











GRASS 4.0		 U.S.D.A. SCS				4






v.import(1)          GRASS Reference Manual	      v.import(1)



     4.  The program will then read the SCSGEF header information,
         interactively present information that was available, and
         request additional data of the user. 
         These questions are :


                Name of their organization. (from SCS-GEF)
                Digitized Date.             (from SCS-GEF)
                Map Name.                   (from SCS-GEF)
                Map Location.               (from SCS-GEF)
                Other Information.          (from SCS-GEF)
                State FIPS code.
                County FIPS code.
                Present GEF Coord. System (table, stplane, ll, utm).
                Coord. System Desired (utm, stplane, ll, albers).

      The program will then actively read the SCS-GEF data file and
      process it, 

      Note:
       grass4/local/bin contains SCS macro make_1_gef. This macro 
       makes one file out of the three(3) files found in SCS-GEF
       ( see SCS-GEF technical specifications for more information). 
       The macro must be run on each data set BEFORE v.import.

Ascii ARC/INFO Ungenerate Format Files to GRASS Vector
     Creates the dig_plus, dig_att, and dig_cat support files.

       Program will prompt you to enter the names of ARC/INFO files 
       to be imported to GRASS.  ARC/INFO vector files to be imported 
       into GRASS must be exported from ARC/INFO using the ARC/INFO
       Ungenerate command.   

       ARC/INFO vector files which are to are to be imported to GRASS,
       must be either line or polygon coverages. They must also be
       placed in a $LOCATION/arc directory. The section of the 
       ARC/INFO manual that cover the Ungenerate command describes 
       how to export line and polygon coverages.  

       A polygon coverage is represented by three files:
	   1) a lines file, which contains coordiates of all the area
	      edge lines;
	   2) label-point file, which contains coordintes of 
	      label-points each with a unique label-point ID number.  
	      There is one label-point for each polygon defined in 
	      the lines file; and
	   3) a label-text file, which associates label-point ID 
	      number with a category number and attribute text.
 



GRASS 4.0		 U.S.D.A. SCS				5






v.import(1)          GRASS Reference Manual	      v.import(1)



       A line coverage is represented by two files: 
	   1) a lines file, which contains coordiates of of the 
	      lines, each with a line-ID number; and
           2) a label-text file, which associates each line-ID 
	      number with a category number and attribute text.

       The program will start out by asking you which type of
       coverage is to be imported, as follows:
 

       IMPORTING A POLYGON COVERAGE

       The prompts that will be presented for coverage type 
       "polygon."

             COVERAGE TYPE
             Enter "polygon" or "line"
             Hit RETURN to cancel request
             >

        Answer "polygon"

             NEATLINE
             Do you want a neatline ?
             Enter "yes" or "no"
             > 

        If you answer yes then vectors representing a box around 
	the data will be inserted into the resulting GRASS vector 
	file, otherwise no neatline will be created.

        Next the program will prompt for the name of the 
	lines-file containing the arc coodinates of the polygons.
	The lines-file is created with the Ungenerate LINES option 
	and is the same format as the map_name.pol file created by
	the program.  The following is the prompt: 

              LINES FILENAME
             Enter name of the file created with the LINES 
             option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.
             Hit RETURN to cancel request
             >










GRASS 4.0		 U.S.D.A. SCS				6






v.import(1)          GRASS Reference Manual	      v.import(1)



        The next prompt for coverage type "polygon" asks for the
        name of the label-points file.  The label-points files is 
	created with the Ungenerate POINTS option and is the same 
	format as the mapname.lab file created by the export.vect
	ARC program. 
	The following is the prompt:

             LABEL-POINTS FILENAME
            Enter name of file created with the POINTS 
            option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command. 
            Hit RETURN if there is no such file 
            >

        The last prompt for coverage type "polygon" asks for the 
	name of the label-text file.  This file associates each 
	label-point ID number with a text string and is the same 
	format as the mapname.txt file created by the export.vect
	ARC program.
	The following is the prompt: 

             LABEL-TEXT FILENAME
            Enter the name of a file that associates
            label-point ID numbers with text label strings
            Hit RETURN if there is no such file
            > 

         The program will then scan the label-text file to 
	 determine how many columns are in the file and to 
	 determine which column should be used as the label-point 
	 ID number column.  


         The program will then tell you how many lines and columns
	 are in the label-text file.  Next you will be prompted to
	 enter the number of the column to be used for GRASS 
	 category values.  The category number column MUST contain 
	 only integers.

              Enter the number of the column that is to be used
              for GRASS category values:

         and the number the column to be used for GRASS attribute 
	 text. The attribute text column can contain a floating 
	 point number, an integer, or a word.

              Enter the number of the column that should be used 
              for GRASS attribute text: 

         Once you enter the category and attribute column numbers, 
         the program will begin conversion of the ARC/INFO 
	 Ungenerate files into GRASS vector format.

         IMPORTING A LINE COVERAGE

	 First, you are prompted for the name of the lines-file 
	 containing the arc coordinates of the lines.  The 
	 lines-file is created with the Ungenerate LINES option 
	 and is the same format as the mapname.lin file created
	 by the export.vect ARC program. 

               LINES FILENAME
              Enter name of the file created with the lines
              option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.
              Hit RETURN to cancel request
              >

         The last prompt for coverage type "line" asks for the 
	 name of the label-text file.  This file associates each 
	 line-ID number with a text string and is the same format 
	 as the mapname.txt file created by the export.vect ARC 
	 program.

               LABEL-TEXT FILENAMES
              Enter name of file associating line ID numbers 
              numbers with label text. 
              Hit RETURN if there is no such file 
              >

         The program will scan the label-text file to determine 
	 how many columns are in the file and will then tell yo
	 u how many columns are in the label-text.  Next you will
	 be prompted to enter the number of the column to be used 
         for line-ID numbers. 

              Enter the number of the column that is to be used
              for line-ID numbers:

         Next you will be prompted to enter the number of the 
	 column to be used for GRASS category values.  The category
	 number column MUST contain only integers.

              Enter the number of the column that is to be used
              for GRASS category values:

         and the number of the column to be used for GRASS attribute 
	 text.  The attribute text column can contain a floating 
	 point number, an integer, or a word.

              Enter the number of the column that should be used as
              for GRASS attribute text:

         Once you enter the column numbers the program will begin
	 conversion of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate files into GRASS 
	 vector format.

DATA FILE FORMATS
	Following are examples of the data files discussed in the 
	section above.

	LINES FILE, also known as xxx.lin or xxx.pol file.  
	This type of file can be created in ARC/INFO by using the 
	lines subcommand of the Ungenerate command.   Each line, 
	or arc, is defined by a line-ID number, followed by a list 
	of at least two easting and northing coordinate pairs,
	followed by a line with the word "END".  The file is 
	terminated with the word "END".

	The line-ID number is only important for line coverages.
	For a line coverage, the line-ID number is the number that 
	associates each line with its attribute data.

NOTES
	When importing a polygon coverage, the program finds the
	label-point ID in a label-text file by looking for the 
	second column in the file that contains a "1" on line 1,
	and a "2" on line 2.

	If you are missing a label-points or a label-text file you 
	can still import ARC/INFO data (but none of your lines or 
	areas will be labelled).
