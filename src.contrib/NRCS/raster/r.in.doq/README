The code in the directories cmd and SH make up a first cut at reading
a Digital Orthophoto Quad distributed by USGS in the standard (ST1-15-2)
format.

The directory cmd contains the GRASS code for a command line program
that reads a DOQ file on disk and writes a GRASS raster file.

The directory SH has two machine dependent shell scripts that make
it easier for the user to read DOQ file(s) from tape on a SUN4.
These scripts may need to be modified for specific instalations.


NOTE!!!!!!!!!!!

The current version of the program fixes the pixel resolution of the
DOQ at 1 meter. Early release of DOQ by USGS have the wrong resolution
in the header. When USGS has fixed this problem the program can be
changed.
