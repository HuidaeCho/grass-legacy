.TH Mlulc.read 2M
.SH NAME
Mlulc.read - Extracts Landuse/Landcover data in the ASCII 
Composite Theme Grid (CTG) data format distributed by the 
USGS in to a working file for Mlulc.USGS
.br
(Map Development Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
dd [if=tapedev] ibs=input block size cbs=80 conv=unblock | Mlulc.read arg1 
.SH DESCRIPTION
Mlulc.read extracts USGS Land Use/Land Cover data distributed in
the ASCII CTG format. Extracted data is placed into a file specified
by arg1.  Mlulc.read should be used prior to using the GRASS tool
program Mlulc.USGS.  

The program reads the data from standard input allowing the user
to pipe in the data from a file.  

The data can also be read directly from the 1/2 inch magnetic tape
distributed by USGS by using the UNIX command dd.
      
.IP if 
the pathname of the input tape drive (usually /dev/rmt0)
.IP ibs 
the physical blocking value of the data on tape,
usually written on the tape spool.  If this value is
unknown, run examine.tape prior to Mlulc.read.
.IP cbs 
this is the conversion blocking factor for ASCII CTG 
file and is by default 80
.IP conv 
set conv to unblock when extracting ASCII CTG data 
.IP arg1
output file where the data will be stored in binary format.
.SH EXAMPLES
READING FROM A FILE:

.RS
Mlulc.read outfile < infile

This will read the data from infile and place the results into
outfile.  Note that infile must be extracted from the USGS CTG
1/2 magnetic tape using the dd command:

.nf
dd if=/dev/rmt0 of=infile ibs=32000 cbs=80 conv=unblock
.fi

.RE
READING DIRECTLY FROM 1/2 INCH MAGNETIC TAPE:
.RS

.nf
dd if=/dev/rmt0 ibs=32000 cbs=80 conv=unblock | Mlulc.read outfile
.fi

This will extract data with a blocksize of 32000 from /dev/rmt0 
32000 and put the results in the file outfile.
