"README" file for programs for the Masscomp GA1000 graphics display.


These are instructions on installing the following files:
Demo		grass.colors	screen2cell.c
file2screen.c	screen2file.c

These "C" programs and "script" are used with the Masscomp GA1000 and ONLY
with the GA1000.

Description of files:
screen2file  - copies the screen image to a file.
file2screen  - places the image stored in a file on the screen.
screen2cell  - captures the image on screen and converts it to a GRASS format.
             - will produce a GRASS cell file along with the supporting
             - directories and files.
Demo         - executes "file2screen" repetitively to run "demos".
grass.colors - is the default GRASS color table stored as GA1000 register
             - values.

I have "tarred" the files out to a floppy.  Here are the steps to install
them on your Masscomp:

su root
cd /usr/scripts
tar xvf /dev/rflp

     You may want to edit the file "screen2cell.c" before compiling it.
You may want to put your own directory names in for the two variables
"DEFAULT_GISDB" and "DEFAULT_LOC" in file "screen2cell.c".  These two
variables correspond to the GRASS variables "DATABASE" and "LOCATION".
Whatever directory names you choose as your default, make sure you
enclose the names in double quotes like the present default names are.
Refer to the beginning of file "screen2cell.c" which contains documentation.
Make sure that you place the data file "grass.colors" in the directory 
"/usr/scripts".

     Make sure that you have the directory "/usr/scripts" included when initial-
izing your "path" variable in the file ".cshrc".  This file ".cshrc" will be
located in your home directory.  For my ".cshrc" file I have initialized
the variable "path" with the following one line:
set path=( . /usr/scripts /usr/local /usr/local/bin /bin /usr/bin 
           /user/grass3.1/local/bin /data/elas/bin /etc )

NOTE:  Before compiling all the "C" programs please read the documentation
which is at the beginning of files "screen2cell.c", "screen2file.c",
"file2screen.c", and "Demo".
     To compile the programs issue the following commands while being
"root" and being located at directory "/usr/scripts":

universe att
/bin/cc screen2file.c -lgp -o screen2file
/bin/cc file2screen.c -lgp -o file2screen
/bin/cc screen2cell.c -lgp -o screen2cell

     Also, for the script file "Demo" you will have to modify the value
for the variable "DEMO_DIR".  Place the directory name there where you
wish all your system's demo directories and files to reside.  Make sure
that the the permissions are 777 for this chosen directory on your system, 
so that anyone can create files under that particular directory.

Now switch from being "root" user to the "user name" that you are on your
system.
Next enter the command:  
                         Demo
This will create a directory that is your "user name" on your system under
the directory named in the variable "DEMO_DIR".  This command will also supply
you with the usage, the directories available, as well as instructions as
to how and where to make your "demo" files.  Do a "cd" and go to that
directory and then issue the command "screen2file" as instructed to save the
present image you have on your graphics screen.  The script "Demo" will
"throw" those images on your graphics screen for you.  The images will be
displayed alphabetically or you can create a file named "list" in that
directory with the names of the "demo" files you want displayed. 

     If you want the usage for any of the commands simply type the 
command itself, such as:
			screen2file
			file2screen
			screen2cell
			or 
			Demo
