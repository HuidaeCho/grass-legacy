It is strongly suggested that your system administrator for your system
install the "d.distance" program.  Modifying the "PRT_COMMAND" in file
"distance.h" requires knowing the correct "print" command for your system,
ie. lp, lpr, rsh nps lp, lp -oh, etc.

Please execute the script "PRE-Gmake" in directory "distance" before      
executing "Gmake".  Only run "PRE-Gmake" when you are the user "grass".
And you only need to run "PRE-Gmake" once.  "PRE-Gmake" essentially makes
sure you use the proper "distance.h" file for compiling by copying the
correct "distance.h" file to directory "distance".

The default "print" command for the "d.distance" program is "lp".  If your
system uses a different command for printing or you want to modify the 
"print" command used for printing out the results for the program "d.distance"
then edit the file "distance.h" in directory "distance".  Read the 
instructions concerning "PRT_COMMAND" in file "distance.h".  Comment or 
uncomment the appropriate "PRT_COMMAND" command for your system in this file
"distance.h" in directory "distance".
If the "print" command "lp" is what you want for your system then do NOT
edit file "d.distance.h" since "lp" is the default for the variable
"PRT_COMMAND".

If your system has both "/usr/bin" and "/usr/5bin" in the enviromental variable
"PATH", then be sure that "/usr/bin" is before "/usr/5bin" in the variable
"PATH".  You can ensure this by entering the command:

setenv PATH /usr/bin:$PATH

prior to executing "Gmake".
