These are the paint driver routines for the Calcomp 5800
series electrostatic color plotter. The actual interface
to the plotter is handled by the Calcomp Universal Host
Computer Basic Software (UHCBS) library, which is written
in FORTRAN.
 
The programmer will notice that calls to the FORTRAN
routines are suffixed with an underscore and all 
parameters are passed by address (e.g. plot_(&x, &y, &one)).
The UHCBS library is dependent on FORTRAN I/O, thus the
driver software doesn't use the normal GRASS/Unix I/O.
The programmer must set the device in the FORTRAN open
statement in the file plotfile.f .

The Gmakefile has a reference to "-lcal". This is the
Calcomp UHCBS library, which on our system is 
/usr/local/lib/libcal.a . You should set it to whatever
it should be on your system.
