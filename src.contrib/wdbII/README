This program was used to convert the CIA created WDB-II (World Data Base II)
data into GRASS digit format.  

After compiling, run with the following command:
    wdbII2digit MAP_NAME < input

MAP_NAME is any string (without blank spaces) which identifies the input
data.   The "input" is often a tape drive; e.g. rmt0.
