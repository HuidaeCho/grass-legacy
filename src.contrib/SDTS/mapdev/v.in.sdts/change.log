12/12/94 - mk_area_pnt.c: comp_pnts function modified, so that parameters are
			   void * instead of struct pnts *.  otherwise a warning is  
			   generated on certain platforms. also, a declaration of 
			   comp_pnts() is added to setup_areapoint ()'s variable list.

12/12/94 - dictionary.c: index() calls changed to G_index()
1/16/95 - manifolds.c: check_partition() - 
		   (1) removed check on multiple
		   themes. this was erroneous since multiple themes are not
		   diagnostic for multiple themes, only maps and domains are.
		   (2) fixed bubble-sort typo bug: replaced [i] with [j]

1/20/95 - manifolds.c: get_manifolds() -
		    added two routines (complete_global_manifold 
			and _complete_global_manifold) to get_manifolds().
			
			in the event that needed global manifolds are ommitted from
			the CATS file (as in NOAA data), these can be picked up
			with these routines.  they add global manifolds (IDEN,
			IREF, XREF, DDDS) to global_mfold if they aren't already
			there.

1/20/95 - wr_attrs.c: write_database_attributes
			fixed bug in two places: dbpath was being prepended with a
			"/".  this is an error and was deleted.

1/24/95 - manifold.c: modified complete_global_manifold,
		   _complete_global_manifold, and find_module to handle requested
		   modules that are or are not required.

1/24/95 - various files: added G_squeeze and G_strip calls (indiscriminately)
           on input strings to avoid problems with incoming data with 
		   leading or trailing white space. these calls now are employed
		   in all cases (if i found them all) EXCEPT in cases of binary
		   data (coords, binary attributes)

1/27/95 - attributes.c: removed include dig_atts.h lines
        - Gmakefile - added .h dependencies for .o targets
		- v.in.sdts.c: added (int) cast to strlen
        - fm_struct.c: changed all bzero calls to G_zero
        - att_ff_info.c: changed all bzero calls to G_zero
