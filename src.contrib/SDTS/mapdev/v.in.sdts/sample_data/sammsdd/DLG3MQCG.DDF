This master data dictionary is used to transfer DLG-3 files which use the attribute coding scheme of the Standards for Digital Line Graphs, Part 3.  This data dictionary is current as of the 4/93 change to the Standards for Digital Line Graphs, Part 3.  This data dictionary includes some entities and attributes which are not currently collected in DLG-3 files but were in the past and thus may occur in older DLG-3's.  This data dictionary includes some entities and attributes which are not in the Standards for Digital Line Graphs but are used by the USGS to support 1:2,000,000-scale DLG's and some 1:100,000-scale DLG's for federally-administered lands.
