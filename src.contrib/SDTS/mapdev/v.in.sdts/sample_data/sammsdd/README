This transfer is a Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) master data 
dictionary transfer for U.S. Geological Survey Digital Line Graph 3 (DLG-3) 
data.  It meets the requirements for separate data dictionary transfers in 
Annex A of the SDTS Topological Vector Profile.

NOTE:  The sample SDTS transfer in directory wmhy does not use this data
dictionary, since it is an older sample transfer.
