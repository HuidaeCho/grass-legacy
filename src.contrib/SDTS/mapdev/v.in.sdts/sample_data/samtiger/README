README file:

This directory contains a Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS), 
Topological Vector Profile (TVP) compliant transfer.  It was produced 
by the Geography Division of the U.S. Census Bureau, and is based 
on the TIGER/SDTS prototype product.

Standard Authority:  FIPS 173:  The Spatial Data Transfer Standard 
                       Part 4:  Topological Vector Profile, 7/6/93

Catalog Directory file name:
        xxxxCATD.DDF
        This file is the catalog directory file and it carries a 
        listing of every file to be included in the transfer including 
        file and module names.

Identification file name:
        xxxxIDEN.DDF
        This file contains information that describes the overall
        characteristics of the data in this transfer, including
        it geographical domain.

ISO 8211 conformance:
        All files with extension *.DDF are in the ISO 8211 file transfer
        format.  All SDTS spatial addresses are expressed in two 32 bit 
        binary sub-fields defined by the ISO8211.  Leader and directory
        information is dropped whenever possible.  Files are Level 2 of
        ISO 8211.

Purpose of Data Set:  Prototype of the TIGER in SDTS/TVP.

TIGER/SDTS prototype dataset caveat considerations:
     
     (1)  The TIGER/SDTS prototype dataset includes the full 
          suite of the TIGER model components and constructs 
          (as described in TIGER Documentation published in 1989).
          This prototype is a copy of the Census Bureau's 
          internal TIGER data base and as a result contains
          many data items which are not present in TIGER/Line.  

     (2)  The TIGER/SDTS prototype datasets were produced to 
          test the elements and functionality of the prototype 
          production system and SDTS standard itself.

     (3)  The Census Bureau has elected to distribute the TIGER/SDTS 
          prototype datasets in order to receive user feedback 
          on the data model concepts and data content.
