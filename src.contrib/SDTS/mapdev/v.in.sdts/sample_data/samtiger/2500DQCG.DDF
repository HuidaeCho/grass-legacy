For these two sources, data for a given category will contain attribute codes that reflect the information portrayed on the source. The digital line data for a given category of data contain at least the same level of content and detail as shown on the source.00695 D     00049   4404000100070000DQCG06390007     2DQCG     2Other attribute information in TIGER/SDTS  was gathered from many sources.  The Census Bureau's staff associated the attribute information with the spatial information.  Most procedures for gathering the needed attributes are clerical. The quality of these attributes was ensured by various test conducted before, during, and after the time attribute information was entered into the file. Tests included source material selection and evaluation checks, quality control checks on staff work, independent reviews by local and tribal leaders of maps produced from the data base, and staff reviews of computer-performed operations.00449 D     00049   4404000100070000DQCG03930007     3DQCG     3Standard geocodes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, and places are used when encoding spatial entities.  TIGER/SDTS  also uses the Census Bureau's Geographic Identification Code Scheme.  Information used to create the file is as complete as possible.  Spatial data tests for logical consistency have been done when the original files for TIGER were compiled.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
