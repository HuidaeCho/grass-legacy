DLG coverage is extensive and comprises most of the rural and suburban area of the TIGER file. Coordinates for the file are carried out to one millionth of a degree.  The source dates and reliability vary widely.  Throughout the past seven years and in preparation for the 1990 Decennial Census, the TIGER file was being updated and maintained by various internal and external procedures.  Sources for these updates can be divided into five general areas:00245 D     00049   4404000100070000DQHL01890007     2DQHL     2Original source includes manipulation and integration of GBF/DIME with DLG files, additions, deletions to the Master Reference File, plus other sources used to build TIGER files.00204 D     00049   4404000100070000DQHL01480007     3DQHL     3Computer update source refers to the Census Bureau's Geography Division computeroperations for the improvement and update of TIGER files.00212 D     00049   4404000100070000DQHL01560007     4DQHL     4The office procedures source refers to additions, deletions, or modifications based on procedures from technical documents and office operations.00302 D     00049   4404000100070000DQHL02460007     5DQHL     5Enumerator sources are updates checked by field operations.  Features are updated by correcting field map sheets with pencil.  Geodetic control for this source is nonexistent.  The new or corrected features are added to the TIGER file.00628 D     00049   4404000100070000DQHL05720007     6DQHL     6The local official source represents update operations reviewed by a local government official.  Maps are sent to the highest elected official of a governmental unit for use in various census programs and some maps are returned with update annotations.  The update is added in TIGER without question once theelected official has approved the correction to a boundary, street, feature, andso forth.  Ordinance numbers are supplied by the governmental unit if changes toa boundary have occurred.  Changes made through local officials do not have geodetic control.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
