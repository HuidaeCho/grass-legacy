SDTS Import name proposal:

The following scheme allows transfer between DOS and UNIX, and accomodates
multiple manifold (layer) transfers.  

Example:  SDTS dataset has filenames of the form PRNMxxxx.DDF
          There are 7 different layers or manifolds, all for the
          same partition.

Assume thee data is being imported using the root name "junk"


1. grass vector map names:

11 character limit plus 1-3 character extension. use the extension to distinguish
layers:

e.g.  junkette_1, junkette_2, junkette_23  (or wmhy_del.434)

2. database names (these will be "rdbms-ready" ascii files for SDTS attributes
and the GRASS-RDBMS "link" files):

a. for regular attribute tables:

    4-character SDTS prefix +  4-char module name + .db extension:

         e.g. PRNMAP01.db

              HY01B011.db

b. GRASS/database link tables:

  (1) single maps   grass layer_name + .db
  (1) multiple maps  first letter of grass layer-name 
                     [ + number of layer ] 
                     + sdts-prefix + .db

    e.g.  if layer name is "junkette" and there are 7 surfaces:
    
        j_1PRNM.db
        j_2PRNM.db
        j_3PRNM.db
        j_4PRNM.db
        j_5PRNM.db
        j_6PRNM.db
        j_7PRNM.db


c. composite link tables

	  PRNMffel.db
	  PRNMffat.db
	  PRNMobat.db

Special cases:

1. Simple GRASS-type import, i.e., where there is only a single composite
link-attribute database file. (this will apply to all datasets with
1-to-1 obj-attr relations and a single attribute file)

   use user-specified output name for both grass map and attribute
   file, as follows:

	  grass map:         junkette
	  rdbms-ready file:  junkette.db

2. If either the SDTS prefix, or the output maplayer name chosen by the
user lacks a leading alpha character (e.g., as in TIGER/SDTS's 2500 prefix),
the letter 'T' is arbitrarily prepended to the db-ready filenames in the
db create and load scripts.  Informix and other SQL rdbms's need tables 
and databases to begin with a letter.

	 so, the db table for "2500AP57.db" will be "T2500AP57".
