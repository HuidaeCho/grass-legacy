supplementary metadata and data quality reports for a vector map, preparatory 
to their incorporation in an SDTS transfer dataset.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBv.sdts.meta\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
This menu-driven Tcl/Tk program enables the user to prepare and install supplementary
metadata and data quality reports for a vector map preceding the creation of
an SDTS transfer dataset.  With v\fI.sdts.meta\fR, metadata and data quality 
files 
can be edited, saved, retrieved, and modified, and then installed in the 
GRASS database in association with a particular vector map layer.  
Subsequently, \fIv.out.sdts\fR will incorporate this metadata along with the 
associated vector map in an SDTS transfer dataset.
.LP
In addition to the five data quality modules, supplementary metadata items 
currently able to be edited and installed include (1) creation 
date for the original source map; (2) a general title for the transfer; 
(3) a general comment about the transfer; (4) name of geographic 
datum; (4) and (5), name and definition for the kind of entity contained in 
the GRASS vector layer being transferred; (6) and (7) custom definitions for
the \fIdig_att\fR and \fIdig_cats\fR values being transferred.
