                        Closed Discrepancy Reports / Statements of Need


      This is a summary of all discrepancy reports and statements 
      of need (enhancement requests) for the FIPS 123 Function Library  
      which have been closed (either via fixes to the software or determination
      that there is not a problem.)
      

      92DR002 05/01/92 1.0          Verify tag 0..1

      No DDR functions verify that tag 0..1 exists in   
      the directory and in the data descriptive area    
      within the DDR.  Also, no DR functions verify that
      tag 0..1 exists as a field in each DR.            

      Modify the logic in the appropriate functions to  
      ensure ISO 8211 conformance.                      

      92DR003 05/01/92 1.0          Field tag order

      According to ISO 8211, field tags within the DR   
      directory must follow the order of the field tags 
      within the DDR directory.  Field tags may be      
      omitted but not reordered.                        

      For the read-side, field tags can be examined when
      loading the DR.  For the write-side, the field    
      tags can be examined when writing them to the     
      structures and when computing the directory before
      unloading.  Logic within the wr123sfld() function 
      would allow the tags to be examined when a field  
      or subfield is written prior to completing the DR 
      processing with end123rec().                      

      Add logic to the appropriate functions to ensure  
      ISO 8211 conformance.  Implement DR.              

      92DR005 06/26/92 0.8          Binary data

      The logic in function get123dval which retrieves  
      both fixed and variable length bit-field data is  
      incorrect.  It appears ISO 8211's bit-field       
      implementations were interpreted incorrectly.     

      Interpretation of bit-field data discussed in ISO 
      8211 is difficult to clearly understand.  Other   
      resources should be consulted to gain an          
      understanding about this part of the standard.    

      Consult other resources for interpretations of ISO
      8211 and bit-field data.  Implement DR.           

      92DR006 05/14/93 1.0          Tag 0..0 0..9 order

      Field tags 0..0 through 0..9 must be in ascending 
      order within the DDR directory according to ISO   
      8211.  Additionally, field tags shall occur only  
      once within the DDR.                              

      For the read side, field tags can be examined when
      loading the DR.  For the write side, the field    
      tags can be examined when writing them to the     
      structures and when computing the directory before
      uploading.  Logic within the wr123ddsfld()        
      function would allow the tags to be examined when 
      a field or subfield is written prior to completing
      DDR processing with end123ddrec().                

      Add logic to the appropriate functions to ensure  
      ISO 8211 conformance.                             
                                                        
      92DR008 05/06/92 0.7          'R' leader

      If a data record containing a leader ID of 'R' is 
      written, the leader and directory of subsequent   
      data records are appropriately omitted, but the   
      data in the user data area are terminated         
      incorrectly.                                      

      Function bak123sfld() does not locate the previous
      dr structure when a field is written for a data   
      record with leader ID of 'R'.  The data record    
      length calculation in function rd123rec() is one  
      byte too large.  The field terminator normally    
      written after the leader and directory is written 
      when there is no leader and directory.            

      92DR009 05/06/92 0.7          Blank subfield

      When writing a DR by field and setting the DDR to 
      the "A" type format control for subfield delimited
      input data, an input one character space, ASCII   
      decimal 32, will not be written to the selected   
      subfield.  The resultant output is a delimited    
      subfield that contains no character               
      representation.                                   

      Modify software so that single space fields will  
      not be truncated.  Implement DR.                  

      92DR010 05/06/92 0.7          0..2 tag

      The optional user field associated with tag 0..2  
      of the Data Descriptive Record (DDR) is not       
      handled properly when written using wr123ddfld(). 

      An incorrect subfield option is used to invoke    
      wr123ddsfld() before wr123ddfld() returns to the  
      calling program/driver.  Also, er123ddsfld() does 
      not remove the DD structure containing the actual 
      tag 0..2 associated with the optional user field  
      contents (cr_hd->u_afd).                          

      Implement appropriate changes to correctly process
      the optional user field within the DDR.           
                                                        
      92DR011 06/26/92 0.8          Nondelimited subfld

      Function wr123fld() incorrectly processes         
      nodelimited subfields within a field and stores   
      them into one data value structure.  Thus, the    
      field is treated as a subfield.                   

      Functions wr123fld() requires modification to     
      divide the field into subfields according to the  
      format controls corresponding to the associated   
      field tag.                                        

      Implement appropriate changes to correctly process
      the nondeliminated subfields.                     

      92DR012 05/14/93 1.0          Array dimension

      Function wr123fld() incorrectly processes a DR    
      field that contains the number of dimensions, the 
      dimension lengths, and data values.  A zero is    
      inserted into the field following the number of   
      dimensions subfield.                              

      The added zero was encountered within the field   
      described above which had delimeters among the    
      data values and no formats described in the       
      corresponding DDR fields.                         

      Implement appropriate changes to correctly        
      preserve the array dimension in the DR field.     

      92DR013 07/17/92 0.9          Explicit beg123rec()

      In the DG/UX environment, a segmentation fault    
      occurs when function beg123rec() is explicitly    
      invoked by an application program prior to        
      invoking wr123fld() with the start-of-record      
      option (2).  The application abnormally terminates
      following the segmentation fault.                 
                                                        
      This problem is not specific to the DG/UX         
      environment.  However, within the MS-DOS          
      environment, an error indicating a segmentation   
      fault may not appear.                             
                                                        
      Function beg123rec() is an "optional" function.   
      It does not have to be explicitly invoked.  The   
      other library functions invoke it automatically   
      when required.  Thus, an interim resolution is to 
      omit explicit function calls to beg123rec() in the
      application program.                              
                                                        

      INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS:                           
      Function wr123fld() was modified during the       
      resolution of 92DR005 to process binary data and  
      also to correctly process nondelimited blank      
      subfields (92DR011).  The additional source code  
      to wr123fld() does not examine the beginning of   
      the dr structure list to determine if the list was
      initialized.  Function wr123fld() only examines   
      the input option argument passed into it to       
      determine if the list was initialized.            
                                                        
      RECOMMENDATIONS:                                  
      In addition to examining the input option         
      argument, logic should be inserted into wr123fld()
      to examine the beginning of the dr structure list:
      the header structure, and if the header structure 
      exists, the structure which follows.  The         
      modification should include logic to consider the 
      "no leader R flag", contained within the current  
      fm structure, for data records having leader IDs  
      indicating repetition.

      92DR014 05/14/93 1.0          DOS memory mgmt

      Memory management overhead problem in MS DOS      
      environment.  Software performance is impacted    
      when working with large transfer files.           

      92DR015 05/14/93 1.0          Integers on SES

      Software gets lost when reading past 1st record   
      when recompiled on Intergraph SES workstation.    

      92DR016 05/14/93 1.0          Division in ch123siz

      The ANSI C library function ldiv() performs       
      division on a long integer using the supplied     
      arguments.  The function produces a quotient and a
      remainder, both long integers, and stores them in 
      a defined structure.                              
                                                        
      FIPS123 function ch123size() examines the         
      remainder member of the structure incorrectly in  
      one statement.  Instead of comparing the remainder
      with zero, ch123size() compares the remainder with
      NULL.  This comparison causes an implicit         
      conversion type error.                            
                                                        
      The error only appeared in the Amdahl MVS         
      environment, but the code should be corrected and 
      implemented for all platforms.  The solution is to
      change the conditional statement to check for zero
      instead of NULL.                                  
                                                        
      92DR017 05/14/93 1.0          ch123size() buffer

      If operating in the MS-DOS environment and the    
      data descriptive file (DDF) contains either a     
      large number of data records or large records,    
      function end123file() sometimes fails.  This does 
      not occur on the Data General platform.           

      INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS:                           
      Function ch123size(), which is invoked by         
      end123file(), truncates extraneous data from a    
      file that was opened in write mode.  Dynamic      
      memory allocation for a buffer of MAXSIZ bytes may
      fail causing function end123file() to return      
      failure.  This usually occurs when a great number 
      of data records are processed or the records are  
      very large.                                       
                                                        
      RECOMMENDATIONS:                                  
      Instead of function ch123size() dynamically       
      allocating a buffer, use one of the FIPS123 global
      strings, glb_str or glb_str2, already declared.   
                                                        
      Resolving this problem is necessary for CSC to    
      continue to perform regression testing for MS-DOS.
                                                        
      The solution is platform independent and does not 
      require compiler directives to be inserted into   
      the source code.                                  

      92DR018 05/14/93 1.0          Binary support tools

      The Topological Vector Profile (TVP) requires that
      spatial addresses (coordinates) be encoded as     
      32-bit binary values using "two's complement"     
      format.  Utilities need to be written to make it  
      easier to use binary data.                        
                                                        
      Two functions are to be added to the library to   
      convert between long (32-bit) signed integers and 
      the strings which are used by the library's read  
      and write functions.  Because the TVP restricts   
      binary values to long signed integers, it is not  
      necessary to handle any other type of binary      
      value.                                            
                                                        
      SDTS requires that all binary values be "big      
      endian" with the most significant bit first.  Many
      computers, including PC's, use "little endian" or 
      "middle endian" for their internal storage of     
      binary values.  These functions shall include an  
      option to change the byte order and thus convert  
      between big endian used in SDTS and either little 
      or middle endian.                                 
                                                        
      The first function shall convert an input long    
      signed integer into a string which can then be    
      input to write functions.  As an option, the      
      calling routine can specify that the byte order is
      to be changed (the calling routine is responsible 
      for knowing if it is necessary to change the byte 
      order.)  This should be specified by passing a    
      parameter which has 3 possible values:  1 - no    
      change (keep in big endian), 2 - change to little 
      endian, 3 - change to middle endian.              
                                                        
      The second function shall convert a string        
      containing four bytes, such as that returned by   
      read functions, into a long signed integer.  It   
      shall also have an option to change the byte order
      from little or middle endian to big endian.       

      92DR019   /  /                Duplicate FT's

      Some files in the prototype DLG-3 data set contain
      two field terminators at the end of records.  One 
      such file is wmhycats.ddf.  The problem appears to
      appear in files where the leaders and directories 
      have been dropped from data records.

      92SN002   /  /                Pad with ^ character

      A revision to ISO8211 has been made.  This        
      revision pads the end of transfer files with a '^'
      character to ensure the file ends at a certain    
      byte count.  For additional information consult   
      5th year revised ISO8211.                         

      Section A.1.1:  Media Record Constructs of the ISO
      8211 Revision proposed 26 June 1992, is unclear.  
      It is difficult to evaluate its impact on the FIPS
      Pub 123 software library at this time.  This      
      revision seems to state that logical records are  
      to be written, blocked, and spanned into          
      fixed-length records and that the circumflex      
      character, '^', is used to completely fill the    
      last physical block.  The recieving system must be
      able to read either a fixed or variable length    
      record.  If a system can read variable length     
      records, it can also read fixed-length records and
      un-block them.  The intention of the standard is  
      that the software recognize end-of-file when it   
      encounters the circumflex character.              
                                                        
      RECOMMENDATIONS:                                  
                                                        
      The FIPS 123 software library currently recognizes
      the circumflex character as the end-of-file.  The 
      software has been implemented only on             
      variable-length records, and it is capable of     
      reading fixed-length records as variable length.  
      If it becomes necessary for the software to write 
      fixed-length records, then the end123file() or    
      ch123size() routine will have to be modified to   
      fill the last record with the circumflex          
      character.  This change could be completed in     
      about 5 days.  As of the date of this evaluation, 
      the referenced revision to the ISO 8211 standard  
      has not been approved.

      93DR021 05/14/93 1.0          rd_ddsfld output tag

      The output argument tag of function rd123ddsfld() 
      is declared as a 10-byte character string.  This  
      function should declare tag as a character pointer
      instead of a string to avoid identifier boundary  
      problems.                                         
                                                        
      The application program has to declare and reserve
      space for this argument.  All other functions     
      which have a character string as an argument allow
      the application program to declare the size of the
      arrays.

      93DR023 05/14/93 1.0          wr123fld temp file

      Function wr123fld uses a temporary file for the   
      processing of each field.  This potentially adds  
      to I/O and degrades performance.  David Stigberg  
      at CERL has noted a significant performance       
      degradation since the use of this temporary file  
      was added.  A degradation was also noted in the   
      creation of the DLG-3 data sets.                  
                                                        
      For each field that is written by wr123fld, a new 
      temporary file is opened, the field is written to 
      the temporary file, the temporary file is rewound 
      and then read by load123fld.  The original field  
      data remains in memory.  It seems feasible that   
      the original data in memory can be used by        
      load123fld rather than temporarily writing the    
      data to a temporary file.                         
                                                        
      Originally wr123fld() and ld123rec() performed    
      duplicate processing to load a data field into    
      memory.  Subroutine wr123fld() loaded the data    
      field into the FIPS 123 memory structures which   
      were later written to the data file by            
      uld123rec().  Subroutine ld123rec() read a data   
      record, field by field, from the data file and    
      loaded it into the FIPS 123 memory structures.    
      Since these routines duplicated processing and    
      required individual maintenance, the duplicated   
      section of code was extracted from ld123rec() to  
      create subroutine load123fld().  Subroutine       
      load123fld() reads a field, from a file, and loads
      it into memory making it necessary for wr123fld() 
      to create a temporary file to be read by          
      load123fld().                                     
                                                        
      Recommend that load123fld() and all subordinate   
      routines be modified to load a data field from an 
      array of characters into memory instead of reading
      them from a file.  Subroutine ld123rec() could    
      read the field into an array of characters before 
      invoking load123fld() and subroutine wr123fld()   
      already has the field stored in an array of       
      characters.  File I/O would be eliminated in      
      wr123fld(). Subroutine load123fld() would no      
      longer rely on subordinate routines to perform    
      I/O, wr123fld() would no longer perform temporary 
      file I/O and ld123rec() would increase in         
      performance due to a type of field level I/O      
      buffering.                                        
                                                        
      93DR025 05/14/93 1.0          Binary parentheses

      When a format of ((2B(32))) is written to the DDR 
      using wr123ddfld, the outer pair of parentheses is
      removed from the format.                          
                                                        
      This format is a valid ISO 8211 format which is   
      required by the SDTS Topological Vector Profile   
      for spatial addresses which have repeating fields 
      (as found in the SDTS Line module).  ISO 8211 does
      not allow a binary field immediately after the    
      left parenthesis to implicitly repeat, therefore  
      it is necessary to add the additional pair of     
      parentheses.                                      

      93DR027 05/14/93 1.0          Vector with 1 subfld

      Library is unable to write vectors with only one  
      subfield label.                                   
      This is required for some attribute primary       
      modules in DLG-3 which have only one label.       

      Findings:                                         
                                                        
      Functions responsible for storing data values into
      the appropriate data structures do not handle a DR
      field consisting of vector data with only one     
      subfield label contained in the corresponding DDR 
      field.  These functions were developed to handle  
      vector data having multiple subfield labels.      
      During development, it was decided that vector    
      data consisting of only one subfield would better 
      be described as elementary data.  However, SDTS   
      does allow vector data to be only one subfield.   
                                                        
      Recommendations:                                  
                                                        
      Make the necessary modifications to the library in
      order to correctly handle vector data containing  
      only one subfield.                                

      93DR030 09/14/93 1.0.2        Arrays & wr123sfld()

      Function wr123sfld() does not consistently load   
      into the correct data structures DR subfields (the
      number of dimensions and the length of each       
      dimension) that describe an array.  The function  
      loads the structures correctly, however, when the 
      DR field containing the numer of dimensions and   
      dimension lengths are found in the first data     
      record.  When this DR field is found in other data
      records, wr123sfld() attempts to load the data    
      into the wrong data structures and a fault        
      segmentation occurs.                              
                                                        
      This problem does not occur when labels are       
      included in the corresponding DDR field.          
                                                        
      At this time, the problem has been traced to      
      beg123rec()/end123rec() which modifies the current
      dr structure pointer.  Additional analysis is     
      suggested.                                        
                                                        
      Before beginning a new data record, subroutine    
      beg123rec() calls uld123rec(), which calls        
      cmp123drdir() and rd123fld(), both of which change
      the cur_dd pointer.  After unloading is completed 
      the field control entry for the last field of the 
      previous record is used to write the first        
      subfield of the new record.                       
                                                        
      Modify uld123rec() to save the cur_dd and reset it
      before returning to beg123rec().                  

      93DR031 09/14/93 1.0.2        Arrays & chk123nsfld

      A segmentation fault occurs when function         
      chk123nsfld() is invoked for a DR field that      
      contains Cartesian data with no labels present in 
      the corresponding DDR field.  For example,        
      chk123nsfld() encounters problems in the following
      scenario:                                         
                                                        
      DDR field:      2600;&Field Name&&(A,I);          
      DR field:       2&2&3&alpha&1&beta&2&gamma&3;     
                                                        
      The problem actually occurs below chk123nsfld()   
      and may be related to a previous documented       
      discrepancy in function bak123sfld() (92DR007).   
                                                        
      Additional analysis is suggested.                 

      Resolving this discrepancy report may require that
      93DR030 be completed first.                       
                                                        
      The segmentation fault results when the following 
      occurs:                                           
      wr123sfld() writes the record identifier subfield 
      just prior to writing the cartesian data field.   
      After writing the record identifier the subfield  
      state is set to 4 (finished) and chk123nsfld() is 
      called.  chk123nsfld() writes a dummy subfield,   
      calls chk123sfld(), and calls bak123sfld() to     
      delete the dummy subfield.  bak123sfld()          
      decrements the subfield state to 3 (data          
      subfield).  The cartesian data field is written   
      next and because the subfield state is 3 (data    
      subfield) the number of dimensions, and dimension 
      lengths are stored as data values instead of being
      placed in the proper NUM_DIM & DM structures.     
                                                        

      One or both of the following correction should be 
      made.                                             
                                                        
      chk123nsfld() should save the SF_STATE_DR variable
      and restore it to its proper value after the call 
      to bak123sfld().                                  
                                                        
      and/or                                            
                                                        
      wr123sfld() should check the field control when   
      the write option is start of field (6) and set the
      SF_STATE_DR variable to the proper value for that 
      type of subfield.  A check similar to this exists 
      at the beginning of wr123sfld() when the          
      SF_STATE_DR variable is out of bounds.            
                                                        
      The following additional problems have been       
      identified concerning checking/backing subfields: 
                                                        
      When the number of dimensions subfield is written,
      wr123sfld() increments the subfield state from 1  
      to 2.  If bak123sfld() is called next, it will    
      attempt to delete a non-existent dimension length 
      instead of the number of dimensions subfield.     
      bak123sfld() should include logic to properly     
      delete a cartesian data field written using       
      wr123sfld().                                      
                                                        
      When calling bak123sfld() to delete dimension     
      length subfields, the DM structure pointed to by  
      the cur_dm->next pointer is deleted. Instead,     
      bak123sfld() should start at the dim_lptr pointer,
      travel down to the end of the dm list, delete the 
      last dm entry, and set the current dm to the last 
      remaining dm entry.  Because dimension length     
      subfields are not deleted properly, the number of 
      DM entries can exceed the number of dimensions    
      subfield value.  Incrementing of the SF_STATE_DR  
      variable from dimension length (2) to data value  
      subfield (3) is done by wr123sfld() when the      
      number of DM entries equal the value stored in the
      number of dimensions subfield. As a result        
      wr123sfld() never increments the SF_STATE_DR      
      variable to data value subfield (3). Because this 
      never happens, all cartesian data subfield values 
      are stored in DM entries instead of DV entries.   

      93DR032 06/08/93 1.0.1        Arrays & chk123sfld

      For Cartesian data with an array descriptor in the
      data record and no labels, chk123sfld does not    
      correctly return the description of the array data
      for all except the last element of the array.  The
      description of the array descriptor subfields is  
      returned correctly.  The description of the actual
      array elements is returned as "DIMENSION LENGTH"  
      for all except the last element.  The format of   
      the array elements is incorrectly returned as "I" 
      (the format of the array descriptor) for all      
      except the last array element.                    
                                                        
      The PRM needs to be updated.  It does not indicate
      that the descriptions "NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS" or   
      "DIMENSION LENGTH" are returned for the array     
      descriptor subfields.  It is unclear as to what,  
      if anything, is returned as a description for the 
      actual array subfields.                           

      Nothing is returned in the description and format 
      fields when calling chk123sfld() for cartesian    
      data subfields with no labels.  The               
      description/format that appear to be returned are 
      really just the values from the last "successful" 
      call to chk123sfld().                             
                                                        
      The routine chk123sfld() performs processing based
      on the previous state when the open mode is write 
      and the current state when the open mode is read, 
      in either case the variable p_state is initialized
      to out of bounds (4) at the beginning of          
      chk123sfld().  Cartesian data subfields without   
      labels are not checked because the p_state        
      variable is never set to an in bounds value in    
      chk123sfld().                                     
                                                        
      Routine chk123nsfld() also produces a segmentation
      fault with the same cartesian data field because  
      it calls rt123pvsfld() which attempts to move to  
      the last dimension length subfield without first  
      positioning a pointer at the beginning of the     
      dimension length list.                            

      Modify chk123sfld() to set the p_state variable to
      the current sf_state_dr when checking a cartesian 
      data value subfield and data values exist.        
                                                        
      Modify rt123pvsfld() to position cur_fm->cur_dm to
      cur_fm->cur_dr->dim_lptr before attemping to go to
      the last dimension length in list.                
                                                        
      Modify PRM to indicate that "NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS"
      and "DIMENSION LENGTH" are return as the          
      description from calls to chk123sfld() and that   
      the labels are returned as the description of the 
      cartesian data values, hence, no labels, no       
      description.  The same may also be needed for the 
      chk123nsfld() entry.                              
                                                        
      Modify chk123sfld() to initialize descr and frmt  
      to the null character before checking subfields.  

      93DR033 03/11/94 1.0.3        Array descriptor

      The library does not support the use of an array  
      descriptor in place of labels in an ISO 8211 DDR  
      (use of the arrray descriptor in a DR is          
      supported.)                                       

      Findings:                                         
                                                        
      The DDR-related functions must be modified to     
      determine whether a label subfield in the DDR     
      contains Cartesian labels or array descriptors and
      store the descriptors to be used later when       
      processing DRs.  Logic must be added to the source
      code to read, write, and erase these array        
      descriptors within a DDR field.  The dd structure 
      requires two additional members to store the      
      number of dimensions and a list of each dimension 
      length.                                           
                                                        
      The DR-related functions must determine whether   
      the new DDR structure pointers or the existing DR 
      structure pointers are to be used to obtain the   
      number of dimensions and each dimension length for
      the corresponding data.  At this time, it is      
      suggested that the new dimension length pointer in
      the dd structure be examined to determine if the  
&a6H
      array is described in the DDR.  If it is NULL,    
      then the array is described within the DR field.  
      Fortunately, much of the logic responsible for    
      reading, writing, and backing up among the data   
      values using the number of dimensions and each    
      dimension length specified within a DR field is   
      already contained in the library.                 
                                                        
      Upon ending a data record, the dimension length   
      list is normally removed from memory; however, the
      array descriptors contained in the DDR structures 
      field should remain unchanged until the file is   
      closed.                                           
                                                        
      Prologs to functions which access the dd          
      structures need to be  updated to show the new    
      structure members.                                
                                                        
                                                        
      Recommendations:                                  
                                                        
      The DR should be implemented.  However, the       
      library currently supports array descriptions to  
      be located within the DR fields.  This may be used
      as a work-around until this discrepancy is        
      resolved.                                         
                                                        
      93DR034 06/08/93 1.0.1        FT in binary data

      If the ISO 8211 field terminator character        
      (decimal 30) occurs in a Cartesian field with a   
      null vector, it is interpretted incorrectly as the
      end of the record by rd123sfld.                   
                                                        

      The routines load123fld() and ret123fv() are      
      called when reading data records.  Both contain   
      code that is executed when reading vectors and    
      arrays with null labels.  The end of a vector or  
      array is found when the primary dimension has been
      filled and a FT is the next input character.  This
      is a problem because binary vectors and arrays,   
      although terminated with a FT, can contain a FT as
      a valid binary value.  The end of a binary vector 
      or array must be detected by determining that the 
      complete length of the vector or array has been   
      processed, instead of looking for the terminating 
      FT.                                               

      93DR035 06/08/93 1.0.1        FT in binary data 2

      When using wr123fld to write a field which        
      contains array descriptors in the data record,    
      data which occurs after a decimal 30 (the field   
      terminator character) is not written to the output
      file even though the str_len parameter indicates  
      that there is additional data.                    
      
      Fixed with 93DR034.                               

      93DR036 09/14/93 1.0.2        Drop leader

      When writing a field which contains array         
      descriptors in the data record, wr123sfld fails   
      when using 'R' in the leader to indicate that all 
      but the first record do not have a leader and     
      directory.  wr123sfld fails when writing data in  
      the second record (the first record with a dropped
      leader and directory.)                            
                                                        
      This may be related to 93DR030.  Sample program   
      doq6.c has this problem.                          

      93DR037 09/14/93 1.0.2        Use of memset

      When writing a file using wr123sfld, 85.9% of the 
      time is spent in the memset system function.  This
      can potentially cause a major degradation of      
      performance in production systems.                
                                                        
      The use of memset in this situation and all cases 
      where it is used should be evaluated.  More       
      efficient alternatives should be investigated.    

      The FIP123 function library frequently uses the   
      memset C function to initially fill character     
      string variables with null characters.  The       
      performance degradation seen is caused by the     
      repeated initialization of character strings      
      declared to the maximum possible size (global     
      variable MAZSIX or MAXINT).  Most of these strings
      can successfully be initialized to empty by       
      setting the first character in the variable to the
      null character.  These same character string      
      variables must be terminated with a null character
      after character string data is stored in them.    
                                                        
      Note: the performance degradation noted in        
      wr123fld(), (93DR039), is also caused by same     
      inefficient character string initialization.      

      Remove all possible memset() calls.               

      93DR038 09/14/93 1.0.2        Binary value 255

      The library is unable to write an 8-bit binary    
      value of 255 (decimal) using wr123sfld.  The      
      library should be capable of reading or writing   
      any binary value.                                 

      The FIPS PUB 123 Function Library used the decimal
      value 255 to "hold" the place of null subfields.  
      Most of this functionality was removed for data   
      records when load123fld() was developed and       
      implemented into wr123fld().  The subroutine      
      stor123dv() still contains statements that convert
      a single 255 value to an null character string    
      before writing it to the file.                    
                                                        
      Remove the statements that convert a single 255   
      value to a null character string from stor_dv.c:  
                                                        
           if ((str_len == 1) && (*wr_str == SEP)) {    
              *wr_str = NC;                             
           }                                            

      93DR039 09/14/93 1.0.2        wr123fld performance

      Even with completion of 93DR023, performance of   
      wr123fld is significantly slower than before the  
      6/92 "binary fix" release.  A test program which  
      wrote 1000 records using wr123fld was             
      significantly slower using the current version of 
      the library:

      5/92              12 seconds      0.4 seconds

      When the same records were written by subfield    
      using wr123sfld, performance is dramatically      
      better:                                           
                                                        
                3.9 seconds     0.2 seconds           
                                                        
      The DLG3 to SDTS translator presently writes by   
      field using wr123fld.  It takes approximately 13  
      1/2 minutes to write a Line module.  Exact figures
      are not available, but this took only a minute or 
      two using the 5/92 version.                       

      The FIP123 function library frequently uses the   
      memset C function to initially fill character     
      string variables with null characters. The        
      performance degradation seen is caused by the     
      repeated initialization of character strings      
      declared to the maximum possible size (global     
      variable MAZSIX or MAXINT).  Most of these strings
      can successfully be initialized to empty by       
      setting the first character in the variable to the
      null character.  These samecharacter string       
      variables must be terminated with a null character
      after character string data is stored in them.    
                                                        
      Note: the performance degradation noted in        
      wr123sfld(), (93DR037),is also caused by same     
      inefficient character string initialization.      

      Remove all possible memset() calls.               

      93DR040 09/14/93 1.0.2        load123fld length

      Function load123fld() calls ret123fv() to store   
      formatted array data fields.  The field and its   
      length is passed to ret123fv() and which fails if 
      the array contains adjacent fixed-length binary   
      subfields that do not end on a byte boundary.     
                                                        

      Function load123fld() passes the array field and  
      its length to ret123fv().  The length passed is   
      cur_fm->cur_dr->fd_len which is computed to       
      account for any adjacent fixed-length binary      
      subfields (compressed subfields).  The value of   
      cur_fm->cur_dr->fd_len is correct when            
      load123fld() is called by ld123rec().  Function   
      ld123rec() passes adjacent fixed-length binary    
      subfields to load123fld() in a compressed form.   
      However, wr123fld() passes un-compressed adjacent 
      fixed-length binary subfields to load123fld(),    
      each adjacent fixed-length binary subfield begins 
      on a byte boundary and is filled to a byte        
      boundary before the next binary subfield begins.  
      The length that must be passed to load123fld() by 
      wr123fld() is greater than cur_fm->cur_dr->fd_len.
      The correct length for un-compressed adjacent     
      fixed-length binary subfields must be calculated  
      by subtracting pointers to the end and begining of
      the field.                                        

      There are two calls to ret123fv() in load123fld().
      One for formatted array fields with labels and one
      for formatted array fields without labels.  Modify
      load123fld() to computed the proper length before 
      each call to ret123fv():                          
                                                        
         if (comprssed) field_length =                  
      cur_fm->cur_dr->fd_len;                           
         else           field_length = in_str_end -     
      *in_str;                                          
                                                        
         if (!ret123fv(...,field_length,...) {          
            return(0);                                  
         }
