FIPS PUB 123 Function Library
Readme File 
Subdirectory: <f123dir>/f123inc/

This subdirectory contains the FIPS PUB 123 Function Library include
files stc123.h and gvd123.h which are included in the Function Library
source code when compiled with the ANSI C Compiler.

The batch file <f123dir>/f123bat/f123comp.m can be invoked to compile 
the entire function library producing object code files in the subdirectory 
<f123dir>/f123obj/ and source listing files in the subdirectory 
<f123dir>/f123lst/.  Batch file <f123dir>/f123bat/f123comp.m contains 
a compiler option (-I) to locate the include files in this subdirectory.  
Users may find it more convenient to copy the contents of this subdirectory 
to the subdirectory containing other ANSI C include files.
