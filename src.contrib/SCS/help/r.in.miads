Miadin
    An SCS developed program for reading MIADS output files and
    converting them to a Mimportcell format. The program requires
    certain information before it can execute :
       1. the strip, line, and cell for a,
       2. UTM reference northing and easting.
    The user is expected to have this information prior to using
    the program.
    This program stands alone, however, conversion to GRASS use
    requires using the two macros "getstrip" and "joinstrip".
