NAME 
     v.psu.patch - Tool for creating a vector map from all digit
               psu files in current $LOCATION

DESCRIPTION
     v.psu.patch reads in all psu quad digit files, runs the patch.vect
     program, outputs the resultant patch file, creates a dig_cats
     category file for the patched map, and then runs support.vect.
     
     state_fips_num  - FIPS Pub. 6-3 number for the state.
     county_fips_num - FIPS Pub. 6-3 number for the county.
     county(yes/no)  - if county digital data used answer   yes;
                     - if county digital data NOT used answer   no.
     "
