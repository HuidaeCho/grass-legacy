NAME
     ps.map - Hardcopy PostScript map output utility.
     (GRASS Hardcopy PostScript Output Program)

SYNOPSIS
     ps.map
     ps.map help
     ps.map [r] [input=name] [scale=mapscale] [copies=n]
     output=name

DESCRIPTION
     ps.map produces an output file containing a PostScript
     program to produce hardcopy map products on your system's
     PostScript output device.  Output can include a raster map,
     any number of vector overlays, site data, text labels, and
     other spatial data.

     This program has 2 distincts modes of operation.  The
     command-line mode requires the user to prepare a file of
     mapping instructions describing the various spatial and
     textual information to be printed prior to running ps.map.
     The interactive mode (i.e., no command-line arguments) will
     prompt the user for items to be mapped and does not require
     the user to prepare a file of instructions.

     The command line flag is:

     r                 Rotate plot 90 degrees.


     The command-line parameters are:

     input=name        File containing mapping instructions.  (or
                       enter input=- to enter from keyboard).
                       These instructions are described in detail
                       below.

     scale=mapscale    Scale of the output map,  e.g. 1:25000
                       Default:  1 panel

                       This parameter is provided as a
                       convenience.  It is identical to the scale
                       mapping instruction described below.

     output=name       Name of output the file to contain the
                       PostScript program.


     Note: the user must select a PostScript output device using
     ps.select before running ps.map.

MAPPING INSTRUCTIONS
     The mapping instructions allow the user to specify various
     spatial data to be plotted. These instructions are normally
     prepared in a regular text file using a system editor.  Some
     instructions are single line instructions while others are
     multiple line. Multiple line instructions consist of the
     main instruction followed by a subsection of one or more
     additional instructions.

     Instructions that may be included in the subsection under
     several different main instructions are:

     where x y         The top left corner of the bounding box of
                       the item to be plotted is located x inches
                       from the left edge of the paper and y
                       inches from the top edge of the paper. If
                       x is less than or equal to zero, the
                       default horizontal location is used.  If y
                       is less than or equal to zero, the default
                       vertical location is used.

     font font name    The name of the PostScript font.  The
                       default is Helvetica.

     fontsize font size
                       The size of the PostScript font in 1/72
                       inch.  The default is 10.


colortable
     Prints the color table for the raster map layer anywhere on
     the page.

     USAGE:   colortable [y|n]
                where x y
                width table width
                cols table columns
                font font name
                fontsize font size
                color text color
                end

     The color table will display the colors for each raster map
     layer category value and the category label.  To get a color
     table, you must have previously requested a raster map
     layer.  The default location for the colortable is
     immediately below any other map legend information, starting
     at the left margin.  The default text color is black.
     Omitting the colortable instruction would result in no color
     table.  Note:  Be careful about asking for color tables for
     raster map layers which have many categories, such as
     elevation.  This could result in the printing of an

     extremely long color table!!!!!

     This example would print a color table immediately below any
     other map legend information, starting at the left margin.
     EXAMPLE:   colortable y



comments
     Prints comments anywhere on the page.

     USAGE:   comments commentfile
                where x y
                font font name
                fontsize font size
                color text color
                end

     The default location is immediately below the last item item
     printed, starting at the left margin.  The default text
     color is black.

     This example prints in blue whatever is in the file
     veg.comments starting at 1.5 inches from the left edge of
     the page and 7.25 inches from the top of the page, using a
     15/72 inch Helvetica Bold font.
     EXAMPLE:   raster vegetation
                comments veg.comments
                  where 1.5 7.25
                  font Helvetica Bold
                  fontsize 15
                  color blue
                  end

     Presumably, the file veg.comments contain comments
     pertaining to the raster map layer vegetation, such as "This
     map was created by classifying a LANDSAT TM image".



copies
     Specifies the number of copies to be printed.
