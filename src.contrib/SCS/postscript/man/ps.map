\fBps.map\fR [\fBinput\*=\fIname\fR] [\fBscale\*=\fImapscale\fR] [\fBoutput\*=\fIname\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ps.map
produces an output file containing a PostScript program to
produce hardcopy map products on your system's PostScript output
device.  Output can include a raster map, any number of vector overlays,
site data, text labels, and other spatial data.

This program has 2 distincts modes of operation.  The command-line
mode requires the user to prepare a file of mapping instructions describing
the various spatial and textual information to be printed prior to running
\fIps.map\fR.
The interactive mode (i.e., no command-line arguments) will prompt the
user for items to be mapped and does not require the user
to prepare a file of instructions.

The command-line parameters are:
.IP \fBinput\*=\fIname\fR 18
File containing mapping instructions.
(or enter \fBinput\*=-\fR to enter from keyboard).
These instructions are described in detail below.
.IP \fBscale\*=\fImapscale\fR 18
Scale of the output map,  e.g. 1:25000
.br
Default:  1 panel

This parameter is provided as a convenience.  It is identical to the 
.I scale
mapping instruction described below.
.IP \fBoutput\*=\fIname\fR 18
Name of output the file to contain the PostScript program.

.LP
Note: the user must select a PostScript output device using
.I ps.select
before running \fIps.map\fR.

.SH "MAPPING INSTRUCTIONS"
The mapping instructions allow the user to specify various spatial data
to be plotted. These instructions are normally prepared in a regular
text file using a system editor.
Some instructions are single line instructions while
others are multiple line. Multiple line instructions consist of
the main instruction followed by a subsection of one or more additional
instructions.

Instructions that may be included in the subsection under several
different main instructions are:
.IP \fBwhere\ \fIx\ y\fR 18
The top left corner of the bounding box of the item to be plotted
is located \fIx\fR inches from the left edge of the paper and
\fIy\fR inches from the top edge of the paper. If \fIx\fR is less than
or equal to zero, the default horizontal location is used.  If \fIy\fR
is less than or equal to zero, the default vertical location is used.
.IP \fBfont\ \fIfont\ name\fR 18
The name of the PostScript font.  The default is \fIHelvetica\fR.
.IP \fBfontsize\ \fIfont\ size\fR 18
The size of the PostScript font in 1/72 inch.  The default is 10.

.SH colortable
Prints the color table for the raster map layer anywhere on the page.

.TS
ll.
USAGE:	\fBcolortable\fR [y\*|n]
	\ \ \fBwhere\fR x y
	\ \ \fBwidth\fR table width
	\ \ \fBcols\fR table columns
	\ \ \fBfont\fR font name
	\ \ \fBfontsize\fR font size
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR text color
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

The color table will display the colors for each raster map layer
category value and the category label.
To get a color table, you must have previously requested a raster
map layer.
The default location for the colortable is immediately below any other
map legend information, starting at the left margin.
The default text color is black.
Omitting the \fBcolortable\fR instruction would result in
no color table.  \fBNote\fR:  Be careful about asking for color tables for
raster map layers which have many categories, such as elevation.
This could result in the printing of an extremely long color table!!!!!

This example would print a color table immediately below any other map legend
information, starting at the left margin.
.TS

EXAMPLE:	\fBcolortable\fR y
.TE


.SH comments
Prints comments anywhere on the page.

.TS

	\ \ \fBfont\fR font name
	\ \ \fBfontsize\fR font size
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR text color
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

The default location is immediately below the last item item printed,
starting at the left margin.
The default text color is black.

This example prints in blue
whatever is in the file \fIveg.comments\fR starting at
1.5 inches from the left edge of the page and 7.25 inches from the top of
the page, using a 15/72 inch Helvetica Bold font.
.TS

	\ \ \fBfont\fR Helvetica Bold
	\ \ \fBfontsize\fR 15
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR blue
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

Presumably, the file
.I veg.comments
contain comments
pertaining to the raster map layer \fIvegetation\fR,
such as "This map was created by classifying a LANDSAT TM image".


.SH greyrast
Selects a raster map layer for output in shades of grey.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBgreyrast\fR mapname\*|\fIlist\fR
.TE

For each 
.I ps.map
run, only one raster map layer can be requested (using either the
\fIgreyrast\fR or the \fIraster\fR instruction).


.SH grid
Overlays a coordinate grid onto the output map.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBgrid\fR spacing

	\ \ \fBnumbers\fR # [color]
	\ \ \fBfont\fR font name
	\ \ \fBfontsize\fR font size
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

The \fBspacing\fR of the grid is given (in the geographic coordinate
system units) on the main instruction line.  The subsection instructions
allow the user to specify
the \fBcolor\fR of the grid lines,
whether coordinate \fBnumbers\fR should appear
on the grid lines, and
if they
should appear every grid line (1), every other grid line 
(2), etc., and what color the numbers should be.  The defaults are
black grid lines, unnumbered.

This example would overlay a green grid with a spacing of 10000 meters
(for a metered database, like UTM) onto the output map.  Alternate grid
lines would be numbered with red numbers.
.TS
l l.

EXAMPLE:	\fBgrid\fR 10000

	\ \ \fBfont\fR font name
	\ \ \fBfontsize\fR font size
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR text color
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

If the \fIheader\fR instruction or the \fIfile\R sub-instruction is absent,
the header will consist of the map title and location, each centered on
the page above the map.
The default text color is black.

This example prints (in red) whatever is in the file \fIsoils.hdr\fR above
the map, using a 20/72 inch Courier font.
.TS

.SH labels
Selects a labels file for output (see manual entry for
.I p.labels).

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBlabels\fR  labelfile\*|\fIlist\fR
	\ \ \fBfont\fR font name
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

This example would paint labels from the labels file called
\fItown.names\fR.  Presumably, these labels would indicate the names of
towns on the map.

.TS
ll.
EXAMPLE:	\fBlabels\fR town.names
.TE


.SH line
Draws lines on the output map.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBline\fR east north east north
	\fBline\fR x% y% x% y%
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR color
	\ \ \fBwidth\fR #
	\ \ \fBmasked\fR [y\*|n]
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

The beginning and ending points of the line are entered on the main
instruction.  These points can be defined either by map coordinates or
by using percentages of the geographic region.
The user may also specify line
.B color,
.B width
in pixels,
and if the line is to be
.B masked
by the current mask. (See manual entry for \fIr.mask\fR for more
information on the mask.)
.LP

This example would draw a yellow line from the point x\*=10% y\*=80%
to the point x\*=30% y\*=70%. This line
would be 2 pixels wide and would appear even if there is a mask.

.TS
l l.
EXAMPLE:	\fBline\fR 10% 80% 30% 70%
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR yellow
	\ \ \fBwidth\fR 2
	\ \ \fBmasked\fR n
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

Of course, multiple lines may be drawn with multiple
.I line
instructions.


.SH mapinfo
Prints the portion of the map legend containing the scale, grid and
region information, on or below the map.

.TS
ll.
USAGE:	\fBmapinfo\fR

	\ \ \fBfont\fR font name
	\ \ \fBfontsize\fR font size
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR text color
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

The default location is immediately below the map,
starting at the left edge of the map.
The default text color is black.

This example prints (in brown) the scale, grid and region information
immediately below the map and starting 1.5 inches from the left edge
of the page, using a 12/72 inch Courier font.
.TS
ll.
EXAMPLE:	\fBmapinfo\fR

.TE


.SH maploc
Positions the map on the page.

.TS
ll.
USAGE:	\fBmaploc\fR  x y [width height]
.TE

The upper left corner of the map will be positioned \fIx\fR inches from
the left edge of the page and \fIy\fR inches from the top of the page.
If \fIwidth\R and \fIheight\fR (in inches) are present, the map will be
rescaled, if necessary, to fit.

This example positions the upper left corner of the map 2.0 inches from
the left edge and 3.5 inches from the top edge of the map.

.TS
ll.
EXAMPLE:	\fBmaploc\fR 2.0 3.5

.SH outline
Outlines the areas of a raster map layer with a specified color.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBoutline\fR
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR  color
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

.LP
Distinct areas of the raster map will be separated from each other visually
by drawing a border (or outline) in the specified
.B color
(default: black).
Note: it is
important the user enter the instruction \fBend\fR even if a color is not
chosen.
(It is hoped that in the future the outline of a different raster map
layer other than the one currently being painted may be placed on the map.)

This example would outline the category areas of the
.I soils
raster map layer
in grey.
.TS
l l.
EXAMPLE:	\fBraster\fR soils
	\fBoutline\fR   
	\fBcolor\fR grey

.SH point
Places additional points or icons on the output map.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBpoint\fR east north

	\ \ \fBcolor\fR color
	\ \ \fBicon\fR iconfile\*|\fIlist\fR
	\ \ \fBsize\fR #
	\ \ \fBmasked\fR [y\*|n]
	\ \ \fBend\fR	
.TE

The point location is entered in the main instruction line by giving either the map 
coordinates or by using percentages of the geographic region.
The user may also specify the point
.B color,
the \fBicon\fR file to be used to represent the point location
(see the the manual entry for
.I ps.icons),
the \fBsize\fR of the icon as a multiple of the size of the
pattern in the icon file (default is 1.0, aprroximately equivalent to a
10 point character),
and whether the point is to be \fBmasked\fR
by the current mask. (See manual entry for \fIr.mask\fR for more
information on the mask.)

This example would place a purple diamond (from icon file
\fIdiamond\fR) at the point (E456000 N7890000).  This diamond would be the 
approximately the size of a 15 point character
and would not be masked by the current mask.

.TS
l l.
EXAMPLE:	\fBpoint\fR 456000 7890000
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR purple     
	\ \ \fBicon\fR diamond

	\ \ \fBend\fR	
.TE


Of course, multiple points may be drawn with multiple
.I point
instructions.

.SH psfile
Copies a file containing PostScript commands into the output file.

.B Note:
.I ps.map
will not search for this file.  The user must be in the
correct directory or specify the full path on the \fBpsfile\fR instruction.
(Note to /bin/csh users: ~ won't work with this instruction).

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBpsfile\fR filename

.SH raster
Selects a raster map layer for output.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBraster\fR mapname\*|\fIlist\fR
.TE

For each 
.I ps.map
run, only one raster map layer can be requested.  If no raster map layer
is requested, a completely white map will be produced.
It can be useful to select no raster map layer in order to
provide a white background for vector images.

This example would paint a map of the raster map layer \fIsoils\fR.
.TS
l l.
EXAMPLE:	\fBraster\fR soils
.TE


.SH read 
Provides \fIps.map\fR with a previously prepared input stream.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBread\fR previously prepared UNIX file
.TE

Mapping instructions can be placed into a file and read into
.I ps.map.

.B Note:
.I ps.map
will not search for this file.  The user must be in the
correct directory or specify the full path on the \fBread\fR instruction.
(Note to /bin/csh users: ~ won't work with this instruction).

This example reads the UNIX file \fIpmap.roads\fR into \fIps.map\fR.
This file may contain all the \fIps.map\fR instructions for placing
the vector map layer \fIroads\fR onto the output map.

.TS
l l.
EXAMPLE: \fBread\fR pmap.roads
.TE

The user may have created this file because this vector map layer
is particularly useful for many \fIps.map\fR
outputs.  By using the \fBread\fR option, the user need not enter all the input
for the \fBvector\fR instruction, but simply \fBread\fR the previously prepared
file with the correct instructions.

.SH region
Places the outline of a smaller geographic region
on the output.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBregion\fR regionfile\*|\fIlist\fR
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR color
	\ \ \fBwidth\fR #
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

Geographic region settings are created and saved using \fIg.region\fR.
The \fIps.map\fR \fIregion\fR option can be used to show an outline of
a smaller region which was printed on a separate run of \fIps.map\fR
on other user-created maps.

The user can specify the \fBcolor\fR
and the \fBwidth\fR (in pixel units) of the outline.
The default is a black border of one pixel width.
.LP


This example would place a white outline, 2 pixels wide, of the
geographic region
called \fIfire.zones\fR onto the output map.  This geographic region
would have been created and saved using \fIg.region\fR.

.TS

.SH scale
Selects a scale for the output map.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBscale\fR \fIscale\fR
.TE

The scale can be selected either as:
.IP
a relative ratio, e.g. 1:25000;
.IP
an absolute width of the printed map, e.g. 10 inches;
.IP
the number of printed paper panels, e.g. 3 panels
.I
(at the present time, only 1 panel is supported);
.IP
the number of miles per inch, e.g. 1 inch equals 4 miles.
.LP

This example would set the scale of the map to 1 unit \*= 25000
units.
.TS
l l.
EXAMPLE:	\fBscale\fR 1:25000
.TE

.SH setcolor    
Overrides the color assigned to one or more categories
of the raster map layer.

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBsetcolor\fR cat(s) color
.TE


This example would set the color for categories 2,5 and 8 of the raster
map layer \fIwatersheds\fR to white and category 10 to green.
(\fBNOTE\fR: no spaces are inserted between the category values.)

.TS
l l.
EXAMPLE:	\fBraster\fR watersheds
	\fBsetcolor\fR 2,5,8 white
	\fBsetcolor\fR 10 green
.TE

Of course,
.I setcolor 
can be requested more than once to override the default color for additional
categories.  More than one category can be changed for each request by listing
all the category values separated by commas (but with no spaces).


.SH sites
Selects sites data to be placed on the output map
(see manual entry for \fIs.menu\fR).

.TS
l l.
USAGE:	\fBsites\fR sitemap\*|\fIlist\fR
	\ \ \fBcolor\fR color

	\ \ \fBsize\fR #
	\ \ \fBdesc\fR [y\*|n]
	\ \ \fBfont\fR font name
	\ \ \fBend\fR
.TE

The user may specify the
the \fBcolor\fR of the sites (see section on NAMED COLORS below);
the \fBicon\fR to be used to represent the presence of a site
(see the manual entry for \fIp.icons\fR);
the \fBsize\fR of the icon (number of times larger than the size it is in
the icon file);
and
whether or not the \fBdesc\fRription associated with each site is also to be
printed.
If the \fBdesc\fRription is to be printed, the \fBfont\fr name may be
specified.  The size of the font is proportional to the icon \fBsize\fR.
This example would paint a sites map with blue windmills (from an icon file created
by the user using the
.I p.icons
GRASS command) placed at all windmill locations (from a sites list).  These
windmills would be two times larger than the size of the icon in the
icon file and have descriptions from the sites list file printed beside them.

The user specifies where the text will be placed by
providing map coordinates or percentages of the geographic region map.
The text follows these coordinates
on the same instruction line.
More than one line of text can be
specified by notating the end of a line with
.B \en
(e.g. USA\|\enCERL).


The user can then specify various text features:

.B font:
cyrilc gothgbt gothgrt gothitt greekc greekcs greekp greeks italicc
italiccs italict romanc romancs romand romans romant scriptc scripts
(The default font is romans);

.B color
(see NAMED COLORS);

.B width
of the lines used to draw the text (to make thicker letters);

.B size
as the vertical height of the letters in meters on the
ground (text size will grow or shrink depending on the scale at which
the map is painted);

the highlight color (\fBhcolor\fR) and
the width of the highlight color (\fBhwidth\fR);

the text-enclosing-box \fBbackground\fR color;
the text box \fBborder\fR color;

.B ref.
This reference point specifies the text handle - what
part of the text should be placed on the location specified by the map
coordinates.  Reference points can refer to:
[lower\*|upper\*|center]\ [left\*|right\*|center] of the text to be printed;

.B yoffset,
which provides finer placement of text by shifting the
text a vertical distance in pixels from the specified north.  The vertical 
offset will shift the location to the south if positive, north if negative;

.B xoffset,
which shifts the text a horizontal distance in pixels from
the specified east The horizontal offset will shift the location east if 
positive, west if negative;

whether or not the text should be \fBopaque\fR to vectors.  Entering \fBno\fR
to the opaque option will allow the user to see any vectors which go
through the text's background box.  Otherwise, they will end at the box's edge.
.LP

This example would place the text
\fISPEARFISH LAND COVER\fR
at the coordinates E650000 N7365000. The text would be a total of
3 pixels wide (2 pixels of red text and 1 pixel black highlight), have a white
background enclosed in a red box, and be 500 meters in size.  The lower right
corner of the text would be centered over the coordinates provided.  All
vectors on the map would stop at the border of this text.

the highlight color (\fBhcolor\fR) for the vector lines;
the width of the highlight color (\fBhwidth\fR) in pixels;
whether or not the raster map layer is to be \fBmasked\fR
by the current mask
(see manual entry \fIr.mask\fR for more information on the mask);
and the line \fBstyle\fR.
The line style allows the vectors
to be dashed in different patterns.  This is done by typing a
series of numbers (0's and 1's) in a desired sequence or pattern.
Blanks and
non-digit characters are recognized as 0's. Using 0 would allow the
colors of the raster map layer (or the background color
if no raster map layer was selected) to show through.
.LP

This example would paint a map of the vector map layer
named \fIstreams\fR.
These streams would be a total of 3 pixels wide (the inner two pixels blue and
