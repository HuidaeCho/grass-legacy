This driver creates a portable pixmap file. The file will be called
paint.ppm is the user's home directory (unless the MAPLP envirnoment
variable is set, then that file is used).

Portable pixmaps are processed by the ppm* suite of utilities written
by Jef Poskanzer.  These utilities are NOT supplied with this driver.
If you have them then you can turn paint output into postcript by:

    ppmtops paint.ppm            (for color poscript printers)
    ppmtopgm paint.pgm | pgmtops (for black and white printers)

The maximum width and height of the output is set in Driver.sh as the
variables HEIGHT and WIDTH. You can change these if you wish.  I have
not figured out what combinations are good. No matter what values you
pick some window sizes will fit better than others.

If the values are too large, you can scale the output down on the
pp?tops commands, e.g.

    pgmtops -scale .7

If you want the output rotated by 90 degrees,

    ppmrotate 90 paint.ppm | ppmtopgm ...
