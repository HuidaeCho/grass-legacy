directory display/d.to.site:
  d.to.site - Creates a site_lists file. 
	      The user selects location in the currently selected display 
	      window and specifies an associated label.

directory display/devices:
  These are drivers for SCS equipment only, AT&T PC's.


directory misc/
  dotmaps - this is a preliminary attempt at random site generation
	    for statistical mapping, works BUT results are
	    subjective.

  m.bsplit - program to split large binary files, such a raster files,
             into 500,000 byte or less size files.  Primarily to 
             allow uucp (1 meg limit) movement of such files between unix machines.

  m.geo - interactive coordinate conversion program. 
        A. Given a Lat/Long will provide a selected projection's coordinates
        B. Given a selected projection's coordinates will provide the 
           cooresponding Lat/Long values.
        C. Reads from a file; to the screen or a file.
        D. Write from keyboard; to the screen or a file.

  m.qcalc: tool for determining raster resolution.

         -s <initial size> [up to size] [size increment]
            creates a table : 
            Cell Size       Sq.Ft.      Acres       Hectares

         -a <initial acres> [up to acres] [acre increment]
            creates a table : 
            Acres           Sq.Ft.      Acres       Cell Size

         -h <initial hectares> [up to hectares] [hectare increment]
            creates a table : 
            Hectares        Sq.Ft.      Acres       Cell Size


         conversion table for feet, meters, miles, and kilometers
         -c <ft> <value>
         -c <mt> <value>
         -c <mi> <value>
         -c <km> <value>

         Desk calculator
         -m <arithmetic>

  m.setproj - Automatically creates the PROJ_INFO and PROJ_UNITS 
	    files to record the projection information for a 
	    specified mapset. Support for projection transformation.

directory raster:
  r.in.erdas - This program is used to create a grass raster file for 
	       each band of data in the ERDAS file. The user can then 
	       execute the support and group commands in GRASS to 
	       associate these raster files together as a GRASS image group.

  r.in.miads - A program for reading MIADS output files and converting 
	       them to a r.in.ascii format. The program requires
               certain information before it can execute :
                1. the strip, line, and cell for a MIADS file,
                2. UTM reference northing and easting.
               This program stands alone, however, conversion to GRASS 
	       use requires using the two scripts "getstrip" and "joinstrip".

  r.reclass.scs - An interactive program to allow a user to use
		files of category names or values to perform the
		raster reclass. Used with lists generated by a DMBS.

directory sites:
 s.to.vect - converts a site_list into a vector(digit) file

directory imp_exp:
 gef_dig:
 v.in.scsgef - A program for reading SCS Geographic Export Format(SCS-GEF) 
	       digitial data files and converting them to GRASS digit 
	       files. The program will require some additional
	       information as it executes :
                   1. the FIPS state and county codes,
                   2. the import data format (old - 24 character records or
                        new - 40 character records),
                   3. the input coordinate system, and
                   4. the desired output coordinate system.
               This program stands alone, however, conversion to GRASS use
               requires using the script "make_1_gef" prior to v.in.scsgef.

               make_1_gef - combines the normal 3 file SCS-GEF data into 1
               data file.
 dig_gef:
 v.out.scsgef - A program for writting SCS Geographic Export Format
	       (SCS-GEF)  from GRASS vector data.
 dlg_dig:
 v.in.dlg.scs - A program for reading DLG data which contains NO
		attributes, but has a flat file containing name 
		attributes for the DLG data.
 dig_dlg:
 v.out.dlg.scs - A program for writting DLG output, developed for
		the specific SCS equipment used, also creates
		a flat file of name attributes for the DLG data.
 tig_dig:
 v.in.tiger.scs - A program for reading CENSUS tiger files, does
		NOT use a DBMS, creates vector maps directly.

 import:
 v.import - SCS user interface for import programs.
 xport:
 v.export - SCS user interface to export programs.

directory vector:
 v.extract - Automatically creates a new vector map from an old vector 
	    map, by user selected categories.

 v.make.subj - Program to read the category labels of all vector maps in 
	      a list, and create a common dig_cats "subject" file from them.

 v.merge - Program to modify vector file dig_att data for each mapset to 
	  agree with a common "subject" file. Then does a patch of all 
	  files in the list. This program was developed for the 
	  occurence of maps with similar category names, but different
	  category values.

 v.reclass - Automatically creates a new vector map from user 
	    selected categories, either names or values.

 v.proj - Program to provide multiple projection support for vector
	 map data, some 70 projections and some 15 speroids are
	 available. The program reads map data from mapsets in the
	 SEARCH_PATH, converting the coordinates to the proper map 
	 projection for the specified output mapset, and creates a
	 new map (in a new mapset if desired). Multiple projections
	 in the same mapset are NOT allowed.

 v.report - Lists statistics for vect map layers. 
           For areas: gives category, label, cnt, total area in acres, 
	   hectares, and sq. miles.  
	   For lines: gives category, label, cnt, total length in meters,
           feet, and miles.  
	   For sites: gives category, label, and cnt.

 v.rmedge - Automatically removes the outer edge of a vector map.


directory  libes:
  gis - A modification to src/libes/gis, two files cats.c and mapset_msc.c
        cats.c - modified to pre-alloc. memory for categories, this was
		 required for the AT&T 6386's.
        mapset_msc.c - modified for group ownership of GRASS files, rather
		 than individual user ownership.

directory  general:
  gis - SCS user interface to GRASS

directory  psu:
  SCS specific programs to support National Resource Inventory, 
 Primary Sample Unit digitizing. This is an application package
 of software.

directory  scripts:
  SCS specific scripts

directory  mapdev:
  SCS specific modes to v.digit and v.patch

directory man:
  Manual entries for SCS contributed programs

directory over_write:
  SCS programs which replace CERL programs of the same name, most
  operate the same, but have been enhanced. These should go away in
the next release.
