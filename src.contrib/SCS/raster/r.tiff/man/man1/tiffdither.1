.SH NAME
tiffdither \- convert a grayscale image to bilevel using dithering
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tiffdither
[
.B \-f
] [
.B \-o

.B \-p
] [
.B \-t
.I threshold
]
.I "file1 file2"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tiffdither
converts a single channel 8-bit grayscale image to a bilevel image
using Floyd-Steinberg error propagation with threholding.
By default the threshold value is 128; this can be changed with the
.B \-t
option.
.PP
The data in the resultant image are compressed either with
.SM LZW
or, if the
.B \-f
option is specified, with 
.SM CCITT
Group 3 fax encoding.
The
.B \-o
and
.B \-p
options are useful only when the
.B \-f
option is used;
they reverse the default
.SM LSB
to
.SM MSB
bit ordering in the output file and force zero-padding
before
.SM EOL
codes, respectively.
.SH NOTES
The dither algorithm is taken from the
.IR tiffmedian (1)
program (written by Paul Heckbert).
