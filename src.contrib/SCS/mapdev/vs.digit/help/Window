 Window Menu 

   This menu allows you to directly affect what is displayed on the
   screen.  The existing display will be changed on rewindowing.  

   If you want the window to remain each time you change the working 
   window, you can use the Display Options menu (Auto_window) which
   is available as an option in the Customize menu.
