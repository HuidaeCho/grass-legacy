s.voronoi - Uses a GRASS sites list  to  produce  a  Voronoi diagram.
s.delauney - Uses a GRASS sites list  to  produce  to Delauney triangulation.

Both of these functions utilize s.sweep (located in the ETC directory
instead of BIN_MAIN_CMD). s.sweep is a slightly modified version of sweep2,
which can be found on netlib sites (e.g., research.att.com).

-------------------------
This was developed from something called sweep2, 
which can be found on netlib sites (e.g., research.att.com). I
do not claim in any way to be an expert in computational geometry.
The only real additions that I made was the GRASS wrapper and making
a few cosmetic changes to Fortune's output routines.

There's a few places where the code needs cleaning up (i.e., there's a 
few areas where I need to do some re-allocation of memory, but I didn't get 
around to doing this). 

This is a complete re-write of the old s.voronoi. If you find any bugs,
let me know.
