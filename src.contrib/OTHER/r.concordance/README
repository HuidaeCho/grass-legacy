Here are the sources for r.concordance, a GRASS 4.1 module to perform
concordance and discordance analysis on raster maps. The operation of 
the analysis is described in the manual page in ./man. No other docs
are available; if something is unclear please email me and I'll try to
clarify. 

The software is written in C++ and needs a C++ compiler like g++ (which
I used). Some minor features are unimplemented. Runs can take a long
time according to the complexity of the input configuration. To compile,
simply type 'make' in the top directory after having browsed  the
Makefiles in ./lib and ./cmd and changed the necessary directories to
suit your configuration. If you need SUN binaries just tell me. 

No provision for automatic installation is done in the Makefiles. After
compiling, you will have to move the resulting ./bin/r.concordance 
executable and the man page ./man/r.concordance into the proper places, 
and run the MAKELINKS script.

Please read the copyright notice in README.lib.

I'll appreciate knowing how you are using this software and what do
you think about it. I am open to collaborations if you have some special
idea.
