Sites2cell is a non-interactive program to convert a site file to a
raster file. It has been created based on the modules in s.menu.
The quad size, i.e. the number of cells in the raster file that will take
on the value of one site, is fixed to 0, i.e. one cell.                    

sites2cell sites=Site_file_name cell=Cell_file_name

s.to.rast is a modified version of sites2cell. The call is now as follows:

s.to.rast -v input=Site_file_name output=Cell_file_name 
 
The '-v' flag is for verbose running of the program.
