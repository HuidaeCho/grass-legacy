This is a "pilot" version of a new display program.
It is interactive, of sorts, but with a terse command set.
Plots cell files, vector files, site files, and label files.

It has some nice features, such as:
    prompting for cell file names, vector files names and colors, etc.
    graphic window management
	creating new windows
        copying window contents to another window
	saving the window contents in the database for later use

    command scripts - what is displayed in a window is
	remembered and used to redraw the window when it is
	    moved, resized, etc.

	Also, when the cell file is changed, all the vectors are
	automatically redrawn. Same idea for vectors, or sites, or labels.

    it provides an interface to both the "window" and "d.window"
    program.
    
    etc.

It can also be used as a command line program as well.
