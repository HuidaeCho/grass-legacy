This release of GRASS is GRASS4.1 and dates from May 1993 (4.1.0)
with later updates.

These files comprise the entirety of GRASS4.1.5 (src, src.alpha,
src.related, src.contrib).  They are generated from a compressed
cpio file, split into 1-megabyte chunks.

To use these files, acquire all of them.  Then "cat" the files
together, uncompress the combination, and un-cpio the archive:

     cat s5.cpio.Z.???? > s5.cpio.Z
     uncompress s5.cpio.Z
     cpio -icdu < s5.cpio
 
In this way all appropriate subdirectories will be created.
