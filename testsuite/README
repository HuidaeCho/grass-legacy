This directory contains a basic testing suite for GRASS with DejaGNU.

It is currently work in progress by Andreas Lange.

If you want to contribute or have ideas, please contact me (by mail
andreas.lange@rhein-main.de) or on the developers list at
grass5@geog.uni-hannover.de.

How does this work?

To run the test on your host you must first install DejaGNU. DejaGNU
consists of a collection of expect scripts for a testing framework.
Additionally "expect" is required.

If you have build and installed the GRASS binary programs (with './configure
&& make && make install') you can issue a 'make check' and the tests in the
directories testsuite/grass.* are invoked. The output of the tests is in the
files grass.log (long format) and grass.sum (summary). One idea is to check
out the CVS-tree automatically, recompile it, run the tests and mail the log
file to a person who investigates the fail-cases.

How can i add my own test modules?

A test module consists of an expect script (*.exp) in one of the grass.*
directories or in a newly created directory with a name starting with
"grass.". The directories are read in alphabetical order and the scripts are
executed. Please refer to the DejaGNU documentation for the functions to be
called for pass and fail case.

Remind that grass is running (i. e. the env variables are set to a temporary
location) if the scripts are executed. A function grass_switch_location,
grass_make_location and grass_rm_location are provided for convenience (in
preparation).
