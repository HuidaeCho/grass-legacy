NAME
     3d.view.sh - Displays several 3-dimensional views of a
     landscape on the user's graphics monitor.
     (GRASS Shell Script)

SYNOPSIS
     3d.view.sh
     3d.view.sh help
     3d.view.sh file=mapname  ef=mapname  vh=viewing_height
     sv=sink_value  exag=exag  lf=line_frequency
     back=background_color

DESCRIPTION
     3d.view.sh is a Bourne shell (sh(1)) script that displays
     several 3-dimensional views of a landscape on the user's
     graphics monitor.  It erases the graphics monitor and then
     prepares it for the display of nine equally-sized frames.
     The user-specified raster map layer (given by file=name) is
     displayed using d.rast in the middle frame.  The remaining
     frames are then used to display 3-d perspective views.  The
     top middle panel is a view from the north, the top right
     from the north-east, the right from the east, and so on.
     Each is drawn with a call to the d.3d program.  The viewing
     angles are calculated automatically.  If options are not
     stated on the command line, default values will be used.
     These values are listed under Parameters, below.

     Parameters:

     file=mapname      Name of raster map layer to be displayed.
                       Default:  elevation

     ef=mapname        Name of raster map layer whose category
                       values will supply the elevation values
                       used to generate 3-d perspective views.
                       Default:  elevation

     vh=viewing_height Height (in meters) of the location from
                       which scenes will be viewed.
                       Default:  30000

     sv=sink_value     Sink factor value, causing the image to be
                       displayed lower, or higher, on the
                       graphics screen.
                       Default:  0

     exag=vertical_exaggeration
                       Vertical exaggeration factor of the values
                       in the elevation file.
                       Default:  3

     lf=line_frequency Contour intervals at which vector grid

                       lines will be drawn, in meters.
                       Default:  20

     back=background_color
                       Color of the background of the display
                       frames.
                       Options:  red, orange, yellow, green,
                       blue, indigo, violet, magenta, brown,
                       gray, white, and black
                       Default:  black

NOTES
     In the spearfish sample data base, the user must specify a
     viewing height when running 3d.view.sh.  Note also that the
     raster elevation map layers in the PERMANENT mapset under
     spearfish are named elevation.dem and elevation.dma.

     This program will not prompt the user for inputs;  if the
     user types 3d.view.sh without program arguments on the
     command line, default values will be used.

FILES
     This program is simply a shell script.  Users are encouraged
     to make their own shell scripts using similar techniques.
