NAME
     dcorrelate.sh - Graphically displays the correlation raster
     map layers in the active frame on the graphics monitor.
     (GRASS Shell Script)

SYNOPSIS
     dcorrelate.sh layer1 layer2 [layer3 [layer4]]

DESCRIPTION
     dcorrelate.sh is a C-shell (csh(1)) script that graphically
     displays the results of an r.stats run on two raster map
     layers.  This shell script is useful for highlighting the
     correlation (or lack of it) among data layers.

     The results are displayed in the active display frame on the
     user's graphics monitor.  dcorrelate.sh erases the active
     frame before displaying results.

     Parameters:

     layer1 layer2 [layer3 [layer4]]
		       The names of from two to four existing
		       raster map layers to be included in the
		       correlation.

NOTES
     This is a shell script that uses r.stats and the UNIX awk
     command to calculate the correlation among data layers, and
     uses d.text and d.graph to display the results.

     If three or four map layers are specified, the correlation
     among each combination of two data layers is displayed.

     This command is written for /bin/csh.  If your system
     doesn't support this shell, don't install this script.

FILES
     This program is simply a shell script.  Users are encouraged
     to make their own shell script programs using similar
     techniques.  See $GISBASE/scripts/dcorrelate.sh.
