NAME
     grass.logo.sh - Displays a GRASS/Army Corps of Engineers
     logo in the active display frame on the graphics monitor.
     (GRASS Shell Script)

SYNOPSIS
     grass.logo.sh

DESCRIPTION
     grass.logo.sh is primarily a demonstration of the GRASS
     d.graph program in a UNIX Bourne shell macro that generates
     the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers logo.  Users are encouraged
     to generate their own unique logos by writing similar macro
     shell scripts.  Examine the contents of the input file
     called grass.logo.sh located in the GRASS shell script
     command directory ($GISBASE/scripts) to see how the GRASS
     logo was generated using d.graph graphics commands.  The
     coordinates for this logo were taken from a drawing done on
     graph paper.

     To view the graphics described by this file use d.graph or
     d.mapgraph, making sure that a copy of this file is either
     in your current directory or is given by its full path name.

NOTES
     grass.logo.sh, like d.rast, will overwrite (not overlay)
     whatever display appears in the active graphics frame.

     This program requires no command line arguments.
