NAME
     hsv.rgb.sh - Converts HSV (hue, saturation, and value) cell
     values to RGB (red, green, and blue) values.
     (GRASS Shell Script)

SYNOPSIS
     hsv.rgb.sh file1 file2 file3

DESCRIPTION
     hsv.rgb.sh is a Bourne shell (sh(1)) program that converts
     HSV to RGB using r.mapcalc.  The Foley and Van Dam algorithm
     is the basis for this program.  Input must be three raster
     files - each file supplying the HSV values.  Three new
     raster files are created representing RGB.

NOTES
     Do not use the same names for input and output.

FILES
     This program is simply a shell script stored in the file
     hsv.rgb.sh under the $GISBASE/scripts directory.  Users are
     encouraged to make their own shell script programs using
     similar techniques.
