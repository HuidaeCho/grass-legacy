NAME
     bug.report.sh - A mechanism for writing, storing, and e-
     mailing to USACERL users' bug reports on GRASS 4.0 commands.
     (GRASS Shell Script)

SYNOPSIS
     bug.report.sh 4.0_program.name [program_arguments]

DESCRIPTION
     bug.report.sh is a Bourne shell (sh(1)) script which, when
     given a GRASS 4.0 program name, allows the user to complete
     a bug report for that program.  Completed bug reports can be
     e-mailed to the GRASS development group at USACERL, saved to
     a file in the user's home directory, or discarded.

     This program is not interactive;  the user must specify the
     name of a 4.0 program on the command line.	 Program
     arguments can optionally be entered by the user.

     Parameters:

     4.0_program.name  The name of an existing GRASS version 4.0
		       program tested by the user.

     program_argument(s)
		       Program arguments (parameters and/or
		       flags) for the 4.0_program.name tested by
		       the user.  The user should enter whatever
		       command arguments were actually run when
		       the program bug occurred.

EXAMPLE
     For example, if the user wished to complete a bug report on
     v.to.rast after running the program, the user might then
     type:

	  bug.report.sh v.to.rast

     A standard bug report form would then be displayed on the
     user's text terminal, containing the user's current GRASS
     region settings, and the machine name, GRASS data base,
     location, and mapset, on which the user is currently running
     GRASS.  Program parameters and flag settings, and the
     command entered by the user on the command line, are also
     automatically entered on the bug report form.  The user is
     put into a text editor and expected to enter additional
     information describing the nature of the bug found or the
     results of program testing.

     The user is then asked whether the completed bug report is
     to be:
	  1 - mailed to westerve@zorro.cecer.army.mil

	  directory
	  3 - both 1 and 2
	  4 - thrown away

NOTES
     This program prints whatever region settings, GRASS data
     base, location, and mapset are current when the user runs
     bug.report.sh.  The user is therefore advised to run
     bug.report.sh immediately after experiencing a program bug,
     to ensure that the settings current when the bug occurred
     are reported on the bug report form.

FILES
     This shell script is stored under the $GISBASE/scripts
     directory on the user's system.  The user is encouraged to
     examine the shell script commands stored in this directory
     and to produce similar scripts for their own use.	Users
     might modify this shell script to e-mail reports of program
     bugs to a local systems' administrator in addition to
     someone at USACERL.
