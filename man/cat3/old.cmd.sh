NAME
     old.cmd.sh - Provides the new GRASS version 4.0 program name
     for any program name in GRASS version 3.2.
     (GRASS Shell Script)

SYNOPSIS
     old.cmd.sh 3.2_program.name

DESCRIPTION
     old.cmd.sh is a Bourne shell (sh(1)) script which, when
     given a GRASS 3.2 program name, returns the name of the new
     GRASS version 4.0 program performing its functions.  This
     program is useful as a quick on-line cross-reference between
     GRASS versions 3 and 4.  This program is not interactive;
     the user must specify the name of a 3.2 program on the
     command line.


     Parameter:

     3.2_program.name  The name of an old GRASS version 3.2
		       program.


     Output will be in the form:

	  old 3.2 program name	replaced with:	new 4.0 program
	  name

EXAMPLE
     For example, to learn which GRASS 4.0 command performs the
     function of the GRASS 3.2 list command, the user might type:

	  old.cmd.sh  list

     The user would then see the following message displayed to
     standard output:

	  list	replaced with:	g.list

FILES
     This shell script is stored under the $GISBASE/scripts
     directory on the user's system.  The user is encouraged to
     examine the shell script commands stored in this directory
     and to produce similar scripts for their own use.
