NAME
     start.man.sh - Creates the template for a manual entry in
     standard User's Reference Manual format for a user-specified
     GRASS 4.0 command.
     (GRASS Shell Script)

SYNOPSIS
     start.man.sh 4.0_program.name

DESCRIPTION
     start.man.sh is a Bourne shell (sh(1)) script which, when
     given a GRASS 4.0 program name, creates a basic manual entry
     for that program in the same standard format as that used by
     the GRASS User's Reference Manual.	 The named program must
     already exist under a directory for GRASS main, alpha, or
     contributed source code.

     This program is not interactive;  the user must specify the
     name of a 4.0 program on the command line.

     By default, program output will be sent to standard output
     (i.e., displayed to the user's text terminal).  If the user
     wishes to save the manual entry created by start.man.sh,
     program output can be redirected into a file.  For example,
     the below command will create a manual entry for the program
     new.program, and save output to the file new.program.man in
     the user's current directory.

	  start.man.sh new.program > new.program.man

     Parameter:

     4.0_program.name  The name of an existing GRASS program
		       located in a source code directory for
		       main, alpha, or contributed software.

FILES
     This shell script is stored under the $GISBASE/scripts
     directory on the user's system.  The user is encouraged to
     examine the shell script commands stored in this directory
     and to produce similar scripts for their own use.
