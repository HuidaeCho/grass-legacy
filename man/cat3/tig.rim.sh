NAME
     tig.rim.sh - Generates various vector maps from a rim/TIGER
     data base.
     (GRASS Shell Script)

SYNOPSIS
     tig.rim.sh help
     tig.rim.sh dbname tractN1 tractN2 ...

DESCRIPTION
     tig.rim.sh is a shell script which queries information from
     a rim data base using the GRASS command v.db.rim, which is
     an interface between GRASS and RIM.  The dbname given on the
     command line should be the name of a rim data base created
     using v.in.tiger.	tig.rim.sh will create several new vector
     files.  Three of these are: a county outline map, a map of
     tract boundaries within the county, and a map showing block
     group boundaries.	For every tract number given on the input
     line, additional vector maps will be created showing: the
     tract outline, a block group boundary map for each block
     group within the tract, and a map showing block boundaries
     within each block group.  Output files will be named
     dbname.county, dbname.tract and dbname.bg for the map layers
     showing the county outline, the tract outlines within the
     county, and the block group boundaries within the county.
     The vector file showing the boundary for an individual tract
     will be named TtractN, where tractN is the tract number
     given on the command line.	 The vector files created to show
     an individual block group boundary and block boundaries
     within that block group will be named using the appropriate
     tract number and block group number as part of the name,
     with suffixes of .bg and .bk respectively.

     Parameters:

     dbname	       Name of an existing rim data base.

     tractN	       Number of a tract located within this
		       county.

NOTES
     This command must be installed separately as part of the
     package of routines dealing with the import of Census
     (TIGER) data.  It requires the use of rim and v.db.rim,
     which must be compiled first.

     You must include at least one tract number on the command
     line for this command to function.	 Use tiger.info.sh to
     obtain all tract numbers for a given TIGER type1 data file.

     If the master binary vector file created using v.in.tiger is
     modified after it is in GRASS, this program will probably

     not work.	In that situation, the processes from this shell
     script may simply be run by hand, using v.db.rim directly,
     but searching the old vector file to find lines for the new
     vector files without using the binary offset field
     (vectoff).

     Vector files showing the block boundaries within a block
     group may contain hydrology lines, which in fact define the
     edge of a census block.
