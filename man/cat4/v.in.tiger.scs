NAME
     v.in.tiger.scs - Converts ASCII TIGER data files from the
     U.S. Dept. of Commerce Bureau of the Census.
     (SCS GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.in.tiger.scs
     v.in.tiger.scs help
     v.in.tiger.scs [-cv] tig1=name tig2=name out=name
     cfc=name[,name,...]

DESCRIPTION
     This program imports Census line features from TIGER records
     type1 and type2 into GRASS vector format.  Both pre-Census
     and post-Census data formats can be used.  Specific Census
     Feature Class Codes (CFCC) can be extracted completely or in
     various combinations.  These codes are described in the
     TIGER/line Census Files 1990 documemtation available from
     the Bureau of the Census.  An additional feature code
     consisting of the three letters "BOU" may also be specified
     to extract a county boundary.  Condensed Record 1 files may
     be imported with the -c flag.  These files should be
     identified with a trailing "x" character on the filename.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flags:

     -c                Condensed TIGER file.

     -v                Verbose output.

     Parameters:

     tig1=name         TIGER file 1.

     tig2=name         TIGER file 2.

     out=name          New vector file name.

     cfc=name,name,... Specific Census Feature Class (CFCC)
                       codes.

EXAMPLE
     To extract all Primary (A1) and Secondary (A2) roads from a
     county's TIGER files the following command would be used:

          v.in.tiger.scs tig1=t12113.1 tig2=t12113.2 out=roads \
          cfc=A1,A2

     To extract all the Hydrographic features in a county's TIGER
     files with verbose output:

v.in.tiger.scs <contriGRASS Reference Man<contrib> v.in.tiger.scs



          v.in.tiger.scs -v tig1=t12113.1 tig2=t12113.2 out=hydro
          \
          cfc=H

     To extract the county boundary the command would be:

          v.in.tiger.scs tig1=t12113.1 tig2=t12113.2 out=bou \
          cfc=BOU

NOTES
     The TIGER files must in sorted order before being used.
     This can be done by using the following command:
          sort TGR12113.F21 -o t12113.1
          sort TGR12113.F22 -o t12113.2

     For consistency the sorted file should be written as above.
     It should consist of a 't' followed by the State and County
     FIPS code, then a '.' and then a value to identify the
     record number.
     The CFCC code 'BOU' used to extract the County Boundary
     should be used alone as it will result in a polygon AREA
     being created.
     Currently output is in UTM only.
