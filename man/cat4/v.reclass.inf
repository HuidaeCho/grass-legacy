NAME
     v.reclass.inf - Generate new vector map layer derived from
     attribute data in the currently selected database.
     (GRASS-RDBMS Vector Interface Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.reclass.inf
     v.reclass.inf help
     v.reclass.inf [-d] sql=name key=name type=name input=name
     [output=name]

DESCRIPTION
     v.reclass.inf generates a new vector map layer based on the
     results of one or more queries to the currently selected
     database.	The user constructs a series of mutually
     exclusive SQL select statments designed to return groups of
     records from the database. Each group of records should be
     internally consistent in terms of attribute characteristics
     specified by the user in the SELECT clause. These groups
     should also be mutually exclusive, thereby insuring that a
     row returned by one SELECT clause is not also returned by a
     subsequent SELECT clause. Each group of records therefore
     forms the basis for a single category in the resulting GRASS
     vector map. v.reclass.inf processes each SELECT statement in
     order returning groups of records which will form a single
     category in the resulting map.  As each SELECT statement is
     processed the group of records returned receives a common
     category value. The category value is incremented by one for
     each subsequent SELECT statment which is processed. The
     resulting reclass map will have one category for each of the
     original SELECT statements.

     For example, the rows associated with the first SELECT
     statement will be assigned to category 1, those associated
     with the second SELECT statement will be assigned to
     category 2 and so on. The output map will contain only those
     line segments associated with database rows returned by the
     SELECT statement(s).


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

     type=area/line.
	  Key column in db.

     input=map
	  Name of existing vector file to be reclassed using
	  query output.

     output=map
	  Name of new raster (reclass),	 file.


EXAMPLE: produces vector map of primary and secondary roads.
     v.reclass.inf sql=vect.sql key=tlid input=t.roads.inf
     output=t.roads.12

     vect.sql:

	  SELECT UNIQUE tlid,cfcc FROM type1
	  WHERE cfcc MATCHES "A1*"
	  ORDER BY tlid;
	  SELECT UNIQUE tlid,cfcc FROM type1
	  WHERE cfcc MATCHES "A2*"
	  ORDER BY tlid


BUGS
