NAME
     v.extract - Selects vectors from an existing vector map and
     creates a new map containing only the selected vectors.
     (SCS GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.extract
     v.extract help
     v.extractFR [-dn] type=name input=name output=name new=value
        [list=range] [file=name]

DESCRIPTION
     v.extract allows a user to create a new vector map layer
     from an existing vector map layer.  User provides the
     program with category numbers or option (n) names, input
     vector file name, an output vector name, and the type of
     input map.  There is an option (d) to dissolve common
     boundaries between adjoining map areas in the same category
     list.  The user may specify a file containing category
     values or names.

     Note:

          The dissolve option will work on only those areas which
          are in the given category list.  If a map area is
          inside (island) a listed category area and is NOT in
          the given category list, its boundaries are output to
          the resultant map.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flags:

     -d                Dissolve common boundaries (default is no)
                       .

     -n                Use category names NOT category values.

     Parameters:

     type=name         Select area, line, or site.
                       Options:  area, line, site

     input=name        Input vector map name.

     output=name       Output vector map name.

     new=value         Enter 0 or a desired NEW category value.

     list=range        Category ranges.
                       For example:  1, 3-8, 13
                       For example:  Abc, Def2, XyZ

     file=name         Text file name for category range/list .


EXAMPLE
          $GISBASE/etc/v.extract -d list=1,2,3,4 &\
          input=soils output=soil_groupa type=area new=1

     Produces a new vector area file soil_groupa containing
     'area' boundaries from soils with area category values of 1
     thru 4;  any common boundaries are dissolved, and all areas
     of the new map will be assigned category value 1.

          $GISBASE/etc/v.extract -dn list=Abc,Def1,12A,WWd &\
          input=soils output=soil_groupa type=area new=0

     Produces a new vector area file soil_groupa containing
     'area' boundaries from soils with area category names of
     Abc,Def1, 12A,WWd; these names correspond to values 1 thru 4
     of soils.  Any common boundaries are dissolved, all areas of
     the new map will be retain their original category values 1
     thru 4, in this case, since new was set to 0.

          $GISBASE/etc/v.extract -n input=soils
          output=soil_groupa &\
          type=area new=1 file=sample

     Produces a new vector area file soil_groupa containing
     'area' boundaries from soils.  No common boundaries are
     dissolved, all areas of the new map will be assigned
     category value 1.  The "names" (-n option) can be found in
     the file sample of the current directory.

          The format for "sample" is:
          Abc
          Def1
          12A
          WWd
