NAME
     ISMann2dig - Converts an ISM annotation data file to a
     binary GRASS vector (dig) file.
     (GRASS Vector Data Import Program)

SYNOPSIS
     ISMann2dig
     ISMann2dig help
     ISMann2dig input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     This program converts an ISM annotation data file into a
     binary GRASS vector (dig) file.

     ISMann2dig also creates a dig_att file containing the label
     information 'stripped' from the ISM annotation file.
     However, the user must run v.support (or v.import option 4)
     on the output file created by ISMann2dig to create a
     dig_plus file containing the file topology, before using the
     output file in v.digit.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of ISM annotation data input file.

     output=name       Name to be assigned to the binary GRASS
		       vector files created.

     If the user simply types ISMann2dig without specifying
     parameter values on the command line, the program will
     prompt the user to enter these.

NOTES
     GRASS does not currently support multiple line styles and
     colors, but any existing text labels in the annotation data
     file are used to identify unique attributes for dig vectors.
