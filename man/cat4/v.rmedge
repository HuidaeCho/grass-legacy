v.rmedge <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.rmedge



NAME
     v.rmedge - Selects edge vectors from an existing vector map,
     removes them, and creates a new vector map.
     (SCS GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.rmedge
     v.rmedge help
     v.rmedge input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     allows a user to create a new vector map from an existing
     vector map, however ALL OUTER boundaries will be gone. Any
     outer edge that needs to be retained will require adding
     another outside boundary, v.digit can be used to provide
     this additional boundary.


     Parameters:

     input=name        Name of vector input file.

     output=name       Name of vector output file.

NOTES
     When using v.digit to add an additional boundary to a map,
     it may be necessary to break the boundary of an existing
     area.  The user  *** MUST REMEMBER *** that breaking the
     boundary of a named area *** REMOVES THE LABEL ***, and the
     area *** MUST BE RE-LABELED *** prior to leaving v.digit;
     -OR-
     *** v.rmedge will REMOVE that area boundary ALSO ***

     This will result in MISSING data in a patching operation.
