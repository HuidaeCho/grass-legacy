NAME
     v.out.dlg.scs - Converts binary GRASS vector data to binary
     DLG-3 Optional vector data format.
     (SCS GRASS Vector Data Export Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.out.dlg.scs
     v.out.dlg.scs help
     v.out.dlg.scs input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS program v.out.dlg.scs allows the user to convert
     GRASS vector data to DLG-3 Optional format, for export to
     other systems, just as v.out.dlg does.  However, a flat
     ASCII file of labels and their coresponding dlg record
     numbers is created.  This flat file is used to provide the
     label information to other systems, since most do NOT
     support text attributes in a DLG import.

     The user can run the program non-interactively by specifying
     all program arguments on the command line, in the form:

	  v.out.dlg.scs input=name output=name


     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of the binary GRASS vector data file
		       to be converted to DLG-3 format.

     output=name       Name to be assigned to the DLG-3 Optional
		       format output file created.

     If the user does not give the names of an input and output
     file on the command line, the program will prompt the user
     to enter these names.

NOTES
     The v.out.dlg.scs program requires that the input vector map
     layer have full topological information associated with it.
     This means that the GRASS program v.support should have been
     the last program to have effected any changes upon the
     vector map layer before it is run through v.out.dlg.scs.  If
     this is not the case, v.out.dlg.scs will terminate with a
     message that v.support needs to be run.

     The output from v.out.dlg.scs will be placed in
     $LOCATION/dlg.  The output flat file from v.out.dlg.scs will
     also be placed in $LOCATION/dlg, with the extension ".att"
     attached to the same output name.
