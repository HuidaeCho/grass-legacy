NAME
     ISMcell2scat - Converts a GRASS raster map	layer into an ISM
     scattered data file.
     (GRASS Raster Data	Export Program)

SYNOPSIS
     ISMcell2scat
     ISMcell2scat help
     ISMcell2scat GRASS_file_name ISM_file_name

DESCRIPTION
     ISMcell2scat allows a user	to create a scattered data file
     for use in	Interactive Surface Modeling (ISM) from	an
     existing GRASS raster map layer.

COMMAND	LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     GRASS_file_name	 Name of a binary GRASS	raster map input
			 file.

     ISM_file_name	 Name to be assigned to	ISM scattered
			 data file created.

NOTES
     For each (x,y) position in	the original cell file,
     ISMcell2scat assigns an attribute for the scattered data
     file.  This program is useful when	the user wants to take
     advantage of smoothing capabilities of ISM.

     The user should note that the maximum ISM grid size is 512	x
     512, yet GRASS cell files are often much larger.
     ISMcell2scat currently resamples larger cell files	at 512 x
     512 resolution.  To avoid losing information, the user may
     want to resize the	grass cell file	prior to exporting the
     data.

     Since the scattered data file created by ISMcell2scat is
     placed in the current directory, the user should run
     ISMcell2scat from the ISM file directory or move the new
     file to the ISM file directory.  In order to use the
     scattered data file, the user must	also add it to the ISM
     table of contents (.toc file) by choosing option 3
     (edit/create file)	under FILE OPERATIONS.

     Graphics, Inc., Berkeley, California.
