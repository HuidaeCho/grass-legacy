NAME
     xganim - Raster File Animation Program

SYNOPSIS
     xganim
     xganim help
     xganim view1=name[,name,...] [view2=name[,name,...]]
	[view3=name[,name,...]] [view4=name[,name,...]]

DESCRIPTION
     xganim is a tool for animating a series of GRASS raster
     files.  At startup, a graphics window is opened containing
     VCR-like button controls for: rewind, reverse play, step
     back, stop, step forward, forward play, loop, swing, slower,
     faster, show filenames, current frame no., and Exit.  The
     image is displayed above or to the left of the controls.
     Each raster file is read into memory, then the animation is
     played once beginning to end.  The user may then replay the
     series or play continuous animation by using the buttons.

     The user may define up to four "views", or sub-windows, to
     animate simultaneously.  e.g., View 1 could be rainfall,
     View 2 flooded areas, View 3 damage to bridges or levees,
     View 4 other economic damage, all animated as a time series.
     There is an arbitrary limit of 100 files per view (100
     animation frames), but the practical limit may be less
     depending on the window size and amount of available RAM.

     The environment variable XGANIM_SIZE is checked for a value
     to use as the dimension, in pixels, of the longest dimension
     of the animation window.  If XGANIM_SIZE is not set, the
     animation size defaults to the rows & columns in the current
     GRASS region, scaling if necessary to a default minimum size
     of 600 and maximum of 900.	 The resolution of the current
     GRASS region is maintained, independent of window size.
     Resizing the window after the program is running will have
     no effect on the animation size.

     UNIX - style wild cards may be used with the command line
     version in place of a raster file name, but it must be
     quoted.

     Example:
     xganim view1="rain[1-9]","rain1[0-2]" view2="temp*"

     If the number of files differs for each view, the view with
     the fewest files will determine the number of frames in the
     animation.

     interface buttons may become difficult to see.
