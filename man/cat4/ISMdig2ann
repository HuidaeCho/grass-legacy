NAME
     ISMdig2ann - Converts a binary GRASS vector (dig) file into
     an ISM annotation file.
     (GRASS Vector Data Export Program)

SYNOPSIS
     ISMdig2ann
     ISMdig2ann help
     ISMdig2ann input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     ISMdig2ann converts a GRASS vector file in binary format to
     an annotation file for use in Interactive Surface Modeling
     (ISM).

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flags:

     -n		       Do not go interactive.

     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of the binary GRASS vector input file
		       to be converted to ISM annotation format.

     output=name       Name of the ISM annotation output file.

     If the user runs ISMdig2ann without giving the names of an
     input and output file on the command line, the program will
     prompt the user for these names.

NOTES
     ISMdig2ann produces windows to enable the user to select
     line and area attributes to be associated with the data in
     the annotation file.  By clicking on the attribute boxes,
     the user may select any of 8 different colors, 10 different
     line styles, three line widths, and indicate whether or not
     to display the label for each data attribute.  For area
     attributes, there are 22 different fill patterns in 9 sizes.
     The -n flag prevents ISMdig2ann from displaying the windows
     for attribute selection, enabling scripts to run
     uninterrupted.

     Since the annotation file created by ISMdig2ann is placed in
     the current directory, the user should run ISMdig2ann from
     the ISM file directory or move the new file to the ISM file
     directory.	 In order to use the annotation file, the user
     must also add it to the ISM table of contents (.toc file) by
     choosing option 3 (edit/create file) under FILE OPERATIONS.
