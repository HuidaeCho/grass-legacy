NAME
     m.setproj - Allows the user to create the PROJ_INFO and the
     PROJ_UNITS files to record the projection information
     associated with a specified mapset.
     (SCS GRASS Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.setproj
     m.setproj help
     m.setproj [set=name] proj=name

DESCRIPTION
     allows a user to create a new PROJ_INFO file in the
     specified mapset.	The file is used to record the projection
     information associated with the specified mapset.

     Note:

	  The "set" mapset must exist and must not contain a
	  PROJ_INFO or PROJ_UNITS file.
	  The specification of any projection other than ll and
	  xxx will generate a request to the user for a name of a
	  standard ellipse.
	  The projections of aea, lcc, merc, and tmerc will
	  generate a request to the user for the prime meridian
	  and standard parallel for the output map.
	  The projection of stp will generate a request to the
	  user for the state abbreviation and choice of zone for
	  the output map.
	  The projection of xxx will request mapgen proj
	  parameters.  See the mapgen proj documentation for the
	  uses of this software.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     set=name
	  Mapset in which the projection information file is to
	  be stored.

     proj=name
	  Map projection name.
	  Options:  utm, aea, stp, ll, lcc, merc, tmerc, xxx
