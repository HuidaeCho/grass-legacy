NAME
     ISMgrd2cell - Convert an ISM grid data file into a	GRASS
     (binary) raster map layer.
     (GRASS Raster Data	Import Program)

SYNOPSIS
     ISMgrd2cell
     ISMgrd2cell help
     ISMgrd2cell input=name output=name	mult=multiplier

DESCRIPTION
     ISMgrd2cell allows	a user to create a (binary) GRASS raster
     map layer from an ISM grid	data file with (optional)
     multiplier.

COMMAND	LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     input=name		 Name of ISM grid data input file.

     output=name	 Name to be assigned to	binary GRASS
			 raster	map layer files	created.

     mult=multiplier	 Each grid data	point is multiplied by
			 this (floating	point) number to produce
			 the raster values (default = 1).

     If	the user simply	types ISMgrd2cell without specifying
     parameter values on the command line, the program will
     prompt the	user to	enter these.


NOTES
     Since GRASS raster	values are integers, it	may often be
     necessary to use mult when	working	with small or closely
     spaced values in the ISM grid data	in order to produce a
     greater range in the raster file. Even though the user is
     allowed to	use a floating point multiplier, remember that
     the final raster value is truncated to an integer.
