NAME
     v.out.scsgef - Converts binary GRASS vector data to ASCII
     SCS-GEF vector data format.
     (SCS GRASS Vector Data Export Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.out.scsgef
     v.out.scsgef help
     v.out.scsgef input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS program v.out.scsgef allows the user to convert
     GRASS vector data to SCS-GEF format, for export to other
     systems.
     v.out.scsgef creates the SCS-GEF header, lines, text, and
     feature files. All files are created and placed in a
     $LOCATION/gef directory as a single UNIX file under the
     output name.
     The following is the SCS-GEF file structure:

          header record 1
          |     |
          header record n
          -head
          line record 1
          |      |
          line record n
          -line
          text record 1
          |      |
          text record n
          -text
          feature record 1
          |        |
          feature record n
          -feat

     The user will be required to use standard UNIX commands to
     separate this file into individual files as required by
     SCS-GEF specifications.

     The user can run the program non-interactively by specifying
     all program arguments on the command line, in the form:

          v.out.scsgef input=name output=name


     Parameters:

     input=name        Name of the binary GRASS vector data file
                       to be converted to SCS-GEF format.

     output=name       Name to be assigned to the SCS-GEF output
                       file created.

     If the user does not give the names of an input and output
     file on the command line, the program will prompt the user
     to enter these names.

NOTES
     The v.out.scsgef program requires that the input vector map
     layer have full topological information associated with it.
     This means that the GRASS program v.support should have been
     the last program to have effected any changes upon the
     vector map layer before it is run through v.out.scsgef.  If
     this is not the case, v.out.scsgef will terminate with a
     message that v.support needs to be run.
