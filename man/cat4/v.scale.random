NAME
     v.scale.random - Creates a site_lists file of randomly
     placed symbols within a GRASS vector area.
     (SCS GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.scale.random
     v.scale.random help
     v.scale.random [-n] map=name site=name dot=name
     [outdot=name]
	scale=value [cover=value] [size=value]

DESCRIPTION
     v.scale.random allows a user to create a GRASS site_lists
     file containing sites randomly placed within an area.  This
     program is designed as an interface to v.random to aid the
     user in determining the number of dots to locate.	This
     progam uses the same type of file listing the category and
     counts.  This file is then modified to try to produce a
     pleasing dot count for a map of a specified scale.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flag:

     -n		       Use category values, NOT category names.


     Parameters:

     map=name	       Input vector file name.

     site=name	       Output site_lists file name.

     dot=name	       Name of file containing labels and counts.

     outdot=name       Name of new file to contain scaled counts.

     scale=value       The denominator of the map scale.
		       Options:	 1 - 999999999999

     cover=value       The fraction of the most dense area to
		       cover with dots.
		       Options:	 0 - 1

     size=value	       The size of each dot, in centimeters.
