NAME
     d.param.scale  - Calculates surface parameters and features
     from a DEM and displays them in GRASS monitor. It allows
     interactive indentification of terrain parameters and
     features with a mouse. Reports membership classes for
     variable window sizes and their variance or entropy.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.param.scale
     d.param.scale help
     d.param.scale [-c] [-f] [-t] in=name out=name [s_tol=value]
     [c_tol=value] [size=value] [param=name]  [exp=value]
     [zscale=value]

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS program d.param.scale can be used to identify
     interactively terrain parameters and features with a mouse.
     Reports membership classes for variable window sizes and
     their variance or entropy.

PROGRAM OPTIONS
     d.param.scale can be run either non-interactively or
     interactively.  In non-interactive use, the user must
     specify the name of the raster map layer to be used for
     input on the command line, using the form in=name (where the
     name is the name of a raster map layer to be input.

Flags:
     If set, d.param.scale  constrains model through central
     window cell If set, d.param.scale	fixes the axis scale If
     set, d.param.scale creates text output of results

Parameters:
     that defines a `flat' surface (degrees) - default: 1.0
     surface -	default: 1.0 processing window (odd number only)
     - default: 15 elev, slope, aspect, profc, planc, longc,
     crosc, minic, maxic, feature, resid, moran, geary - default:
     elev (0.0-4.0) 1 implies a linear decay, 2 an inverse
     distance squared decay  - default: 0.0 (no distance decay).
     With:

	  elev:	    Generalised elevation value.
	  slope:    Maximum gradient at a point.
	  aspect:   Direction of maximum gradient.
	  profc:    Profile convexity (vertical in direction of
     steepest slope).
	  planc:    Plan convexity (contour curvature).
	  crosc:    Cross sectional convexity (tangent to
     contours, downslope).
	  longc:    Longitudinal convexity (perpendicular to
     contours downslope).

	  minic:    Minimum convexity.
	  maxic:    Maximum convexity.
	  feature:  Morphometric features:
		      peaks, ridges, passes, channels, pits and
     planes.
	  resid:
	  moran: Moran statistics
