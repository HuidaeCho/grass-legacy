NAME
     v.proj - Allows projection	conversion of vector files.
     (SCS GRASS	Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.proj
     v.proj help

DESCRIPTION
     allows a user to create a new vector map in another mapset
     with a different projection, from an existing vector map in
     the current or some other user-specified mapset.

     Note:  If the "outset" mapset is not available, v.proj will
     create it in the current location.	 If the	"outset" mapset
     exists, v.proj reads its projection information, and uses it
     to	convert	to the output projection.
     If	the "outset" projection	information is not available,
     v.proj runs the program m.setproj to create it.

EXAMPLE
     The current mapset	(Map_utm14) has	a utm projection, the
     coordinates are for zone14	meters,	and contains the map
     sample.  The user wants to	create a new map of sample in the
     mapset lambert (which is a	Lambert	Conformal Conic
     projection	mapset).

     The command:

	  v.proj map=sample outset=lambert

     will create a new map sample in the mapset	lambert, changing
     the utm coordinates of sample into	lambert	coordinates.  If
     the mapset	lambert	did not	exist, v.proj would have created
     it.
     v.proj will create	dig, dig_att, and dig_cats directories in
     the output	mapset,	if they	do NOT exist.  Map files for dig,
     dig_att, and dig_cats are also created for	the new	map
     layer.
