NAME
     r.reclass.scs - Create a new raster map layer based on an
     existing raster map.
     (SCS GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.reclass.scs
     r.reclass.scs help

DESCRIPTION
     r.reclass.scs is an interface to the GRASS r.reclass
     program.  The program will reclassify the category values in
     a raster map layer based on reclass instructions entered by
     the user.	The user can enter map reclassification rules to
     r.reclass.scs either from standard input or from a file.
     The program then issues r.reclass commands to produce the
     new reclassified raster map layer.

     Input to r.reclass.scs consists of a list of category names
     or category values that will be grouped into the same
     category in the output (reclassified) map.	 Only one
     category name should appear on each line of input.	 Input
     can be entered either interactively, or from a file.

     A file containing these reclass rules can be created using a
     text editor, word-processor, DBMS, etc.  It is no more than
     a list of category names which will have the same category
     value after the reclassification.
