NAME
     v.random - Creates a GRASS site_lists file of randomly
     placed symbols (sites) within a GRASS vector area.
     (SCS GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.random
     v.random help
     v.random [-nsv] map=name [site=name] dot=name

DESCRIPTION
     allows a user to create a GRASS site_lists file containing
     sites randomly placed within an area.  This program is
     designed for demographic map areas, and may NOT perform well
     for resource maps (very irregularly shaped polygons).  The
     user provides the program with:  a file (dot=) containing
     area category names [default] (the -n option allows the use
     of the area category number) and a count of dots for that
     name;  input vector file name (map=), and a site_lists file
     name (site=).  All sites in the site_lists file will have
     the same category code (1).  v.random is made to work with
     the mapgen mapping package to create special symbols at the
     site locations.


     Flags:

     -n		       Use category numbers NOT names.

     -s		       Determine optimum dot size.

     -v		       Verbose mode.


     Parameters:

     map=name	       Input vector file name.

     site=name	       Output site_lists file name.

     dot=name	       File name containing labels and dot
		       counts.

FORMATS
     The dotfile file format is:
	       -Using Names-	-Using Numbers-
	       area name_1:3	category_num_1:3
	       area name_2:15	category_num_1:15
	       area name_3:5	category_num_1:5
	       area name_n:54	category_num_1:54
