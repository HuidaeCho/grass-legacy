r.in.erdas <contrib>  GRASS Reference Manual <contrib> r.in.erdas



NAME
     r.in.erdas - Creates raster files from ERDAS files.  It
     creates one raster file for each band, and creates color
     support if an ERDAS trailer file is specified.
     (SCS GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.in.erdas
     r.in.erdas help
     r.in.erdas erdas=name [trl=name] prefix=name

DESCRIPTION
     This command prompts the user twice:

	  First the user is asked if he wishes to select a subset of
	  the bands available in the ERDAS file for output.
	  If unspecified by the user, all bands are used, by default.

	  Second, the user is asked if he wishes to select a subregion
	  of the image available in the ERDAS file.  If unspecified by the
	  user, the complete image is used, by default.

     Note:
	  GRASS raster files will be named prefix.band
	  Remember that it is necessary to run:
	  r.support: to create the histogram or change the color table.
	  i.group: to associate the individual raster files as an image group.
