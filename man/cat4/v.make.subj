     (SCS GRASS Vector Program)

     v.make.subj
     v.make.subj help
     v.make.subj map=name[,name,...] subj=name

DESCRIPTION
     Program to read the dig_cats file for each listed map.  The
     program then creates (or appends to, if the SUBJ file
     exists) a "subject" file of all of the labels, giving a
     unique category value to each.

     This program was designed to create a common category file
     from maps of areas that have the same category labels, but
     different category values;	 and that must be joined/merged
     together.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     map=name	       Vector map--source for composite.

     subj=name	       New SUBJ file name.
