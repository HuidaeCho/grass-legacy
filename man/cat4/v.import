NAME
     v.import - SCS user interface to GRASS import programs.
     (SCS GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.import
     v.import help

DESCRIPTION
     This program performs all of the processes that are needed
     to convert ASCII DLG files, binary DLG files, ASCII SCS-GEF
     files, ASCII ARC Ungenerate files, ASCII DXF files, and
     ASCII vector files into binary vector files.  It also
     creates support files, the dig_plus file and the dig_att
     file (only created when importing DLG, SCS-GEF, or ARC
     files). The dig_plus file contains topological information
     obtained by analyzing the vector file.  The dig_att file
     contains attribute information 'stripped' from the DLG file
     or SCS-GEF text data.  This dig_att file is created for
     vector files by the labeling function of the GRASS v.digit
     program.

     IMPORT FILES
     After entering the command  v.import, the user will be asked
     which type of file to import and create support files for:

     Import to GRASS Vector Format and Creates Needed Support Files
          1  -   ASCII DLG file  to GRASS Vector Format
          2  -   Binary DLG file to GRASS Vector Format
          3  -   ASCII DIGIT file  to GRASS Vector Format
          4  -   Binary DIGIT file to GRASS Vector Format
          5  -   ASCII SCS-GEF file to GRASS Vector Format
          6  -   ASCII ARC/INFO file to GRASS Vector Format
          7  -   ASCII DXF file to GRASS Vector Format
          8  -   ASCII TIGER file to GRASS Vector Format

          If numbers 1-3 or 5-8 are chosen, v.import will respond
          with the current database units (in feet or meters),
          and ask if the new vector file is in the correct units
          for the database location.  If the new vector file is
          not in the correct units, v.import will not allow it to
          be placed in the current database location.  For each
          database location, all data layer should have the same
          units.  If, for some reason, a data layer has different
          units than the rest of the data layers in the same
          database, a new database location will have to be
          created for it.

     ASCII DLG File to GRASS Vector
     Converts ASCII DLG files (such as those created in GRASS) to
     a vector file and creates the dig_plus and dig_att support
     files.  The user is asked several questions:



GRASS 4.1                U.S. Army CERL                         1






v.import <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.import



          1. The name of the DLG data file.

          NOTE: It should be available in the $LOCATION/dlg
          directory.  If the DLG data has an attribute flat file,
          it should also be in $LOCATION/dlg.

          2. Determine if this map is composed of Area or Line
          information.

          NOTE: Some machine-processed DLG files do not make the
          distinction between lines and area edges.  For example,
          in a roads map, where the desired information is line
          data, a downtown block surrounded by roads may be
          processed as an area.  Because of this, the user is
          asked to choose whether to give precedence to areas or
          lines.  If precedence is given to lines, the user
          should be aware that any lines that bound unlabeled
          areas in the DLG file will be stored as line data.  Any
          unlabeled areas would therefore be lost (this is only a
          concern when areas are unlabeled, labeled area
          information will be retained).  If precedence is given
          to areas, lines will be stored as boundaries to areas
          that are unlabeled.

          3. Determine if you want to snap nodes to other nodes
          within a threshold.

          NOTE:  BE CAREFUL!!!  This threshold is calculated
          using the scale of the original DLG or v.digit file.
          If the threshold is too high, excessive snapping may
          occur, destroying the file.  In general, users seldom
          need to snap nodes.  If snapping of nodes is desired,
          the user may want to run v.support separately.
          v.support allows the user to set the snapping
          threshold.

          4.  Does the DLG data contain GRASS category codes?

          NOTE:  Most non-GRASS computer systems will not be able
          to provide the necessary codes.  The flat attribute
          file serves this purpose.  If the answer to this
          question is NO:

          1) Enter a SUBJECT MATTER file name.
          A subject file will be used to assign GRASS category
          codes to the DLG data.  It is structured the same as a
          dig_cats category file.  It is suggested that a SUBJ
          directory be created in the GRASS location and a file
          containing all DLG attribute text labels by category be
          created.  This will be required to provide consistency
          across several maps (quads) within one location.  The
          user may use the vi text editor or the SCS macro



GRASS 4.1                U.S. Army CERL                         2






v.import <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.import



          make_subject to create it.

          2) Enter an ATTRIBUTE file name.
          This is the name of the flat file which will accompany
          a DLG from a non-GRASS system.  This file contains all
          of the DLG area numbers with a corresponding text
          label.

          3) Is the DLG data from an ARC/INFO system.
          ARC/INFO DLG data is handled in a slightly different
          manner.

          4) Does The DLG contain a Universe Polygon.
          Some DLG files may or may NOT have this and processing
          will be required to handle each case differently.

          This process is done in three phases:

          1. If the DLG does NOT contain category codes, then a
          category file from the attribute file is created.  Then
          the ASCII dlg file is converted to a binary dlg file.

          - OR -

          If the DLG does contain category codes, then the ASCII
          DLG file is converted to a binary DLG file.

          2. The binary dlg file is converted to a binary vector
          file, and the dig_att support file containing attribute
          information is created.

          3. The dig_plus support file is created by analyzing
          the vector file for topological information.

     Binary DLG File to GRASS Vector
     Converts binary DLG files (which should be in the bdlg
     directory) to a vector file and creates the dig_plus and
     dig_att support files.  The user is asked whether precedence
     should be given to Areas or Lines and if nodes should be
     snapped to other nodes within a calculated threshold.

          This process is done in two phases:

          1. The binary DLG (bdlg) file is converted to a binary
          vector file, and the dig_att support file containing
          attribute information is created.

          2. The dig_plus support file is created by analyzing
          the vector file for topological information.

     ASCII Vector File into GRASS Vector
     Converts ASCII v.digit files (which are located in dig_ascii



GRASS 4.1                U.S. Army CERL                         3






v.import <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.import



     directory) into binary vector files and creates the dig_plus
     support file.  Since a vector file keeps the distinction
     between lines and area edges, the user is not asked to give
     precedence to either.  However, the user will be asked if
     the user wants to snap from nodes to other nodes within a
     calculated threshold.

          This process is done in two phases:

          1. The ASCII vector file is converted to a binary
          vector file, and the dig_plus support file is created.

          2. The dig_plus support file is created by analyzing
          the vector file for topological information.

     Binary Vector File to GRASS Vector
     Creates the dig_plus support file.

          This process is done in one phase:

          1. The dig_plus support file is created by analyzing
          the vector file for topological information.

     Acsii SCS-GEF File to GRASS Vector
     Creates the dig_plus, dig_att, and dig_cats support files.
     Creates a registration coordinates file.

          Allows a user to create a GRASS vector file from a
          SCS-GEF format ASCII file.

          1.  The program will first request the name of the
          SCS-GEF file to be read in, it expects to find the data
          in the $LOCATION/gef directory.

          2.  The program will then request the name of a GRASS
          vector file.

          3.  The program will then request the name of a SUBJECT
          file.  A subject file will be used to assign GRASS
          category codes to the SCS-GEF data.  It is structured
          the same as a dig_cats category file.  It is suggested
          that a SUBJ directory be created in the GRASS location
          and a file containing all SCS-GEF text labels by
          category be created.  This will be required to provide
          consistency across several mapsets (quads) within one
          location.  The user may use the vi text editor or the
          SCS macro make_subject to create it.

          4.  The program will then read the SCS-GEF header
          information, interactively present information that was
          available, and request additional data of the user.
          These questions are :



GRASS 4.1                U.S. Army CERL                         4






v.import <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.import



                     Name of their organization. (from SCS-GEF)
                     Digitized Date.             (from SCS-GEF)
                     Map Name.                   (from SCS-GEF)
                     Map Location.               (from SCS-GEF)
                     Other Information.          (from SCS-GEF)
                     State FIPS code.
                     County FIPS code.
                     Present GEF Coord. System (table, stplane, ll, utm).
                     Coord. System Desired (utm, stplane, ll, albers).

          The program will then actively read the SCS-GEF data
          file and process it.

          Note: scripts contains SCS macro make_1_gef.  This
          macro makes one file out of the three (3) files found
          in SCS-GEF ( see SCS-GEF technical specifications for
          more information).  The macro must be run on each data
          set BEFORE v.import.

     ASCII ARC/INFO Ungenerate Format Files to GRASS Vector
     Creates the dig_plus, dig_att, and dig_cats support files.
     The program will prompt you to enter the names of ARC/INFO
     files to be imported to GRASS.  ARC/INFO vector files to be
     imported into GRASS must be exported from ARC/INFO using the
     ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.  ARC/INFO vector files which
     are to are to be imported to GRASS, must be either line or
     polygon coverages.  They must also be placed in a
     $LOCATION/arc directory.  The section of the ARC/INFO manual
     that cover the Ungenerate command describes how to export
     line and polygon coverages.

          A polygon coverage is represented by three files:

          1) a lines file, which contains coordiates of all the
          area edge lines;
          2) label-point file, which contains coordintes of
          label-points each with a unique label-point ID number.
          There is one label-point for each polygon defined in
          the lines file; and
          3) a label-text file, which associates label-point ID
          number with a category value and attribute text.

          A line coverage is represented by two files:

          1) a lines file, which contains coordinates of of the
          lines, each with a line-ID number; and
          2) a label-text file, which associates each line-ID
          number with a category value and attribute text.

          The program will start out by asking you which type of
          coverage is to be imported, as follows:




GRASS 4.1                U.S. Army CERL                         5






v.import <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.import



          IMPORTING A POLYGON COVERAGE
          The prompts that will be presented for coverage type
          "polygon."
                       COVERAGE TYPE
                       Enter "polygon" or "line"
                       Hit RETURN to cancel request
                       >
                  Answer "polygon"

                       NEATLINE
                       Do you want a neatline ?
                       Enter "yes" or "no"
                       >
                  If you answer yes then vectors representing
               a box around the data will be inserted into
               the resulting GRASS vector file, otherwise
               no neatline will be created.

     Next the program will prompt for the name of the lines-file
     containing the arc coodinates of the polygons.  The lines-
     file is created with the Ungenerate LINES option and is the
     same format as the map_name.pol file created by the program.
     The following is the prompt:
                   LINES FILENAME
                  Enter name of the file created with the LINES
                  option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.
                  Hit RETURN to cancel request
                  >
     The next prompt for coverage type "polygon" asks for the
     name of the label-points file.  The label-points files is
     created with the Ungenerate POINTS option and is the same
     format as the mapname.lab file created by the export.vect
     ARC program.  The following is the prompt:
                  LABEL-POINTS FILENAME
                 Enter name of file created with the POINTS
                 option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.
                 Hit RETURN if there is no such file
                 >
     The last prompt for coverage type "polygon" asks for the
     name of the label-text file.  This file associates each
     label-point ID number with a text string and is the same
     format as the mapname.txt file created by the export.vect
     ARC program.  The following is the prompt:
                  LABEL-TEXT FILENAME
                 Enter the name of a file that associates
                 label-point ID numbers with text label strings
                 Hit RETURN if there is no such file
                 >
     The program will then scan the label-text file to determine
     how many columns are in the file and to determine which
     column should be used as the label-point ID number column.
     The program will then tell you how many lines and columns



GRASS 4.1                U.S. Army CERL                         6






v.import <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.import



     are in the label-text file.  Next you will be prompted to
     enter the number of the column to be used for GRASS category
     values.  The category number column MUST contain only
     integers.
                   Enter the number of the column that is to be used
                   for GRASS category values:

     and the number the column to be used for GRASS attribute
     text.  The attribute text column can contain a floating
     point number, an integer, or a word.
                   Enter the number of the column that should be used
                   for GRASS attribute text:

     Once you enter the category and attribute column numbers,
     the program will begin conversion of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate
     files into GRASS vector format.

     IMPORTING A LINE COVERAGE
     First, you are prompted for the name of the lines-file
     containing the arc coordinates of the lines.  The lines-file
     is created with the Ungenerate LINES option and is the same
     format as the mapname.lin file created by the export.vect
     ARC program.
                    LINES FILENAME
                   Enter name of the file created with the lines
                   option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.
                   Hit RETURN to cancel request
                   >
     The last prompt for coverage type "line" asks for the name
     of the label-text file.  This file associates each line-ID
     number with a text string and is the same format as the
     mapname.txt file created by the export.vect ARC program.
                    LABEL-TEXT FILENAMES
                   Enter name of file associating line ID numbers
                   numbers with label text.
                   Hit RETURN if there is no such file
                   >
     The program will scan the label-text file to determine how
     many columns are in the file and will then tell you how many
     columns are in the label-text.  Next you will be prompted to
     enter the number of the column to be used for line-ID
     numbers.
                   Enter the number of the column that is to be used
                   for line-ID numbers:

     Next you will be prompted to enter the number of the column
     to be used for GRASS category values.  The category number
     column MUST contain only integers.
                   Enter the number of the column that is to be used
                   for GRASS category values:





GRASS 4.1                U.S. Army CERL                         7






v.import <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual    <contrib> v.import



     and the number of the column to be used for GRASS attribute
     text.  The attribute text column can contain a floating
     point number, an integer, or a word.
                   Enter the number of the column that should be used as
                   for GRASS attribute text:

     Once you enter the column numbers the program will begin
     conversion of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate files into GRASS
     vector format.

     DATA FILE FORMATS
     Following are examples of the data files discussed in the
     section above.

          LINES FILE, also known as xxx.lin or xxx.pol file.
          This type of file can be created in ARC/INFO by using
          the lines subcommand of the Ungenerate command.  Each
          line, or arc, is defined by a line-ID number, followed
          by a list of at least two easting and northing
          coordinate pairs, followed by a line with the word
          "END".  The file is terminated with the word "END".
          The line-ID number is only important for line
          coverages.  For a line coverage, the line-ID number is
          the number that associates each line with its attribute
          data.

          NOTES When importing a polygon coverage, the program
          finds the label-point ID in a label-text file by
          looking for the second column in the file that contains
          a "1" on line 1, and a "2" on line 2.
          If you are missing a label-points or a label-text file
          you can still import ARC/INFO data (but none of your
          lines or areas will be labelled).

     ASCII DXF Format Files to GRASS Vector
     Creates the dig_plus, dig_att, and dig_cats support files.

     ASCII TIGER Format Files to GRASS Vector
     This program imports Census line features from TIGER records
     type1 and type2 into GRASS vector format.  Both pre-Census
     and post-Census data formats can be used.  Specific Census
     Feature Class Codes (CFCC) can be extracted completely or in
     various combinations.  These codes are described in the
     TIGER/line Census Files 1990 documemtation available from
     the Bureau of the Census.  An additional feature code
     consisting of the three letters "BOU" may also be specified
     to extract a county boundary.  Condensed Record 1 files may
     be imported with the -c flag.  These files should be

     identified with a trailing "x" character on the filename.
     The TIGER files must in sorted order before being used.
     This can be done by using the following command:
          sort TGR12113.F21 -o t12113.1
          sort TGR12113.F22 -o t12113.2
     For consistency the sorted file should be written as above.
     It should consist of a 't' followed by the State and County
     FIPS code, then a '.' and then a value to identify the
     record number.
