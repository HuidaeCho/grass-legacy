NAME
     r.in.miads - Converts a MIADS output ASCII text file into an
     GRASS raster import (r.in.ascii) formatted file.
     (SCS GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.in.miads
     r.in.miads help
     r.in.miads input=name output=name strip=value line=value
     cell=value
	Northing=value Easting=value size=value

DESCRIPTION
     r.in.miads allows a user to create a r.in.ascii formatted
     ASCII file from a MIADS output printer format ASCII file.
     The program will actively read the MIADS data file,
     selectively remove and process each strip, creating a
     individual r.in.ascii formatted file for each strip, and
     finally create one category file for all strips.  The
     program also produces a report file summarizing all
     pertinent information for each strip.

     The resulting r.in.ascii files for each strip are then used
     in conjunction with the GRASS commands r.in.ascii and
     r.patch to create a complete raster file.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     input=name	       MIADS input file name.

     output=name       GRASS raster data output file name.

     strip=value       MIADSs strip number of reference cell.

     line=value	       MIADSs line number of reference cell.

     cell=value	       MIADS cell number of reference cell.

     Northing=value    UTM Easting at the cell reference.

     Easting=value     UTM Northing at the cell reference.

     size=value	       Cell size (length one side) in meters.


     SCS has developed scripts run.miads, getstrip, and
     strip.99s.	 These scripts make the MIADS to GRASS conversion
     easier.

r.in.miads <contrib>  GRASS Reference Manual <contrib> r.in.miads



	  SCS macro to perform the complete conversion of a MIADS
	  printer format data set to a GRASS raster file.

     getstrip -

	  Reads each MIADS strip file and converts it to a
	  independent GRASS data file.	Support may be run on any
	  one of these strip files;  however, there is no
	  category information available.  Each strip may be
	  viewed at this time with d.rast or d.display.

     strip.99s -

	  Special pre-r.in.miads macro that removes the 99's from
	  the MIADS data file.	This effectively removes border
	  information, replacing it with "no data" values.
