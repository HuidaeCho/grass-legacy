NAME
     r.answers - Menu-driven interface from GRASS to ANSWERS

SYNOPSIS
     r.answers

DESCRIPTION
     r.answers integrates ANSWERS with GRASS.  ANSWERS (Areal
     Nonpoint Source Watershed Environmental Response Simulation)
     is an event oriented, distributed parameter model that was
     developed to simulate the behavior of watersheds having
     agriculture as their primary land use.  Its primary
     applications are watershed planning for erosion and sediment
     control on complex watersheds, and water quality analysis
     associated with sediment associated chemicals.

     r.answers provides a menu of steps to complete the input
     required to run an ANSWERS simulation. Each simulation is
     treated as "project" by r.answers. The inputs collected for
     the steps completed are recorded under a project name, so
     that they may be copied or recalled for further completion
     or modification. The first menu one encounters when running
     r.answers includes functions to create a new project, work
     on existing projects, copy an existing project, and remove
     existing projects. The main menu (shown below) lists steps
     to be completed to prepare ANSWERS input, to run ANSWERS,
     plus other miscellaneous functions.

     Steps 1-11 record and display their status to the left of
     the step number. If a step has not been run, no status is
     displayed (as seen above). If the step has been successfully

     completed, the status will be listed as "done". In some
     cases, a change in one step will cause the need to run
     another step again, in which case the status will read
     "rerun". If a step has a status of "done" or "rerun", if it
     is run again it will attempt to offer previous inputs as
     defaults.


     Interface Operation Notes

     Throughout r.answers two primary types of interface/input
     are used:
     1) Text input that can be completed by hitting the RETURN
     key.  In most cases, if no text was entered, the given
     question or operation is canceled. Often times text input
     will consist of the name of a new or existing map or project
     name, in which case entering the word "list" will provide a
     list of currently used names.
     2) Text or menu options that can be completed by hitting the
     ESC (escape) key. This type of interface is used for menus
     or for entering tables of parameters. All menus have a
     default answer of Exit (0), so that by simply hitting ESC
     one may leave the program's menus. The following keystroke
     guide is helpful to know when using the parameter entry
     worksheets that use this interface:

     <RETURN> moves the cursor to next prompt field
     <CTRL-K> moves the cursor to previous prompt field
     <CTRL-H> moves the cursor backward non-destructively within
     the field
     <CTRL-L> moves the cursor forward non-destructively within
     the field
     <CTRL-A> writes a copy of the screen to a file named
     "visual_ask" in your home directory
     <CTRL-C> where indicated (on bottom line of screen) can be
     used to cancel operation

Description of Main Menu Steps
     The following section describes each option of the main
     menu.  All steps are verbose to provide as much immediate
     information as is practical, however it is necessary that
     the user also be familiar with the operation of ANSWERS.
     (Obtain a copy of the ANSWERS User's Manual (1991) by David
     Beasley and Larry Huggins. Available from Bernard Engel,
     Agricultural Engineering, Purdue University, W. Lafayette,
     Indiana, 47907).

     Steps 1 through 10 collect inputs (either maps from the
     currently available mapsets or other text/numerical inputs)
     in order to create or extract the necessary portions of
     ANSWERS inputs for that step. After steps 1 through 10 are
     done, step 11 can be run to assemble an ANSWERS input file.

r.answers <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual  <contrib> r.answers



     ANSWERS can then be run using the inputs, and the output
     from the simulation is captured and processed, as described
     under step 11.

     Step 1 Set mask, region, and resolution
     Map input: Watershed mask
     Other inputs: Project resolution, project region (optional)
     Description: All raster values in the input mask map greater
     than zero will be used to create reclass rules to set the
     project MASK to the watershed area. Each time the project is
     called, the MASK will be automatically set. Project
     resolution is input in meters and it used to set the size of
     the watershed elements to be used in the simulation. The
     part of this step attempts to find the minimal region needed
     to contain the watershed mask at the given resolution.  A
     region will be calculated to allow at least a one-cell
     border around the watershed area. This region is then
     presented in an input screen (much like that of r.region)
     for editing or approval. After the project mask, region and
     resolution are set, the information is recorded and will be
     reset automatically each time the project is called.  This
     step will create a new raster map in the user's current
     mapset entitled project name>.ELEMENT. This map will act as
     a reference to ANSWERS' methods of refering to raster cells.
     Raster values of the map will indicate element number, with
     the category description giving row and column numbers.  If
     any of the inputs in this step are subsequently reset, all
     other steps that may have been completed will be marked with
     a status of "rerun", since changing mask, resolution or
     region will require that inputs will have to be resampled.

     Step 2 Catalogue soils parameters
     Map input: Soils
     Other input: Soils parameters, tile drainage coefficient,
     groundwater release fraction.
     Description: This step prompts for the name of a soil map,
     then reads the map and lists all soil categories found in
     the watershed mask. For each soil found in the watershed,
     ANSWERS requires values for the parameters listed below. The
     Project Manager facilitates preparation parameters by input
     into a table.














GRASS 5.0beta2	      GRASS Development Team			3






r.answers <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual  <contrib> r.answers



+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Soil Parameters for ANSWERS (see ANSWERS Users Manual for more details) |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|1	  total porosity (percent pore space volume of soil)		 |
|2	  field capacity (percent saturation)				 |
|3	  steady state infiltration rate (mm/hour)			 |
|4	  difference between steady state and maximum infiltration	 |
|	  rate (mm/hour)						 |
|5	  exponent in infiltration equation				 |
|6	  infiltration control zone depth (mm)				 |
|7	  antecedent soil moisture (percent saturation)			 |
|8	  USLE 'K'							 |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     After the soil parameters are input, a screen will prompt
     for groundwater release fraction and tile drainage
     coefficient, which will apply to the entire watershed.  The
     tile drainage coefficient indicates the design coefficient
     (mm/day) of tile drains in those areas designated as having
     tile drainage.  The groundwater release fraction is measure
     of the contribution of lateral groundwater movement or
     interflow to total runoff.

     After this step is completed, it will provide an option to
     save the entered parameters to a file or printer for
     reference.	 ANSWERS soils inputs will then be extracted and
     stored.  This step may be rerun to change any of the
     information.  Previously entered information will be
     recalled and may be modified.

Step 3 Catalogue land use and surface parameters
     Map input: Land cover/use.
     Other input: Land cover parameters
     Description: For each category in the land use map found in
     the watershed, ANSWERS requires values for the parameters
     listed below. The Project Manager facilitates preparation
     parameters by input into a table.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Land Cover Parameters for ANSWERS (see ANSWERS Users Manual for details) |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|1	short (8 characters) description of land use and management	  |
|	(program will attempt to use map category description, if any)	  |
|2	mm of potential rainfall interception by land cover		  |
|3	percentage of surface covered by specified land use		  |
|4	oughness coefficient of the surface (a shape factor)		  |
|5	m of maximum roughness height of the surface profile		  |
|6	Manning's n (a measure of flow retardance of the surface)	  |
|7	relative erosiveness (function of time and USLE 'C' and 'P')	  |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     After this step is completed, it will provide an option to
     save the entered parameters to a file or printer for
     reference.	 ANSWERS cover inputs will then be extracted and



4		      GRASS Development Team	   GRASS 5.0beta2






r.answers <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual  <contrib> r.answers



     stored.  This step may be rerun to change any of the
     information.  Previously entered information will be
     recalled and may be modified.

Step 4 Identify elevation-based input layers
     Map input: Slope and aspect.
     Description: This step prompts for the names of previously
     prepared maps of slope and aspect for the project watershed.
     It is important to note that the required format of slope
     and aspect maps vary from that created by the r.slope.aspect
     program. Programs have been developed to process an
     elevation surface map and create ANSWERS slope and aspect
     map. The elevation map should be true elevations in meters.
     The elevation map can be "filtered" to remove "pits" and
     other potential problems to ANSWERS with the r.fill.dir
     program.  The r.direct program can be used to prepare an
     ANSWERS aspect map from the elevation layer created by
     r.fill.dir.  The r.slope program can be used to prepare an
     ANSWERS slope map from the elevation layer created by
     r.fill.dir.  ANSWERS requires slope values which are percent
     multiplied by 10 (so a slope map value of 35 indicated a
     slope of 3.5%).  The aspect map is a critical input to
     ANSWERS, since it defines the routing of runoff through the
     watershed, and should be carefully examined, since the
     r.direct program is unable to create flawless output. The
     d.rast.arrow and the d.rast.edit programs have been
     developed to assist this manual inspection and editing
     process.  When editing the flow direction map, pay careful
     attention to 1) cells on the watershed border, which all
     must flow into the watershed. 2) cells that will be declared
     as "channels" must flow directly from one to another
     (therefore it is suggested that channels should be
     identified in conjunction with this step). 3) flow from two
     cells must not point directly to each other (-><-) or
     otherwise form circuitous routes. In the final flow map, one
     should be able to start at any cell in the watershed and
     follow the flow directions from cell to cell until arriving
     at the outlet cell.

Step 5 Prepare rain gauge data
     Map input: Rain gauge areas (for multiple gauges)
     Other input: Rain gauge data
     Description: This step is designed to organize data used to
     describe the precipitation event to be simulated. ANSWERS
     permits up to four rain gauges to be used, each of which
     will require a table of rainfall data (time in minutes and
     rainfall intensity in millimeters per hour).  Data from at
     least one rain gauge are required. If more than one gauge is
     used, you will need to prepare a raster map of the watershed
     area to indicate which cells are to represented by a given
     gauge's data.




GRASS 5.0beta2	      GRASS Development Team			5






r.answers <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual  <contrib> r.answers



     To facilitate the modeling of a number of storms this step
     will prompt for a rainfall event name. The data tables
     entered will be stored in the ANSWERS database under the
     event name.

     Rain gauge data for ANSWERS consists two columns of numbers.
     The first is Time (in minutes) and the second is Rainfall
     Intensity (in mm/hour). Decimal values will be rounded to
     the closest whole number.	To input rain gauge data to the
     Project Manager, a file must first be prepared with rain
     gauge data.  If multiple gauges are to be used, one input
     file is still used, data for each gauge are separated by
     should occur sequentially by gauge; so that data for gauge 1
     is first in the file, data for gauge two is the second group
     of data, and so on.

     Example rain gauge data input files:

	+----------+------------------------------------------+
	|one gauge |	  two gauges			      |
	+----------+------------------------------------------+
	|  0	 0 |  0		 0			      |
	| 10	 3 | 11		 1	     data for gauge 1 |
	| 20	10 | 25		 7			      |
	| 35	22 | -1	  <----- delimiter		      |
	| 55	 9 |  0		 0			      |
	| 67	 4 | 15		 6	     data for gauge 2 |
	|100	 0 | 10		 4			      |
	+----------+------------------------------------------+
     This step will prompt to determine if multiple rain gauges
     are to be used. If so, it will prompt for the name of a map
     that represents areas to be assigned to the given gauges.
     The number of categories and their value should match the
     number of rain gauges.  Next the program prompts for the
     name of the rain gauge data file.	The program reads the
     file and displays what it found to the screen for approval.
     Having this, it will create the appropriate ANSWERS input
     files.

Step 6 Identify outlet cell
     Map input: none
     Other input: row and column number of watershed outlet
     element
     Description: ANSWERS needs to know the row and column number
     of the element at the watershed outlet. To facilitate your
     finding this information, The raster map <project
     name>.ELEMENT has been created.  The category values of this
     map are the sequentially numbered cells of the watershed.
     The category descriptions are the cell's row and column
     number. Using a tool such as d.what.rast, the row and column
     number of the outlet cell can be queried from the displayed
     element map.

r.answers <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual  <contrib> r.answers



Step 7 Specify areas with subsurface drainage
     Map input: Areas with subsurface drainage (optional)
     Description: This step offers a menu which allows the
     delineation of 1) all the watershed with subsurface
     drainage, 2) none of the watershed with subsurface drainage,
     or 3) areas with subsurface drainage specified with a raster
     map (all elements with a value greater than zero will be
     input to ANSWERS as having subsurface drainage.  Note: the
     drainage coefficient for areas with subsurface is set with
     the other soils parameters in step 2. If "all" or "none" of
     the watershed is simulated as having subsurface drainage, no
     input map is required; otherwise a raster map is used to
     specify areas with subsurface drainage.

Step 8 Catalogue channel parameters
     Map input: Channels
     Other input: Channel width and roughness coefficient for
     each category of channel
     Description: Watershed cells with a well-defined channel
     should be defined to ANSWERS. ANSWERS assumes the channel is
     rectangular in cross-section and is sufficiently deep to
     handle runoff.

     To prepare channel data for use with ANSWERS, the following
     is needed: a raster map layer of the channels in the
     watershed and a description of width (meters) and roughness
     (Manning's "n") for each channel category found in the
     layer.

     It is suggested that the aspect map from Step 4 be created
     in conjunction with the channel map, since ANSWERS will
     abort operation if a one channel element does not flow
     directly into another adjacent channel element.

Step 9 Define channel slopes
     Map input: Channel slope
     Description: An optional input to ANSWERS is the slope of
     channels.	If a channel slope input is not given, ANSWERS
     assumes the slope for the channel is the same as the
     overland slope for the element.

     If desired, a raster map may be used to define channel slope
     values.  To do so, a raster map should be prepared with
     category values for channel slopes in tenths of a percent
     (i.e. a category value of 31 would indicate a channel slope
     of 3.1 percent).

     Note: Even though channel slopes are an optional input to
     ANSWERS, this step must be run if only to say no map will be
     used.

Step 10 Specify BMP's in watershed



GRASS 5.0beta2	      GRASS Development Team			7






r.answers <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual  <contrib> r.answers



     Map input: Tile Outlet Terrace, Sedimentation Pond, Grassed
     Waterway, and/or Field Borders.
     Other input: Grassed waterway or field border width (meters)
     Description: This step provides a menu to prepare any or
     none of the four structural Best Management Practices (BMPs)
     that ANSWERS recognizes.  Many BMPs can be described to
     ANSWERS by changing variables describing the surface
     condition of the soil. Practices which are tillage-oriented,
     for example, are described in the soils and land use
     sections. Gully structures such as a drop spillway may be
     simulated by reducing channel slope. On the other hand, BMPs
     which are structural in nature require a change in land use
     (row crop to grass for waterways, for example).  ANSWERS
     recognizes four optional BMP structures. Even though the use
     of BMP structures is optional, this step still must be run
     to verify this.  NOTE: Since ANSWERS will recognize one BMP
     for a given watershed element, the most effective BMP should
     be used.  The following is a brief discussion of the BMPs:

     1. ANSWERS Tile Outlet Terrace Assumptions:

      - Trap efficiency of 90%
      - Only lowermost terraces are described
     Also, if a terrace exists only in a portion of an element,
     the assumption is made that all incoming flow is influenced
     by the BMP. Thus, elements which have only a small portion
     of the practice within their boundaries should not be given
     credit for the practice.

     2. ANSWERS Sedimentation Pond Assumptions:

      - Trap efficeincy of 95%
      - Only ponds in upland areas should be defined. In stream
     structures are treated differently.

     Also, if a pond exists only in a portion of an element, the
     assumption is made that all incoming flow is influenced by
     the BMP. Thus, elements which have only a small portion of
     the practice within their boundaries should not be given
     credit for the practice.

     3. ANSWERS Grassed Waterway Assumptions:

      - The vegetated area with in the affected element is no
     longer subject to any sediment detachment.
      - The model deliberately prohibits deposition within the
     vegetation of a grass waterway, since any waterway that
     effectively traps sediment would soon fill and become
     ineffective.
     For each category found in the layer, you will be prompted
     for width of the waterway




8		      GRASS Development Team	   GRASS 5.0beta2






r.answers <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual  <contrib> r.answers



     4. ANSWERS Field Border Assumptions

      - The vegetated area with in the affected element is no
     longer subject to any sediment detachment.
     For each category found in the layer, you will be prompted
     for width of the field border.

Step 11 Prepare ANSWERS input and run simulation
     Description: Steps 1-10 must have a status of "done" before
     this step can be run. (Even steps for optional inputs must
     be run before an ANSWERS input file can be completed.) Each
     of the prior steps will have prepared their part of the
     ANSWERS input. The first function of this step is to compile
     all the parts together.  Once the input file is complete,
     the simulation can be run.	 (NOTE: r.answers will call the
     ANSWERS program, which must be compiled as a part of the
     r.answers installation. The source code for ANSWERS should
     be part of the software distributed with r.answers.)  The
     error messages that ANSWERS may send to "standard output"
     are captured to a file by r.answers and displayed.	 If none,
     a message to that effect will be printed to the screen
     (although this doesn't mean that the simulation ran entirely
     error-free). The primary output of the simulation is
     captured to another file, then processed to separate it into
     component parts of 1) text - the verbose reiteration of the
     inputs and summary of watershed characteristics. This is
     useful for checking to insure that inputs were read in by
     ANSWERS properly; 2) outlet hydrograph data of rainfall,
     runoff and sediment yield and concentration. If these data
     are in order, they will be processed into a format readable
     by the d.linegraph program for display; 3) individual
     element net sedimentation showing sediment loss or
     deposition, if any, for each raster element in the
     watershed.	 Also, sediment deposition in channel elements.
     This step will prompt for names to use for new watershed
     maps it will create by extracting these data from the
     output. If the simulation event did not create sediment loss
     or deposition, or channel deposition for the scenario, the
     given map will not be created.  To find out how to access
     the output files, see the description of step 12, below.

Step 12 Miscellaneous Command Menu
     This step calls a menu that 1) allows access to the project
     files in the project database and to 2) a function that
     prepares a summary of the project's current status.

     The project database is where r.answers stores all the
     inputs, output, and other non-map data associated with the
     project. See the "FILES" section (below) for more
     information. There are two sections to the project data,
     since rainfall data are kept in a separate directory. When
     using this step to access database files, the program will



GRASS 5.0beta2	      GRASS Development Team			9






r.answers <contrib>   GRASS Reference Manual  <contrib> r.answers



     list both the project data and the rain data files, and ask
     which section you wish to access. Next you will be prompted
     for the name of the file to access. This request will be
     turned over to the "file handler program" which facilitates
     sending a file to the screen, copying to another file, or
     printing.

     The project status function available under step 12 creates
     a helpful summary of the project, and then passes control to
     the "file handler program" for display, copying to a file,
     or printing.


FILES
     Index of ANSWERS on GRASS database

     Each project will create and use the following files in
     $LOCATION/answers/<project name>/data.  For the most part,
     there isn't much to see, unless something is not working
     right. If that is the case, The first thing to check would
     be files listed here under the Output section or Input file.
     Furthermore, attempting to fix a problem by editing any of
     these files could prove to have unpredictable results. Once
     a problem is identified (with the input maps or parameters,
     most likely) fix the input maps if need be, run r.answers
     again to make any changes, such a using a different map or
     correcting parameters. Remember that if a map is changed the
     menu step that uses it must be run again to resample the
     inputs. Run step 11 again to create a new input file and re-
     run ANSWERS.
