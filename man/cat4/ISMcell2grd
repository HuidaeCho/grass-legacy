NAME
     ISMcell2grd - Converts a GRASS raster map layer into an ISM
     grid file.
     (GRASS Raster Data Export Program)

SYNOPSIS
     ISMcell2grd
     ISMcell2grd help
     ISMcell2grd input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     ISMcell2grd allows a user to create a grid data file for use
     in Interactive Surface Modeling (ISM) from an existing GRASS
     raster map layer.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     input=name		 Name of a binary GRASS raster map input
			 file.

     output=name	 Name to be assigned to ISM grid data
			 file created.

     If the user simply types ISMcell2grd without specifying
     parameter values on the command line, the program will
     prompt the user to enter these.

NOTES
     Since the grid file created by ISMcell2grd is placed in the
     current directory, the user should run ISMcell2grd from the
     ISM file directory or move the new file to the ISM file
     directory.	 In order to use the grid file, the user must
     also add it to the ISM table of contents (.toc file) by
     choosing option 3 (edit/create file) under FILE OPERATIONS.

     The user should note that the maximum ISM grid size is 512 x
     512, yet GRASS cell files are often much larger.
     ISMcell2grd currently resamples larger cell files at 512 x
     512 resolution.  To avoid losing information, the user may
     want to resize the grass cell file prior to exporting the
     data.
