NAME
     v.in.dlg.scs - Developed to handle DLG-3 ASCII import of
     data, specifically a DLG WITHOUT category/attribute codes.
     DLG files with this affliction will require a flat ASCII
     file having a 1 to 1 correspondence between DLG area number
     and a text label.
     (SCS GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.in.dlg.scs
     v.in.dlg.scs help
     v.in.dlg.scs [-uf] [dlg=name] [bdlg=name] [att=name]

DESCRIPTION
     Under normal circumstances the v.in.dlg program will handle
     the requirements of reading DLG data and creating vector
     maps from it.  However, v.in.dlg assumes that the DLG-s file
     will contain major/minor category numbers;	 this is NOT
     always the case.  In some instances, the user may want label
     names with the DLG data; the current DLG-3 specification
     does not provide that.  SCS has developed this program to
     meet that need.

     Notes:

	  This program is normally NOT called from the command
	  line.	 v.import will create the command string, then
	  execute it.
	  This program converts an ASCII DLG file to a binary DLG
	  file with attribute codes in the major minor fields,
	  and creates a dig_cats file with the correct code/label
	  correspondence. The program v.a.b.dlg must be run after
	  this program to create the GRASS vector files.
	  It is assumed that the DLG data file contains only one
	  set of geographic information; ie. areas, or lines, or
	  points.  This program WILL FAIL if mixed data is
	  encountered.
	  Degenerate lines are accepted in this program as point
	  data.

     DLG.att File format

	  The DLG.att attribute file format is simple:

	  field 1 - DLG [area|line|point] number
	  field 2 - Label


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flags:

     -u		       DLG file contains universe area.
