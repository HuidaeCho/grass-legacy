NAME
     r.rescale.inf - Generate a raster map layer in which the
     categories represent values in a database column which have
     been divided into equal interval units.
     (GRASS-RDBMS Raster Interface Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.rescale.inf
     r.rescale.inf help
     r.rescale.inf tab=name key=name col=name cats=name
     input=name output=name [join=tab,tabkey,pkey]

DESCRIPTION
     r.rescale.inf creates a reclassed raster map layer by
     dividing the values in a numeric column in the currently
     selected database into equal interval units. The number of
     resulting categories is determined by the user via the
     command line parameter [cats=]. r.rescale.inf evaluates the
     range of values for the database column and subsets these
     values into equal interval groups of records returned by the
     query. For example, if the database column contains values
     which range from 1-1000 and the [cats] value is equal to 10
     the resulting raster map layer will contain the 10
     categories:1=1-100, 2=101-200 etc. In other words, each
     category in the new raster map layer will represent a range
     of 100 values from the database column used in the rescale
     operation. The database column being evaluated must be
     numeric in type. To identify the data types of columns in a
     database table use the g.column.inf command with the [-v]
     flag. r.rescale.inf does not take outlying data values into
     account. Therefore, if the range of values for a database
     column contains a limited number of extreme values the
     resulting rescale operation will be skewed in the direction
     of these values.



COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters

     tab=database_table_name
	  Table containing a column linked to category values in
	  an existing raster map.

     key=database_column_name
	  Column corresponding to category values in an existing
	  raster map.

     col=database_column_name
	  Column to base rescale operation on which is numeric in
	  type.

     cats=value
	  Number of categories to define in the resulting reclass
	  map.

     input=map
	  Name of an existing raster file with category values
	  linked to a column in the currently selected databae.

     output=map
	  Name of new raster map.

     join=tab,tabkey,pkey

	  Tab is the table used to develop the current SQL query.
	  Tabkey is the database column used to relate
	  information in this table with data in the table linked
	  to the GRASS category file. Pkey is the associated
	  column in the table linked to the GRASS category file
	  which is related to tabkey in the current table.

	  For instance, assume that stf1_main is a table
	  containing column values associated with category
	  values in a the GRASS raster file blkgrp.ids. In
	  addition, assume that stf1_main is a table containing
	  attribute data on age in the column pop100. In this
	  example stf1_main is the table associated with the
	  GRASS raster map and tract_blck is the column linking
	  stf1_main to the GRASS category file. The column pop100
	  in stf1_main will be the basis for the rescale effort.
	  To specify the rescale:

	       r.rescale.inf tab=stf1_main key=tract_blck
	  col=pop100
	       cats=5 input=blkgrp.ids output=pop100.rescale


	  Specifying these conditions would insure that all rows
	  from table stf1_main which satisfy the query criteria
	  would be related to the spatial features in the GRASS
	  data layer via the GRASS category values.



BUGS
     None known.
