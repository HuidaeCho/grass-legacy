NAME
     m.bsplit - Splits a large (greater than 1,048,000 megabyte)
     file into smaller portions.
     (SCS GRASS File Management Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.bsplit
     m.bsplit help
     m.bsplit input=name [size=value] [prefix=name]

DESCRIPTION
     m.bsplit works much like the UNIX command csplit;  however,
     it was developed to be used on binary, not ASCII, files.

     The first parameter, size, has a default value of 500000.
     The user may assign larger or smaller values, as long as
     1000000 is not exceeded.

     The second parameter, prefix, is comparable to the UNIX
     csplit  command use of "x" as a prefix to output files.
     m.bsplit uses the default of "bx" as a prefix on output.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     input=name        The name of the binary input file to be
                       split.

     size=value        The value, in megabytes, of one of the
                       new, split-up files created from the input
                       file.
