NAME
     v.in.poly - Create a vector file of polygons centered on
     given locations
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.in.poly
     v.in.poly help
     v.in.poly [-t] [input=name] vect=name radius=value
	[segments=value]

DESCRIPTION
     This program creates a vector map of polygons of specified
     radius around center points which may be input as coordinate
     pairs from a file or from stdin.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flags

     -t	  Do not automatically build topology for the new map

     Parameters

     sites
	  Name of input file (omit or use - for input from stdin)
	  default: - (stdin)

     vect Name of new vector map to create

     radius
	  Radius of polygon's circumscribed circle
	  default: none

     segments
	  Number of straight line segments bounding the polygon
	  default: set to give perimeter point spacing of 0.02%
	  of the width of the current region based on the radius
	  given.  The smallest number of segments that will be
	  automatically used is six(6).	 Values down to 3 may be
	  explicitly selected on the command line or in input
	  lines (see below).  A value of 3 results in an
	  equilateral triangle, 4 a square, etc.


DISCUSSION AND ADDITIONAL INPUT LINE PARAMETERS
     If input is from a keyboard, a prompt will be given for each
     input line.  The input lines from the file or stdin should
     look like this:

       easting northing [label] [category desc]
		   or
       easting northing [#label] [category desc]

     The "#label" for is for center points piped from
     s.out.ascii, like this:

       s.out.ascii -d sitefile | v.in.poly vect=newvect
     radius=500

     The polygon (area) label and category description are
     optional.	"label" is an integer and the "category desc" is
     any text string.  If the label value is missing, the label
     value used is one greater than the last and the description
     is "n-sided polygon," where n is the number of bounding
     segments.	In this way a series of sequentially numbered
     polygons may be created by just giving the easting and
     northing center coordinates.

     Two optional command lines may be interspersed with the
     input lines containing the coordinate and optional label and
     category descriptions.  These lines begin with ".S" or ".R".
     Note the restrictions on values of radius and segments
     parameters below.

      .S 500
     Changes the number of straight line segments which bound the
     polygon to a new value.  With large values (greater than 20)
     the polygons will approximate circles.  The minimum value of
     3 will create an equilateral triangle.  Very large values
     are allowed, but the resulting "circles" may have more
     definition than is needed and will take lots of storage
     space for the vector map.

      .R 100
     Changes the radius of the circle to a new value.  Radius
     must be greater than 0.0; however, very small values may
     give meaningless circles and v.support may not be able to
     construct the topology if the points on the perimeter are
     too closely spaced.


BUGS
     Circles in Lat-Long locations are not really round.  Really
     large Lat-Long circles or polygons may look oddly misshappen
     when displayed.


SEE ALSO
     v.to.rast can be used to convert the polygons to raster maps
     for masking, etc.
