NAME
     v.in.sdts	- Imports SDTS vector data, conforming to the
     Topological Vector Profile, into GRASS, creating GRASS
     vector map(s) and associated attribute files ready to be
     installed in a relational database.
     (GRASS Vector Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.in.sdts
     v.in.sdts help
     v.in.sdts [-il] catd=name [output=name] [dbpath=name]
     [domain=name] [map=name] [theme=name] [manifold=name]

DESCRIPTION
     v.in.sdts creates one or more GRASS vector maps in the
     current mapset from a Spatial Data Transfer Standard dataset
     conforming to the Topological Vector Profile (TVP).  The
     program generates GRASS dig, dig_att, and dig_cats files.
     Also, if requested, files of attributes in database-ready
     form are created, along with scripts to create an approprate
     SQL-compliant relational database, and load the attribute
     files into the new database.  Special database-ready files
     of tables linking the attributes to the GRASS vector map
     layer or layers are also generated.

     The source SDTS dataset must be in the user's current
     directory.	 The files that make up the dataset are listed in
     the dataset's Catalog/Directory file (CATD); this file is
     specified by the user with the catd parameter.  v.in.sdts
     creates maps in your current mapset, and will only import
     map data if there is correspondence between the current
     mapset's coordinate system and that of the transfer set; in
     addition, for UTM (and State Plane), Zone designations must
     match.  These specifications can be displayed be running
     v.in.sdts in "Information only" mode.  "Information only"
     mode is automatically put in effect when there is a mis-
     match between source and target coordinate systems.

     An SDTS dataset may consist of one or several distinct map
     layers (or "2-D manifolds", in SDTS terminology), coinciding
     with one or more partitions of the earth's surface.  If a
     dataset contains more than one map layer, the grouping of
     object data into individual map layers, and of groups of map
     layers, is specified in the Catalog/Spatial Domain (CATS)
     file, in terms of "domain", "map", "theme", and/or
     "manifold" ("aggregate object").  If available, this
     information is displayed to the user in "Information Only"
     mode.  The user can then either (1) import all the map
     layers in a transfer at once, or (2) select a subset of the
     transfer consisting of one or more maps by specifying a
     domain name, map name, etc.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flags:

     -i		     "Information-only" mode.  Information about
		     the dataset and any individual map layers in
		     the dataset are displayed. No map layers or
		     attribute files are generated. Information
		     displayed includes basic identifying data
		     (title of transfer dataset, map date,
		     dataset creation date, scale, coordinate
		     system, etc.).  For individual maps, any
		     names found in the CATS file specifying map,
		     theme, domain, manifold, are given. Bounding
		     coordinates for each map layer are also
		     printed.
		     The program will also run in "information
		     only" mode if (1) no output name is
		     specified,	 or (2) the coordinate system,
		     or, in the case of UTM and State Plane,
		     Zone, of the dataset to be imported does not
		     match the current mapset.

     -l		     Import object link table(s) only; do not
		     create attribute tables.  If this flag is
		     set, and if dbpath is set, only the vector
		     map (dig, dig_att, and dig_cats) and the
		     file containing the database-ready table
		     linking the vector map with the attribute
		     tables will be created; the attribute files
		     themselves will not be created.  This option
		     is useful if the user wants to selectively
		     import data layers from an SDTS dataset with
		     multiple maps.  One map could be imported
		     with its object link table and the full set
		     of attributes; subsequent layers imported
		     with the "-l" option would avoid recopying
		     the full set of attributes.

     Parameters:

     catd=name	     Full name of SDTS file containing the
		     Catalog/Directory (CATD) module for the
		     source dataset. The file name format is
		     specified by SDTS and the TVP as
		     xxxxCATD.DDF, where xxxx are 4 digits or
		     upper-case letters or any combination
		     therof. The CATD file must be located along
		     with the rest of the SDTS dataset in the
		     current directory.	 The CATD file contains a
		     listing of all the dataset files, and is
		     thus the necessary starting point for the
		     transfer process.

		     Note that the same four-character prefix of
		     the CATD file is used for all files in the
		     SDTS dataset. This prefix is also used by
		     v.in.sdts for the naming of the output
		     attribute files (see The GRASS-SDTS User
		     Guide for details.)


     output=name     name for output vector map layer.	If the
		     SDTS dataset contains multiple maps, and if
		     no particular one is specified, causing all
		     the maps to be imported, maps will be
		     distinguished by name plus numeric suffix.


     dbpath=name     full path to location for placement of
		     database-ready attribute files preparatory
		     to their installation in a relational
		     database.	Path must exist and be writable
		     by the user. Setting the dbath parameter
		     causes database-ready files to be created;
		     otherwise they are not created.


     domain=name

     map=name

     theme=name

     manifold=name   if one or more domain, map, theme, or
		     manifold ("aggregate object") names are
		     given in the SDTS dataset Catalog/Spatial
		     Domain (CATS) file, map layers so designated
		     can be selected with the appropriate
		     parameter. "Information only" mode lists any
		     such names found in the CATS file.

SPATIAL OBJECTS IN SDTS AND GRASS
     SDTS and the Topological Vector Profile define two basic
     types of spatial objects: simple spatial objects, i.e.,
     lines,  polygons, nodes, etc.; and composite objects, which
     are made up of one or more other simple and/or composite
     spatial objects.  SDTS composite objects, which GRASS cannot
     handle directly, are imported as records in RDBMS-ready
     tables.  Details on the mapping of simple and composite
     spatial objects between SDTS and GRASS may be found in the
     GRASS-SDTS User Guide.

SDTS ATTRIBUTE IMPORT
     Only a brief explanation of SDTS attributes and v.in.sdts's
     handling of them is given here.  See the GRASS/SDTS User

     Guide for details.

     SDTS is capable of substantial attribute complexity.  SDTS
     distinguishes between two basic kinds of attributes: primary
     attributes are related directly to spatial objects (simple
     or composite), while secondary attributes are related to
     primary or to other secondary attributes.	In SDTS,
     attributes are stored in relational tables, and spatial
     objects may be linked to multiple attributes in one or more
     different attribute tables.  The schema of an SDTS
     dataset--the number and kind of attribute fields and
     attribute tables, and the relationships among attributes and
     objects--is not predefined by the Standard or the Profile,
     but is determined by the producer of the dataset.

     For most kinds of data likely to be available through SDTS,
     optimal access requires use of GRASS with a relational
     database management system.  In support of this, v.in.sdts
     imports SDTS attribute tables in a form ready for use with
     your RDBMS.  It also produces SQL-compatible scripts to set
     up the relational database and install the data.

     dig_att and dig_cats files: The program does generate
     dig_att and dig_cats files, and for relatively simple SDTS
     datasets, i.e., those with one-to-one object-attribute
     relationships with all object attributes in a single
     attribute table, an associated relational database is not
     necessary.	 In addition, for more complex datasets, the
     dig_att and dig_cats files are constructed in such a way as
     to facilitate post-import incorporation of selected data
     from the attribute files for use without recourse to a
     relational database.  Specifically, the contents of the
     generated dig_att and dig_cats files are as follows:

     dig_att	     Contains an entry for each attributed non-
		     composite object (line, polygon, point).
		     each entry will be assigned a unique
		     category integer value.  These integers, or
		     feature-IDs (FID), also uniquely identify
		     the same spatial objects, in the relational
		     database object link table.  For datasets
		     with one-to-one object-attribute
		     relationships and a single object-related
		     attribute module, only one database-ready
		     "object-attribute" file is created, and the
		     dig_cats records are given the same content,
		     as the generated database-ready file. Record
		     structure is as follows:

		     FID | obj_code | attr_code | attr. field 1
		     |...| attr. field n |

		     (obj_code and attr_code are codes, derived
		     from record IDs in the SDTS dataset, which
		     function as keys in the import relational
		     database. See The GRASS-SDTS User Guide for
		     details.)
		     For other datasets, the dig_cats file is
		     identical in content to the generated GRASS-
		     database object link table, and records
		     would have the structure:

		     FID | obj_code	or    FID | obj_code |
		     attr_code

     User Guide.


FILE NAMES
     vector map name: if the SDTS dataset contains a single map
     layer, or if a a single map layer from a multiple-map
     dataset, the name specified in output is used as is.
     Otherwise, the name is extended with integers to specify the
     individual layers.

     relational database file names: see the GRASS-SDTS User
     Guide.
