SYNOPSIS





v.sdts.meta
DESCRIPTION





This
menu-
driven
Tcl/Tk
program
enables
the
user
to
prepare
and
install
supplementary
metadata
and
data
quality
reports
for
a
vector
map
preceding
the
creation
of
an
SDTS
transfer
dataset.
With
v.sdts.meta,
metadata
and
data
quality
files
can
be
edited,
saved,
retrieved,
and
modified,
and
then
installed
in
the
GRASS
database
in
association
with
a
particular
vector
map
layer.
Subsequently,
v.out.sdts
will
incorporate
this
metadata
along
with
the
associated
vector
map
in
an
SDTS
transfer
dataset.
In
addition
to
the
five
data
quality
modules,
supplementary
metadata
items
currently
able
to
be
edited
and
installed
include
(1)
creation
date
for
the
original
source
map;
(2)
a
general
title
for
the
transfer;
(3)
a
general
comment
about
the
transfer;
(4)
name
of
geographic
datum;
(4)
and
(5),

the
kind
of
entity
contained
in
the
GRASS
vector
layer
being
transferred;
