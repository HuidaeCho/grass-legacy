Any and all changes should be made to the /man? files -- not the /cat? files.
(However, if a /man? file is removed, you will have to remove the corresponding
/cat? file by hand.)

After you add or modify a "manual" or "help" entry, type:

	gmake4.1

When removing a manual page entry, remove the relevant "manual" and "help" files.
GRASS 4.1 "manual" and "help" files are stored under:
  /grass.src/4.1/man/man?   and   /grass.src/4.1/man/help.src
Be sure to remove the corresponding /cat? entry as well.


To find out how well the manual entries correspond to the commands in the
bin directory, run the command:

	missing


To peruse an entry on-line, type:
	tbl.nroff ../man?/<entry> | more

To send it to the imagen (at CERL only):
	imagen ../man?/<entry>
