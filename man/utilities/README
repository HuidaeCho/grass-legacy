Any and all changes should be made to the /man1 files -- not the /cat1 files.
(However, if a /man1 file is removed, you will have to remove the corresponding
/cat1 file by hand.)

After you add or modify a "manual" or "help" entry, type:

	gmake4.0

When removing a manual page entry, remove the relevant "manual" and "help" files.
GRASS 4.0 "manual" and "help" files are stored under:
  /grass.src/4.0/man/man1   and   /grass.src/4.0/man/help1
Be sure to remove the corresponding /cat1 entry as well.


To find out how well the manual entries correspond to the commands in the
bin directory, run the command:

	missing


To peruse an entry on-line, type:
	tbl.nroff ../man1/<entry> | more

To send it to the imagen (at CERL only):
	imagen ../man1/<entry>
