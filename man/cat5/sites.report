EXPLANATION
     The machine readable report file consist of lines of text,
     with fields that are separated by the pipe character |.  The
     first field on a line defines the record type, and the
     remaining fields are defined according to the record type.


location
     This record gives the GRASS database location.

     location <name> <full name>

     <name>	     database location
     <full name>     long name for the location


mapset
     This record gives the GRASS mapset.

     mapset <mapset>

     <mapset>	     mapset under which the report was run


region
     The region records give the mapset region coordinates.

     region north <N>
     region south <S>
     region west <W>
     region east <E>

       <N>     north for current region (float)
       <S>     south for current region (float)
       <W>     west for current region (float)
       <E>     east for current region (float)


resolution
     This record gives the GRASS database resolution in meters.

     resolution <res>

     <res>     resolution of the database, in meters (float)


point
     These records describe the sites that were used in the
     report.  There is one 'point' record for each site.

     point <site_ref> <E> <N> <desc>

sites.report	      GRASS Reference Manual	     sites.report



     <site_ref>	    a reference number, used by other lines
		    in the report to reference this site
     <E>	    site easting
     <N>	    site northing
     <desc>	    a description of the site (usually an site number)


layer
     These records describe the map layers that were used in the
     report.  There is one 'layer' record for each layer.

     layer <layer_ref> <name> <full_name>

     <layer_ref>    a reference number, used by other lines
		    in the report to reference this layer
     <name>	    name of the map layer (raster file name)
     <full name>    full name (title of raster file)


cat
     These records give information about each category in each
     layer.

     cat <layer_ref> <cat> <count> <name>

     <layer_ref>    reference number of the layer
     <cat>	    category number
     <count>	    number of times this category occurred
     <name>	    full name of the category


matrix size
     This record gives the number of cells in each site.

     matrix size <matrix size>

     <matrix size>  number of cells per site.


matrix
     These records describe the locations of each cell in the
     site relative to the center of the site.

     matrix <ew_disp> <ns_disp> ...

     <ew_disp>	    east-west displacement from the site
     <ns_disp>	    north-south displacement from the site

     The displacements are in units of 1 cell, which is equal to
     the resolution of the database.  They are paired, and there
     will be <matrix size> pairs.  To compute the coordinates for
     the cell:

sites.report	      GRASS Reference Manual	     sites.report



	 north = site_north - <ns_disp> * resolution
	 east  = site_east  + <ew_disp> * resolution


data
     This is the site data. There is one 'data' record for each
     site for each layer.  The <cat> field is repeated <matrix
     size> times.

     data <layer_ref> <site_ref> <cat> ...

     <layer_ref>     reference number of the layer
     <site_ref>	     reference number of the site
     <cat>	     category which occurred
