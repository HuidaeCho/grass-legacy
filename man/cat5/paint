NAME
     paint - Description of hardcopy color output system for
     GRASS.

INTRODUCTION
     The paint system allows the user to produce color hardcopy
     maps of vector, raster, and sites file data at any scale.
     For a discussion of the GRASS paint functions, see the
     manual entries for p.chart, p.colors, p.icons, p.labels,
     p.map, p.screen, and p.select.

PAINT DEVICES
     The GRASS paint system supports multiple color printers
     using a device driver concept.  The paint (p.) functions
     listed above send graphics requests to device-dependent
     paint drivers.  These drivers translate the application
     requests into device-dependent requests to produce hardcopy
     maps.

INSTALLING A PAINT DRIVER
     A number of paint drivers have been distributed with GRASS.
     The installation of a driver is a 2 step process.	The first
     involves identifying the driver(s) which correspond to
     printer(s) connected to your system and compiling those
     drivers.  The second involves telling each driver which i/o
     port it is to use.


     1	The source code for the drivers lives in
	$GISBASE/../src/paint/Drivers (The variable GISBASE
	refers to the directory in which GRASS is installed on
	your system.)

	The selection and compilation of the drivers is done when
	GRASS is compiled as a whole.

     2	The port configuration is handled using the UNIX ln
	command.

	Each driver expects to send its output to /dev/driver.
	For example, the tek4695 driver expects to find a
	tektronix 4695 (or 4696) printer on /dev/tek4695.

	Suppose the printer is actually on /dev/tty10.	Then, a
	link named /dev/tek4695 is made to /dev/tty10:

	       ln /dev/tty10 /dev/tek4695

NOTES
     There are 2 drivers which do not use i/o ports.  One is the
     preview driver, which sends its output to the graphics
     screen instead of a hardcopy printer.  This driver is very

     handy and should definitely be compiled on your system.

     The other is the null driver, which is used for debugging
     purposes and probably should not be compiled on your system.

     If you compile either of these drivers, you shouldn't create
     a /dev file for them.
