NAME
     monitorcap - Description of device driver database file
     format.

DESCRIPTION
     The d.mon command and all graphics commands access a device
     driver database stored in the file $GISBASE/etc/monitorcap.
     This file contains a line for each graphics monitor on the
     system.  Each line contains 6 fields separated by colons:


     name	the name by which the user identifies the driver

     program	the full pathname of the executable driver or a
		pathname relative to $GISBASE

     description
		A short 4 or 5 word description of the driver.

     fifos	full pathnames to the input and output fifos over
		which the driver communicates with the libraries

     tty	the name of the tty from which the driver must be
		started, or empty if there is no such restriction

     msg	a message to print to the user if an attempt is
		made to start the driver from the wrong tty.

EXAMPLE
     The following is an example of a single monitor system.  The
     driver may be started from any terminal and uses /dev/fifo.a
     and /dev/fifo.b for communication with application programs:

     x:driver/X:graphics monitor:/dev/fifo.a /dev/fifo.b::any terminal

     This example has 2 monitors on the system, using the same
     device driver.  Note that each has a different name field
     and uses a different pair of fifos.  Also, each must be
     started on a specific terminal:

     1:driver/X:monitor 1:/dev/fifo.1a /dev/fifo.1b:/dev/tty8:tty8
     2:driver/X:monitor 2:/dev/fifo.2a /dev/fifo.2b:/dev/tty10:tty10

NOTES
     Each line in this file must refer to a valid driver.  No
     comment lines are supported.  Also, no blank lines are
     allowed.
