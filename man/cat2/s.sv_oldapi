NAME
     s.sv - Sample semivariogram of a GRASS sites list.
     (GRASS Sites Program)

SYNOPSIS
     s.sv
     s.sv help
     s.sv [-alq] [sites=name] lag=value	[lagtol=value]
     [direction=value] [angtol=value] [graph=name]

DESCRIPTION
     s.sv calculates a sample semivariogram and	either plots it
     or	writes it to standard output.

     For more information, refer to the	tutorial or see	the
     example below.

OPTIONS
     Flags:

     -q		       Quiet. Cut out the chatter.

     -p		       Plot the	sample semivariogram in	the GRASS
		       graphics	window (requires g.gnuplot).

     Parameters:

     sites=name	       Name of an existing sites file with
		       floating-point attributes (the variable
		       for which we are	calculating
		       semivariance). Default is standard input
		       with no field separators.

     lag=value	       Nominal lag distance.

     lagtol=value      Tolerance on lag	distance. Default is half
		       of nominal distance.

     direction=value   Direction of semivariogram. Default is
		       omnidirectional semivariogram.

     angtol=value      Angular tolerance on direction.

     graph=name	       Basename	to save	graphing data/commands
		       files.  Graphs are saved	in the current
		       working directory with the extensions .gp
		       and .dat. Implies the -p	flag. If
		       unspecified, semivariogram is written to
		       standard	output.

NOTES
     Without the -p flag, three	columns	of data	are written to

     standard output: lag distance (h),	semivariogram value
     (gamma), and the number of	data pairs used	to compute it
     (N(h)). When the graph parameter is set, these same three
     columns of	data are written to name.dat. Therefore, to
     replot a sample semivariogram, use:

	  g.gnuplot name.gp

     To	plot a histogram of N(h), simply edit name.gp and redo
     the previously given command.

     Data Analysis and Semivariogram Modeling.

BUGS
     Will not work correctly with lat-long data. Should
     G_azimuth() be used to calculate the angle	between	points?

     Only Matheron's classical estimator is available with s.sv.
     Others may	be added in the	future.

     Please send all bug fixes and comments to the author.

NOTICE
     This program is part of the alpha section of the GRASS
     distribution.  Unlike the code in the main	section	of GRASS,
     the alpha code has	not yet	been fully tested for one release
     cycle.
