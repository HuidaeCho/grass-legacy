     i.in.erdas help
     i.in.erdas [-l] input=name output=name [trailer=name]

DESCRIPTION
     This program creates raster map files from ERDAS files.  It
     creates one raster file for each selected band, up to a
     maximum of seven bands.  GRASS color and category support
     files are created if an ERDAS trailer file is specified.

     Only ERDAS version 7.4 or later files in 4-bit, 8-bit, or
     16-bit formats are supported.
     GRASS raster files will be named prefix.band

     Note:
	  Remember that it is necessary to run: r.support to
	  create the histogram or change the color table.
	  i.group to associate the individual raster files as an
	  image group.
