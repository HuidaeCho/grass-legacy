NAME
     i.quantize - An interactive imagery function that creates a
     raster map layer whose color table is based on the red,
     green, and blue color values present in existing, user-
     specified imagery group files.
     (GRASS Image Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     i.quantize

DESCRIPTION
     i.quantize is an interactive imagery function that allows
     the user to create a new raster map layer whose color table
     values are based on the red, green, and blue color values
     present in (as many as) three raster map layers in an
     imagery group.

     The user is first asked to enter the name of the imagery
     group from whose map layers red, green, and blue color
     values are to be extracted.  The user is then shown a
     listing of imagery files in the specified group, and is
     asked to indicate which files in the group are to be used
     for red, green, and blue colors in the new map layer.  Each
     color (red, green, and blue) must be specified once and only
     once.

     The user is also asked to assign a name to the new raster
     map layer output.

NOTES
     This program is interactive and requires no command line
     arguments.
     The input files must ALL be within the range of 0-255.
