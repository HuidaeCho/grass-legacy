NAME
     r.ros (for wildfire spread simulation) - Generates three, or
     four raster map layers showing 1) the base (perpendicular)
     rate of spread (ROS), 2) the maximum (forward) ROS, 3) the
     direction of the maximum ROS, and optionally 4) the maximum
     potential spotting distance.  (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.ros
     r.ros help
     r.ros [-vs] model=name [moisture_1h=name]
     [moisture_10h=name] [moisture_100h=name] moisture_live=name
     [velocity=name] [direction=name] [slope=name] [aspect=name]
     [elevation=name] output=name

DESCRIPTION
     r.ros generates the base ROS value, maximum ROS value,
     direction of the maximum ROS, and optionally the maximum
     potential spotting distance of a wildfire for each raster
     cell in the current geographic region.

     The calculation of the two ROS values for each raster cell
     is based on the Fortran code by Pat Andrews (1983) of the
     Northern Forest Fire Laboratory, USDA Forest Service.

     The direction of the maximum ROS results from the vector
     addition of the forward ROS in wind direction and that in
     upslope direction.

     The spotting distance, if required, will be calculated by a
     separate function, spot_dist(), which is based on Lathrop
     and Xu (in preparation), Chase (1984) and Rothermel (1991).

     These three or four raster map layers serve as inputs for
     another GRASS raster program r.spread. More information on
     r.ros and r.spread can be found in Xu (1994).

     Flags:

     -v		       Run verbosely, printing information about
		       program progress to standard output.

     -s		       Calculate the maximum potential spotting
		       distance.

     Parameters:

     model=name	       Name of an existing raster map layer in
		       the user's current mapset search path
		       containing the standard fuel models
		       defined by the USDA Forest Service. Valid
		       values are 1-13; other numbers are

r.ros <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	    <alpha> r.ros



     output=name       Prefix of new raster map layers in the
		       user's current mapset to contain 1) the
		       base (perpendicular) ROS (cm/minute); 2)
		       the maximum (forward) ROS (cm/minute), 3)
		       the direction of the maximum ROS,
		       clockwise from north (degree), and
		       optionally 4) the maximum potential
		       spotting distance (meters).

		       If 'my_ros' is given as the output name,
		       then r.ros automatically assigns
		       'my_ros.base', 'my_ros.max',
		       'my_ros.maxdir', and optionally,
		       'my_ros.spotdist' as the names for the
		       actual output map layers.

OPTIONS
     r.ros can be run either non-interactively or interactively.
     The program is run interactively if the user types r.ros
     without specifying flag settings and parameter values on the
     command line.  In this case, the user will be prompted for
     input.

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies the names of raster map layers and any desired
     options on the command line, using the form:

	  r.ros [-vs] model=name [moisture_1h=name]
	  [moisture_10h=name] [moisture_100h=name]
	  moisture_live=name [velocity=name] [direction=name]
	  [slope=name] [aspect=name] [elevation=name] output=name

     If the options moisture_1h=name, moisture_10h=name, and
     moisture_100h=name are partially given, the program will
     assign values to the missing option using the formula:
	  moisture_100h = moisture_10h + 1 = moisture_1h + 2.
     However at least one of them should be given.

     Options velocity=name and direction=name must be in pair,
     whether given or not. If none is given, the program will
     assume a no-wind condition.

     Options slope=name and aspect=name must be in pair, whether
     given or not. If none is given, the program will assume a
     topographically flat condition.

     Option elevation=name must be given if -s option is used.

EXAMPLE
     Assume we have inputs, the following generates ROSes and
     spotting distances:

r.ros <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	    <alpha> r.ros



	  r.ros -vs model=fire_model moisture_1h=1hour_moisture
	  moisture_live=live_moisture velocity=wind_speed
	  direction=wind_direction slope=slope aspect=aspect
	  elevation=elevation output=my_ros

NOTES
     1. r.ros is supposed to be run before running another GRASS
     program r.spread. The combination of the two forms a
     simulation of the spread of wildfires.

     2. The inputs to r.ros should be in proper units.

     3. The output units for the base and maximum ROSes are in
     cm/minute rather than ft/minute, which is due to that a
     possible zero ft/minute base ROS value and a positive
     integer ft/minute maximum ROS would result in calculation
     failure in the r.spread program.

     4. The user needs to provide only ONE output name even the
     program actually generates THREE or FOUR map layers.

     5. The rules for optional parameters must be followed.
