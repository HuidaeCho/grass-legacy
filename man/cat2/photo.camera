     This is not a command in itself, but an option to the
     command i.ortho.photo.



NAME
     photo.camera - An imagery function that creates or modifies
     entries in a camera reference file.
     (GRASS Image Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     photo.camera option must be selected from GRASS Image
     Processing Program i.ortho.photo.

DESCRIPTION
     photo.camera creates or modifies entries in a camera
     reference file.  For ortho-photo rectification, a camera
     reference file is required for computation of scanned image
     to photo-coordinate transformation parameters.

     The first prompt in the program will ask you for the name of
     the camera reference file to be created or modified.  You
     may create a new camera reference file by entering a new
     name, or modify an existing camera reference file by
     entering the name of an existing camera file.

     After entering the camera file name, following menu is
     displayed:

               Please provide the following information

          CAMERA NAME:               camera name______
          CAMERA IDENTIFICATION:     identification___
          CALIBRATED FOCAL LENGTH mm.:_________________
          POINT OF SYMMETRY (X)   mm.:_________________
          POINT OF SYMMETRY (Y)   mm.:_________________
          MAXIMUM NUMBER OF FIDUCIALS:_________________

     The camera name and identification describe the camera
     reference file.  The calibrated focal length and the point
     of symmetry are used in computing the photo-to-target
     transformation parameters.  These values should be entered
     from the camera calibration report (usually available from
     the photograph supplier).  The maximum number of fiducials
     will determine the number of fiducial or reasuae coordinate
     pairs to be entered below.

     You are then ask to enter the X and Y photo coordinates of

                       (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

     The input display is repeated until the number of MAXIMUM
     FIDUCIALS is reached.  On this screen you should enter the
     fiducial or ressuae photo-coordinates as given in the camera
     calibration report.  The X, and Y coordinates are in milli-
     meters from the principle point.
