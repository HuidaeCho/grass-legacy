NAME
     v.alabel - Bulk-labels unlabeled area features in a binary
     GRASS vector file.
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.alabel
     v.alabel help
     v.alabel [-i] map=name [value=value]

DESCRIPTION
     v.alabel allows the user to bulk-label (area features) in a
     binary GRASS vector file (i.e., a dig file).  The user must
     run v.support on the vector file before running v.alabel if
     any modifications have been made to the file since the last
     time v.support was run on it, to ensure that all area
     features are properly identified in the file topology.

     The user must also run v.support on the vector file after
     v.alabel is run for labeling changes to be made evident.

     v.support builds GRASS support files for (binary) GRASS
     vector data files.	 These support files supply topology
     (dig_plus) and category (dig_att) information that are
     needed by other GRASS programs (e.g., by v.digit, v.to.rast,
     etc.).

OPTIONS
     Program parameters and flags have the following meanings.

     Flag:

     -i		       Label areas incrementally.  For each
		       unique, unlabeled polygon in the vector
		       file, increment the category value by one,
		       starting from the initial user-assigned
		       value.


     Parameters:

     map=name	       Name of binary GRASS vector data file
		       whose unlabeled areas are to be labelled.
		       This map layer must exist in the user's
		       current GRASS mapset.

     value=value       The category value to be assigned to all
		       unlabeled areas in the vector map layer.
		       If the -i flag is set, v.alabel will
		       increment the initial value by one for
		       each unique unlabeled polygon in the
		       vector map.

		       Default:	 1

     The user can run this program non-interactively by
     specifying parameter values (and optionally, the flag
     setting) on the command line.

     Alternately, the user can simply type the command v.alabel
     on the command line.  In this event, the program will prompt
     the user to enter parameter values and flag settings.

NOTES
     A dig_plus file must be created for each imported vector map
     before it can be used in post-GRASS 3.0 versions of digit
     (now referred to as v.digit).

     Topological information for GRASS vector files can also be
     built using option 4 of the v.import program.

     The user can bulk-label unlabeled line features in a binary
     vector file using v.digit.
