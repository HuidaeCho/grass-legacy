NAME
     m.in.stf1.db3 - Import Demographic records from Census STF1A
     dBase3 (CDROM) Files
     (GRASS Sites Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.in.stf1.db3 help
     m.in.stf1.db3 [-f] [-p] [-n] sc=string [ sc=str . . ]
     in=/cdrom/stf1a0ss.dbf > result_file
     This command may be run in command line mode only.
     Parameters used must be in the order specified.


PARAMETERS
	   -f	    Output to stdout the list of all field name and starting positions
		    for the Identification Section of the STF1A file.  Other
		    parameters are not necessary and will be ignored.

	   -p	    Print several information items to stderr as the 10 input
		    files are opened.

	   -n	    Output only the sequential number and STF1A logical record
		    number (LOGRECNU) of matching records to stdout.

	   sc=string	 sc is starting column or a capitilized reference name from
		    the Identification Section of the STF1A Data Dictionary;
		    string is characters to match there.  A negative test may
		    also be made with: sc!=string.  If more than one test is
		    specified the results are "anded" resulting in a
		    conjunction of the results of the expressions.  (See
		    m.in.stf1.tpe for complete details.)

	   in	    Path/file for dBase files for state ss.

DESCRIPTION
     This program is provided to read and assemble the Census
     STF1A data records from a set of 10 files for one state.
     The files are usually on a CD-ROM, but this is not necessary
     providing the proper path is given for the in= parameter and
     all 10 files are in the same directory with their normal
     names.

     The output consists of data from the 10 input files
     assembled into records identical to the STF1A tape
     distribution format.  The output records are each about 4800
     characters and a pair constitute a logical STF1A record.

     Users of GRASS 4.1 and the Census STF1A files on CD-ROM will
     generally use this program to select appropriate subsets of
     STF1A records; write them to one or more files (in the STF1A
     tape format); and then either process these files directly
     with v.apply.census to print demographics, create site maps

     or label vector maps, or use m.in.stf1.tpe to extract
     further subsets.

     The STF1A CD-ROM data sets for most states are very large,
     100+ MB.  This program may take 20 to 60 minutes for a
     single extraction, so plan carefully and don't discard
     useful subsets that you create on disk.


EXAMPLES
     Insert the appropriate CD-ROM and mount it (see your system
     administrator).  (We assume here that it is mounted as the
     file system /cdrom.)

     To extract all Census tract summary records for the state of
     South Dakota:

     m.in.stf1.db3 -p 11=140 in=/cdrom/stf1a0sd.dbf > tracts.SD

     The 11=140 parameter selects those records which have the
     character string Summary Level (SUMLEV) field which is used
     in almost every selection from CD-ROM.

     To extract all block group records for Lawrence County,
     South Dakota:

     m.in.stf1.db3 -p SUMLEV=150 CNTY=081 in=/cdrom/stf1a0sd.dbf
     >

     150 is the SUMLEV for block groups and 081 is the county
     code for Lawrence Co.


SEE ALSO
     m.in.stf1.tpe is used as a post-processor to select further
     subsets of STF1A records.	NOTE: Unix utility programs, such
     as grep or awk, cannot be used for the for processing the
     STF1 files due to their very long record lengths.

     This program is part of the alpha section of the GRASS
     distribution.  Unlike the code in the main section of GRASS,
     the alpha code has not yet been fully tested for one release
     cycle.
