NAME
     i.cluster - An imagery function that generates spectral
     signatures for land cover types in an image using a
     clustering algorithm.  The resulting signature file is used
     as input for i.maxlik, to generate an unsupervised image
     classification.
     (GRASS Image Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     i.cluster
     i.cluster help
     i.cluster [-q] group=name subgroup=name sigfile=name
     classes=value [seed=name] [sample=row_interval,col_interval]
     [iterations=value] [convergence=value] [separation=value]
     [min_size=value] [reportfile=name]

DESCRIPTION
     i.cluster performs the first pass in the GRASS two-pass
     unsupervised classification of imagery, while the GRASS
     program i.maxlik executes the second pass. Both programs
     must be run to complete the unsupervised classification.

     i.cluster is a clustering algorithm that reads through the
     (raster) imagery data and builds pixel clusters based on the
     spectral reflectances of the pixels.  The pixel clusters are
     imagery categories that can be related to land cover types
     on the ground.  The spectral distributions of the clusters
     (which will be the land cover spectral signatures) are
     influenced by six parameters set by the user.  The first
     parameter set by the user is the initial number of clusters
     to be discriminated.  i.cluster starts by generating
     spectral signatures for this number of clusters and
     "attempts" to end up with this number of clusters during the
     clustering process.  The resulting number of clusters and
     their spectral distributions, however, are also influenced
     by the range of the spectral values (category values) in the
     image files and the other parameters set by the user.  These
     parameters are: the minimum cluster size, minimum cluster
     separation, the percent convergence, the maximum number of
     iterations, and the row and column sampling intervals.

     The cluster spectral signatures that result are composed of
     cluster means and covariance matrices.  These cluster means
     and covariance matrices are used in the second pass
     (i.maxlik) to classify the image.	The clusters or spectral
     classes result can be related to land cover types on the
     ground.

OPTIONS
     The program can be run either non-interactively or
     interactively. It will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies the name of group file, the name of subgroup file,

i.cluster <alpha>     GRASS Reference Manual	<alpha> i.cluster



     the name of a file to contain result signatures, the initial
     number of clusters to be discriminated, and optionally other
     parameters (see below) on the command line using the form:

	  i.cluster [-q] group=name subgroup=name sigfile=name
	  classes=value [seed=name]
	  [sample=row_interval,col_interval] [iterations=value]
	  [convergence=value] [separation=value] [min_size=value]
	  [reportfile=name]

     where the group should contain the imagery files that the
     user wishes to classify.  The subgroup is a subset of this
     group.  The user must create a group and subgroup by running
     the GRASS program i.group before running i.cluster.  The
     subgroup should contain only the imagery band files that the
     user wishes to classify.  Note that this subgroup must
     contain more than one band file.  The purpose of the group
     and subgroup is to collect map layers for classification or
     analysis. The sigfile is the file to contain result
     signatures which can be used as input for i.maxlik. The
     classes value is the initial number of clusters to be
     discriminated; any parameter values left unspecified are set
     to their default values. Alternatively, the program will be
     run interactively if the user types only i.cluster; in this
     case the program will prompt the user for parameter values
     using the standard GRASS parser interface described in the
     manual entry for parser.

     Flags:

     -q		       Run quietly.  Suppresses output of program
		       percent-complete messages and the time
		       elapsed from the beginning of the program.
		       If this flag is not used, these messages
		       are printed out.


     Parameters:

     group=name	       The name of the group file which contains
		       the imagery files that the user wishes to
		       classify.

     subgroup=name     The name of the subset of the group
		       specified in group option, which must
		       contain only imagery band files and more
		       than one band file. The user must create a
		       group and a subgroup by running the GRASS
		       program i.group before running i.cluster.

     sigfile=name      The name assigned to output signature file
		       which contains signatures of classes and

		       can be used as the input file for the
		       GRASS program i.maxlik for an unsupervised
		       classification.

     classes=value     The number of clusters that will initially
		       be identified in the clustering process
		       before the iterations begin.

     seed=name	       The name of a seed signature file is
		       optional. The seed signatures are
		       signatures that contain cluster means and
		       covariance matrices which were calculated
		       prior to the current run of i.cluster.
		       They may be acquired from a previously run
		       of i.cluster or from a supervised
		       classification signature training site
		       section (e.g., using the signature file
		       output by i.class). The purpose of seed
		       signatures is to optimize the cluster
		       decision boundaries (means) for the number
		       of clusters specified.

     sample=row_interval,col_interval
		       These numbers are optional with default
		       values based on the size of the data set
		       such that the total pixels to be processed
		       is approximately 10,000 (consider round
		       up).

     iterations=value  This parameter determines the maximum
		       number of iterations which is greater than
		       the number of iterations predicted to
		       achieve the optimum percent convergence.
		       The default value is 30. If the number of
		       iterations reaches the maximum designated
		       by the user; the user may want to rerun
		       i.cluster with a higher number of
		       iterations (see reportfile).
		       Default: 30

     convergence=value A high percent convergence is the point at
		       which cluster means become stable during
		       the iteration process. The default value
		       is 98.0 percent.	 When clusters are being
		       created, their means constantly change as
		       pixels are assigned to them and the means
		       are recalculated to include the new pixel.
		       After all clusters have been created,
		       i.cluster begins iterations that change
		       cluster means by maximizing the distances
		       between them.  As these means shift, a
		       higher and higher convergence is

		       approached.  Because means will never
		       become totally static, a percent
		       convergence and a maximum number of
		       iterations are supplied to stop the
		       iterative process.  The percent
		       convergence should be reached before the
		       maximum number of iterations. If the
		       maximum number of iterations is reached,
		       it is probable that the desired percent
		       convergence was not reached. The number of
		       iterations is reported in the cluster
		       statistics in the report file (see
		       reportfile).
		       Default: 98.0

     separation=value  This is the minimum separation below which
		       clusters will be merged in the iteration
		       process. The default value is 0.0. This is
		       an image-specific number (a "magic"
		       number) that depends on the image data
		       being classified and the number of final
		       clusters that are acceptable. Its
		       determination requires experimentation.
		       Note that as the minimum class (or
		       cluster) separation is increased, the
		       maximum number of iterations should also
		       be increased to achieve this separation
		       with a high percentage of convergence (see
		       convergence).
		       Default: 0.0

     min_size=value    This is the minimum number of pixels that
		       will be used to define a cluster, and is
		       therefore the minimum number of pixels for
		       which means and covariance matrices will
		       be calculated.
		       Default: 17

     reportfile=name   The reportfile is an optional parameter
		       which contains the result, i.e., the
		       statistics for each cluster. Also included
		       are the resulting percent convergence for
		       the clusters, the number of iterations
		       that was required to achieve the
		       convergence, and the separability matrix.


NOTES
     Running in command line mode, i.cluster will overwrite the
     output signature file and reportfile (if required by the
     user) without prompting if the files existed.
