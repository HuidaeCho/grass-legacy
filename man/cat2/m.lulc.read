m.lulc.read <alpha>   GRASS Reference Manual  <alpha> m.lulc.read



NAME
     m.lulc.read - Extracts Landuse/Landcover data in the ASCII
     Composite Theme Grid (CTG) data format distributed by the
     USGS in to a working file for m.lulc.USGS.
     (GRASS Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     dd [if=tapedev] ibs=input block_size cbs=80 conv=unblock |
     m.lulc.read arg1

DESCRIPTION
     m.lulc.read extracts USGS Land Use/Land Cover data
     distributed in the ASCII CTG format.  Extracted data is
     placed into a file specified by arg1.  m.lulc.read should be
     used prior to using the GRASS program m.lulc.USGS.

     m.lulc.read reads the data from standard input, allowing the
     user to pipe in the data from a file.

     Data can also be read directly from the 1/2-inch magnetic
     tape distributed by USGS, by using the UNIX command dd.

     Parameters:

     if=tapedev
	  The pathname of the input tape drive (usually
	  /dev/rmt0).

     ibs=input
	  The physical blocking value of the data on tape,
	  usually written on the tape spool.  If this value is
	  unknown, run m.examine.tape prior to m.lulc.read.

     cbs  This is the conversion blocking factor for ASCII CTG
	  file and is by default set to 80.

     conv Set conv to unblock when extracting ASCII CTG data.

     arg1 The name of the output file where the data will be
	  stored in binary format.

EXAMPLES
     READING FROM A FILE:

	  m.lulc.read outfile < infile

     The above command will read the data from infile and place
     the results into outfile.	Note that infile must be
     extracted from the USGS CTG 1/2 magnetic tape using the UNIX
     dd command:

	  dd if=/dev/rmt0 of=infile ibs=32000 cbs=80 conv=unblock

     READING DIRECTLY FROM 1/2 INCH MAGNETIC TAPE:

	  dd if=/dev/rmt0 ibs=32000 cbs=80 conv=unblock |
	  m.lulc.read outfile

     The above command will extract data with a blocksize of
     32000 from /dev/rmt0, and put the results in the file
     outfile.
