NAME
     m.dem.extract - Extracts USGS Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
     data from 1/2-inch magnetic tape.
     (GRASS Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.dem.extract
     m.dem.extract help
     m.dem.extract input=name output=name blocksize=value
     start=value end=value

DESCRIPTION
     m.dem.extract extracts USGS Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
     elevation data that fits into the user's current geographic
     region from the input file input, in blocks of blocksize
     bytes.  If no input file is specified by the user, input is
     taken from /dev/rmt0, by default.	Results are placed in the
     named output file, and stored beneath the cell directory of
     the user's current mapset.	 m.dem.extract will only extract
     data that fall within the boundaries of the user's current
     geographic region.	 Data falling outside this region will be
     ignored.  m.dem.extract will not complain if the input file
     does not cover the entire geographic region.  The user
     should run m.dem.extract without specifying output file
     (which only examines the input file) prior to extracting the
     data to determine the size of the geographic region needed.
     If the block size is unknown, run the command
     m.examine.tape.

     The user can run this program either non-interactively or
     interactively.  The program will be run non-interactively if
     the user specifies program arguments on the command line,
     using the form:

	  m.dem.extract input=name [output=name]
	  [blocksize=value] [start=value] [end=value]

     Alternately, the user can simply type m.dem.extract on the
     command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for needed parameter values using the
     standard GRASS interface described in the manual entry for
     parser.

     Parameters:

     input=name	       The full path name of tape device or file
		       from which DEM data are to be extracted.
		       Default:	 /dev/rmt0

     output=name       The name to be assigned to the output file
		       containing raster DEM data extracted from
		       1/2-inch tape.

     blocksize=value   The physical block size (record length) of
		       each each record, in bytes.
		       m.examine.tape can be used to determine
		       block size.

     start=value       First DEM quad to look at (default 1).

     end=value	       Last DEM quad to look at (default
		       9999999).

NOTES
     The user should check the boundaries and resolution of the
     current region setting (see g.region) BEFORE extracting
     data, since m.dem.extract will only extract the data that
     falls within these boundaries and only use the set
     resolution during extraction.

     Warning:  This program assumes that the tape has ONLY DEM
     data.  If the tape contains other files (DLG, for example)
     the program will not skip over them.  In this case, forward
     the tape to the first DEM file.  Use the appropriate UNIX
     commands (mt to forward the tapes past the non-DEM files,
     and dd to extract and copy the correct files) on the tape on
     another machine first to extract the non-DEM data from the
     tape.

     USGS Tapes:  This version of m.dem.extract is sensitive to
     formatting errors.	 If the format on a tape is wrong, the
     program exits with the error message: "The file with
     incorrect data format encountered ..."   Nevertheless, the
     program continues.	 In this case, run the program without
     specifying input files.  If the program exits again with the
     same error message, there is an inconsistency in the data
     format.

     The format error:	Each USGS Dem file consists of A and B,
     and sometimes C, records--
	  type A record	 header
	  type B record	 collection of profiles with various
     numbers of elevations
	  type C record	 accuracy

     This new version of m.dem.extract cannot skip over any
     records to the end of a DEM file. It first determines how
     many records there are in a file, reads those records, and
     then proceeds to the header (record A) of the next file.
     Thus it is very important for the program to know whether or
     not there is a C record to be read at the end of each file.
     This information is given in the  file's header record (type
     A) which has a field set to 1 when a C-record exits, and to
     0 when a C-record does not exist.

     In some DEM files, the accuracy field is set to 0, even
     though a C-record does exist.  Because of this error, when
     the program tries to read the data, it will not try to read
     the C-record, but instead attempts to go on to the next file
     and read its header--a type A record.  This results in the
     format error because type A records and type C records have
     different formats, and the program is trying to read a type
     A record  when  the tape is presenting a type C record.

     When this format error in a file is encountered, forward the
     tape to the next file.
