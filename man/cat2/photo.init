photo.init <alpha>    GRASS Reference Manual   <alpha> photo.init



     This is not a command itself, but an option of the command
     i.ortho.photo.



NAME
     photo.init - An imagery function that creates or modifies
     the optional entries in a camera initial exposure station
     file for an imagery group.
     (GRASS Image Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     Selected from i.ortho.photo

DESCRIPTION
     photo.init creates or modifies entries in a camera initial
     exposure station file for imagery group referenced by a sub-
     block.  These entries include: the (XC,YC,ZC) UTM
     approximate coordinates of the camera exposure station;
     initial roll, pitch, and yaw angles (in degrees) of the
     cameras attitude; and the a priori standard deviations for
     these parameters.	During the imagery program,
     photo.rectify, the initial camera exposure station file is
     used for computation of the ortho-rectification parameters.
     If no initial camera exposure station file exist, the
     default values are computed from the control points file
     created in photo.2target.

     The following menu is displayed:

     The INITIAL values for (XC,YC,ZC) are expressed in UTM
     coordinates, and represent an approximation for the location

     of the camera at the time of exposure.

     The INITIAL values for (omega,phi,kappa) are expressed in
     degrees, and represent an approximation for the cameras
     attitude  at the time of exposure.

     The standard deviations for (XC,YC,ZC) are expressed in
     meters, and are used as a priori values for the standard
     deviations used in computation of the ortho rectification
     parameters.

     The standard deviations for (omega,phi,kappa) are expressed
