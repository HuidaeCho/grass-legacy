NAME
     ps.map - Hardcopy PostScript map output utility.
     (GRASS Hardcopy PostScript Output Program)

SYNOPSIS
     ps.map
     ps.map help
     ps.map [r] [input=name] [scale=mapscale] [copies=n]
     output=name

DESCRIPTION
     ps.map produces an output file containing a PostScript
     program to produce hardcopy map products on your system's
     PostScript output device.	Output can include a raster map,
     any number of vector overlays, site data, text labels, and
     other spatial data.

     This program has 2 distincts modes of operation.  The
     command-line mode requires the user to prepare a file of
     mapping instructions describing the various spatial and
     textual information to be printed prior to running ps.map.
     The interactive mode (i.e., no command-line arguments) will
     prompt the user for items to be mapped and does not require
     the user to prepare a file of instructions.

     The command line flag is:

     r		       Rotate plot 90 degrees.


     The command-line parameters are:

     input=name	       File containing mapping instructions.  (or
		       enter input=- to enter from keyboard).
		       These instructions are described in detail
		       below.

     scale=mapscale    Scale of the output map,	 e.g. 1:25000
		       Default:	 1 panel

		       This parameter is provided as a
		       convenience.  It is identical to the scale
		       mapping instruction described below.

     output=name       Name of output the file to contain the
		       PostScript program.


     Note: the user must select a PostScript output device using
     ps.select before running ps.map.

MAPPING INSTRUCTIONS
     The mapping instructions allow the user to specify various
     spatial data to be plotted. These instructions are normally
     prepared in a regular text file using a system editor.  Some
     instructions are single line instructions while others are
     multiple line. Multiple line instructions consist of the
     main instruction followed by a subsection of one or more
     additional instructions.

     Instructions that may be included in the subsection under
     several different main instructions are:

     where x y	       The top left corner of the bounding box of
		       the item to be plotted is located x inches
		       from the left edge of the paper and y
		       inches from the top edge of the paper. If
		       x is less than or equal to zero, the
		       default horizontal location is used.  If y
		       is less than or equal to zero, the default
		       vertical location is used.

     font font name    The name of the PostScript font.	 The
		       default is Helvetica.

     fontsize font size
		       The size of the PostScript font in 1/72
		       inch.  The default is 10.


colortable
     Prints the color table for the raster map layer anywhere on
     the page.

     USAGE:   colortable [y|n]
		where x y
		width table width
		cols table columns
		font font name
		fontsize font size
		color text color
		end

     The color table will display the colors for each raster map
     layer category value and the category label.  To get a color
     table, you must have previously requested a raster map
     layer.  The default location for the colortable is
     immediately below any other map legend information, starting
     at the left margin.  The default text color is black.
     Omitting the colortable instruction would result in no color
     table.  Note:  Be careful about asking for color tables for
     raster map layers which have many categories, such as
     elevation.	 This could result in the printing of an



2		      GRASS Development Team	   GRASS 5.0beta2






ps.map <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     extremely long color table!!!!!

     This example would print a color table immediately below any
     other map legend information, starting at the left margin.
     EXAMPLE:	colortable y



comments
     Prints comments anywhere on the page.

     USAGE:   comments commentfile
		where x y
		font font name
		fontsize font size
		color text color
		end

     The default location is immediately below the last item item
     printed, starting at the left margin.  The default text
     color is black.

     This example prints in blue whatever is in the file
     veg.comments starting at 1.5 inches from the left edge of
     the page and 7.25 inches from the top of the page, using a
     15/72 inch Helvetica Bold font.
     EXAMPLE:	raster vegetation
		comments veg.comments
		  where 1.5 7.25
		  font Helvetica Bold
		  fontsize 15
		  color blue
		  end

     Presumably, the file veg.comments contain comments
     pertaining to the raster map layer vegetation, such as "This
     map was created by classifying a LANDSAT TM image".



copies
     Specifies the number of copies to be printed.

     USAGE:   copies n

     Each page will be printed n times.



greyrast
     Selects a raster map layer for output in shades of grey.




GRASS 5.0beta2	      GRASS Development Team			3






ps.map <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     USAGE:   greyrast mapname|list

     For each ps.map run, only one raster map layer can be
     requested (using either the greyrast or the raster
     instruction).



grid
     Overlays a coordinate grid onto the output map.

     USAGE:   grid spacing
		color color
		numbers # [color]
		font font name
		fontsize font size
		end

     The spacing of the grid is given (in the geographic
     coordinate system units) on the main instruction line.  The
     subsection instructions allow the user to specify the color
     of the grid lines, whether coordinate numbers should appear
     on the grid lines, and if they should appear every grid line
     (1), every other grid line (2), etc., and what color the
     numbers should be.	 The defaults are black grid lines,
     unnumbered.

     This example would overlay a green grid with a spacing of
     10000 meters (for a metered database, like UTM) onto the
     output map.  Alternate grid lines would be numbered with red
     numbers.

     EXAMPLE:	grid 10000
		  color green
		  numbers 2 red
		  end



header
     Prints the map header above the map.

     USAGE:   header
		file header file
		font font name
		fontsize font size
		color text color
		end

     If the header instruction or the file sub-instruction is
     absent, the header will consist of the map title and
     location, each centered on the page above the map.	 The



4		      GRASS Development Team	   GRASS 5.0beta2






ps.map <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     default text color is black.

     This example prints (in red) whatever is in the file
     soils.hdr above the map, using a 20/72 inch Courier font.
     EXAMPLE:	header
		  file soils.hdr
		  font Courier
		  fontsize 20
		  color red
		  end




labels
     Selects a labels file for output (see manual entry for
     p.labels).

     USAGE:   labels  labelfile|list
		font font name
		end

     This example would paint labels from the labels file called
     town.names.  Presumably, these labels would indicate the
     names of towns on the map.

     EXAMPLE:	labels town.names



line
     Draws lines on the output map.

     USAGE:   line east north east north
	      line x% y% x% y%
		color color
		width #
		masked [y|n]
		end

     The beginning and ending points of the line are entered on
     the main instruction.  These points can be defined either by
     map coordinates or by using percentages of the geographic
     region.  The user may also specify line color, width in
     pixels (accepts decimal points [floating points] as well as
     integers), and if the line is to be masked by the current
     mask. (See manual entry for r.mask for more information on
     the mask.)

     This example would draw a yellow line from the point x=10%
     y=80% to the point x=30% y=70%. This line would be 2 pixels
     wide and would appear even if there is a mask.



GRASS 5.0beta2	      GRASS Development Team			5






ps.map <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     EXAMPLE:	line 10% 80% 30% 70%
		  color yellow
		  width 2
		  masked n
		  end

     Of course, multiple lines may be drawn with multiple line
     instructions.



mapinfo
     Prints the portion of the map legend containing the scale,
     grid and region information, on or below the map.

     USAGE:   mapinfo
		where x y
		font font name
		fontsize font size
		color text color
		end

     The default location is immediately below the map, starting
     at the left edge of the map.  The default text color is
     black.

     This example prints (in brown) the scale, grid and region
     information immediately below the map and starting 1.5
     inches from the left edge of the page, using a 12/72 inch
     Courier font.
     EXAMPLE:	mapinfo
		  where 1.5 0
		  font Courier
		  fontsize 12
		  color brown
		  end



maploc
     Positions the map on the page.

     USAGE:   maploc  x y [width height]

     The upper left corner of the map will be positioned x inches
     from the left edge of the page and y inches from the top of
     the page.	If width and height (in inches) are present, the
     map will be rescaled, if necessary, to fit.

     This example positions the upper left corner of the map 2.0
     inches from the left edge and 3.5 inches from the top edge
     of the map.

ps.map <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     EXAMPLE:	maploc 2.0 3.5



outline
     Outlines the areas of a raster map layer with a specified
     color.

     USAGE:   outline
		color  color
		width  width of line in pixels
		end


     Distinct areas of the raster map will be separated from each
     other visually by drawing a border (or outline) in the
     specified color (default: black). For width the program
     accepts decimal points [floating points] as well as
     integers.	Note: it is important the user enter the
     instruction end even if a color is not chosen.  (It is hoped
     that in the future the outline of a different raster map
     layer other than the one currently being painted may be
     placed on the map.)

     This example would outline the category areas of the soils
     raster map layer in grey.
     EXAMPLE:	raster soils
		outline
		color grey
		width 2
		end


point
     Places additional points or icons on the output map.

     USAGE:   point east north
	      point x% y%
		color color
		icon iconfile|list
		size #
		masked [y|n]
		end

     The point location is entered in the main instruction line
     by giving either the map coordinates or by using percentages
     of the geographic region.	The user may also specify the
     point color, the icon file to be used to represent the point
     location (see the the manual entry for ps.icons), the size
     of the icon as a multiple of the size of the pattern in the
     icon file (default is 1.0, aprroximately equivalent to a 10
     point character), and whether the point is to be masked by



GRASS 5.0beta2	      GRASS Development Team			7






ps.map <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     the current mask. (See manual entry for r.mask for more
     information on the mask.)

     This example would place a purple diamond (from icon file
     diamond) at the point (E456000 N7890000).	This diamond
     would be the approximately the size of a 15 point character
     and would not be masked by the current mask.

     EXAMPLE:	point 456000 7890000
		  color purple
		  icon diamond
		  size 1.5
		  masked n
		  end


     Of course, multiple points may be drawn with multiple point
     instructions.


psfile
     Copies a file containing PostScript commands into the output
     file.

     Note: ps.map will not search for this file.  The user must
     be in the correct directory or specify the full path on the
     psfile instruction.  (Note to /bin/csh users: ~ won't work
     with this instruction).

     USAGE:   psfile filename

     This example copies the file "logo.ps" into the output file.

     EXAMPLE:	psfile logo.ps


raster
     Selects a raster map layer for output.

     USAGE:   raster mapname|list

     For each ps.map run, only one raster map layer can be
     requested.	 If no raster map layer is requested, a
     completely white map will be produced.  It can be useful to
     select no raster map layer in order to provide a white
     background for vector images.

     This example would paint a map of the raster map layer
     soils.
     EXAMPLE:	raster soils

ps.map <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



read
     Provides ps.map with a previously prepared input stream.

     USAGE:   read previously prepared UNIX file

     Mapping instructions can be placed into a file and read into
     ps.map.

     Note: ps.map will not search for this file.  The user must
     be in the correct directory or specify the full path on the
     read instruction.	(Note to /bin/csh users: ~ won't work
     with this instruction).

     This example reads the UNIX file pmap.roads into ps.map.
     This file may contain all the ps.map instructions for
     placing the vector map layer roads onto the output map.

     EXAMPLE: read pmap.roads

     The user may have created this file because this vector map
     layer is particularly useful for many ps.map outputs.  By
     using the read option, the user need not enter all the input
     for the vector instruction, but simply read the previously
     prepared file with the correct instructions.


region
     Places the outline of a smaller geographic region on the
     output.

     USAGE:   region regionfile|list
		color color
		width #
		end

     Geographic region settings are created and saved using
     g.region.	The ps.map region option can be used to show an
     outline of a smaller region which was printed on a separate
     run of ps.map on other user-created maps.

     The user can specify the color and the width in pixel units
     (accepts decimal points [floating points] as well as
     integers) of the outline.	The default is a black border of
     one pixel width.

     This example would place a white outline, 2 pixels wide, of
     the geographic region called fire.zones onto the output map.
     This geographic region would have been created and saved
     using g.region.

     EXAMPLE:	region fire.zones

ps.map <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



		  color white
		  width 2
		  end


scale
     Selects a scale for the output map.

     USAGE:   scale scale

     The scale can be selected either as:

	  a relative ratio, e.g. 1:25000;

	  an absolute width of the printed map, e.g. 10 inches;

	  the number of printed paper panels, e.g. 3 panels (at
	  the present time, only 1 panel is supported);

	  the number of miles per inch, e.g. 1 inch equals 4
	  miles.

     This example would set the scale of the map to 1 unit =
     25000 units.
     EXAMPLE:	scale 1:25000


setcolor
     Overrides the color assigned to one or more categories of
     the raster map layer.

     USAGE:   setcolor cat(s) color


     This example would set the color for categories 2,5 and 8 of
     the raster map layer watersheds to white and category 10 to
     green.  (NOTE: no spaces are inserted between the category
     values.)

     EXAMPLE:	raster watersheds
		setcolor 2,5,8 white
		setcolor 10 green

     Of course, setcolor can be requested more than once to
     override the default color for additional categories.  More
     than one category can be changed for each request by listing
     all the category values separated by commas (but with no
     spaces).

ps.map <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



sites
     Selects sites data to be placed on the output map (see
     manual entry for s.menu).

     USAGE:   sites sitemap|list
		color color
		icon iconfile|list
		size #
		desc [y|n]
		font font name
		end

     The user may specify the the color of the sites (see section
     on NAMED COLORS below); the icon to be used to represent the
     presence of a site (see the manual entry for p.icons); the
     size of the icon (number of times larger than the size it is
     in the icon file); and whether or not the description
     associated with each site is also to be printed.  If the
     description is to be printed, the font name may be
     specified.	 The size of the font is proportional to the icon
     size.  This example would paint a sites map with blue
     windmills (from an icon file created by the user using the
     p.icons GRASS command) placed at all windmill locations
     (from a sites list).  These windmills would be two times
     larger than the size of the icon in the icon file and have
     descriptions from the sites list file printed beside them.
     EXAMPLE:	sites windmills
		  color blue
		  icon windmill
		  size 2
		  desc y
		  end


text
     Places text on the map.

     USAGE:   text  east north text
	      text  x% y% text
		font fontname
		color color|none
		width #
		hcolor color|none
		hwidth #
		background color|none
		border color|none
		size #
		ref reference point
		xoffset #
		yoffset #
		opaque [y|n]

ps.map <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



		end


     The user specifies where the text will be placed by
     providing map coordinates or percentages of the geographic
     region map.  The text follows these coordinates on the same
     instruction line.	More than one line of text can be
     specified by notating the end of a line with \n (e.g.
     USA\nCERL).


     The user can then specify various text features:

     font: cyrilc gothgbt gothgrt gothitt greekc greekcs greekp
     greeks italicc italiccs italict romanc romancs romand romans
     romant scriptc scripts (The default font is romans);

     color (see NAMED COLORS);

     width of the lines used to draw the text to make thicker
     letters (accepts decimal points [floating points] as well as
     integers);

     size as the vertical height of the letters in meters on the
     ground (text size will grow or shrink depending on the scale
     at which the map is painted);

     the highlight color (hcolor) and the width of the highlight
     color (hwidth);

     the text-enclosing-box background color; the text box border
     color;

     ref.  This reference point specifies the text handle - what
     part of the text should be placed on the location specified
     by the map coordinates.  Reference points can refer to:
     [lower|upper|center] [left|right|center] of the text to be
     printed;

     yoffset, which provides finer placement of text by shifting
     the text a vertical distance in pixels from the specified
     north.  The vertical offset will shift the location to the
     south if positive, north if negative;

     xoffset, which shifts the text a horizontal distance in
     pixels from the specified east The horizontal offset will
     shift the location east if positive, west if negative;

     whether or not the text should be opaque to vectors.
     Entering no to the opaque option will allow the user to see
     any vectors which go through the text's background box.
     Otherwise, they will end at the box's edge.

ps.map <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     This example would place the text SPEARFISH LAND COVER at
     the coordinates E650000 N7365000. The text would be a total
     of 3 pixels wide (2 pixels of red text and 1 pixel black
     highlight), have a white background enclosed in a red box,
     and be 500 meters in size.	 The lower right corner of the
     text would be centered over the coordinates provided.  All
     vectors on the map would stop at the border of this text.
     EXAMPLE:	text 650000 7365000 SPEARFISH LAND COVER
		  font romand
		  color red
		  width 2
		  hcolor black
		  hwidth 1
		  background white
		  border red
		  size 500
		  ref lower left
		  opaque y
		  end



vector
     Selects a vector map layer for output.

     USAGE:   vector vectormap|list
		color color
		width #
		hcolor color
		hwidth #
		masked [y|n]
		style  0-9
		end

     The user can specify the color of the vectors; the width of
     the vectors lines in pixels (accepts decimal points
     [floating points] as well as integers); the highlight color
     (hcolor) for the vector lines; the width of the highlight
     color (hwidth) in pixels; whether or not the raster map
     layer is to be masked by the current mask (see manual entry
     r.mask for more information on the mask); and the line
     style.  The line style allows the vectors to be dashed in
     different patterns.  This is done by typing a series of
     numbers (0's and 1's) in a desired sequence or pattern.
     Blanks and non-digit characters are recognized as 0's. Using
     0 would allow the colors of the raster map layer (or the
     background color if no raster map layer was selected) to
     show through.

     This example would paint a map of the vector map layer named
     streams.  These streams would be a total of 3 pixels wide
     (the inner two pixels blue and the outer highlight pixel



GRASS 5.0beta2	      GRASS Development Team		       13






ps.map <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> ps.map



     white).  The map would not show streams outside of the
     current mask.
     EXAMPLE:	vector streams
		  color blue
		  width 2
		  hcolor white
		  hwidth 1
		  masked y
		  end




verbose
     Changes the amount of talking ps.map will do.

     USAGE: verbose [0|1|2]

     A higher value implies more chatter.  The default is 2.
     This example sets the amount of chatter to a minimum.

     EXAMPLE:	verbose 0



vlegend
     Prints the portion of the map legend containing the vector
     information, on or below the map.

     USAGE:   vlegend
		where x y
		font font name
		fontsize font size
		end

     The default location is immediately below the legend
     containing the scale, grid and region information, starting
     at the left edge of the map.  If the where instruction is
     present and y is less than or equal to zero, the vector
     legend will be positioned immediately below the map,
     starting x inches from the left edge of the page.

     This example prints the vector legend immediately below the
     map and starting 4.5 inches from the left edge of the page,
     using a 12/72 inch Helvetica font.
     EXAMPLE:	vlegend
		  where 4.5 0
		  font Courier
		  fontsize 12
		  end

NAMED COLORS
     The following are the colors that are accepted by ps.map:

     aqua black blue brown cyan gray green grey indigo magenta
     orange purple red violet white yellow



EXAMPLE ps.map INPUT FILE
     The following is an example of a ps.map script file. The
     file has been named spear.soils.  For the purposes of
     illustration, the file is in two columns.	This script file
