NAME
     r.digit - Interactive tool used to draw and save vector
     features on a graphics monitor using a pointing device
     (mouse)

SYNOPSIS
     r.digit

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS tool r.digit provides the user with a way to draw
     lines, areas, and circles on a monitor screen, and to save
     these features in a cell file.  Lines, areas, and circles
     are to be drawn using a pointing device (mouse).  A mouse
     button menu indicates the consequences of pressing each
     mouse button.  The user is requested to enter the category
     number associated with the line, area, or circle
     subsequently drawn by the user.  Lines, areas, and circles
     are defined by the series of points marked by the user
     inside the map window.  r.digit will close areas when the
     user has not.  By drawing a series of such features, the
     user can repair maps, identify areas of interest, or simply
     draw graphics for advertisement.  When drawing is completed,
     a raster map based on the user's instructions is generated.
     It is available for use as a mask, in analyses, and for
     display.

     Digitizing is done in a "polygon" method.	Each area is
     circumscribed completely.	Two or more areas and/or lines
     might define a single part of a map.  Each part of the map,
     however, is assigned only the LAST area or line which
     covered it.

     THE PROCESS:
	  Step 1:  Choose to define an area or line, quit, or
	  finish.  If you quit, the session exits with nothing
	  created.  If you choose to finish (done), you will be
	  prompted for a new map name;	the new map is then
	  created.

	  Step 2:  If you choose to make an area or line you must
	  identify the category number for that area or line.

	  Step 3:  Using the mouse trace the line or circumscribe
	  the area; or, finish (go to Step 1).
