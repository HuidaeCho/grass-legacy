NAME
     r.in.poly - Create raster maps from ascii polygon/line data
     files in the current directory.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.in.poly
     r.in.poly help
     r.in.poly input=name output=name [title="phrase"]
     [rows=value]

DESCRIPTION
     r.in.poly allows the creation of GRASS ASCII files in the
     current directory containing polygon and linear features.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters

     input=name		 Unix input file, in ascii format,
			 containing the polygon and linear
			 features.  The format of this file is
			 described in the section INPUT FORMAT
			 below.

     output=name	 Raster output file

     title="phrase"	 Title for resultant raster map
			 (optional)

     rows		 Number of rows to hold in memory
			 (default: 512).  This parameter allows
			 users with less memory (or more) on
			 their system to control how much memory
			 r.in.poly uses.

INPUT FORMAT
     The input format for the input file consists of sections
     describing either polygonal areas or linear features.  The
     basic format is:
     A			    <for polygonal areas>
	 easting northing
	 .
	 .
	 .
     =	 cat# label
     L			    <for linear features>
	 easting northing
	 .
	 .
	 .
     =	 cat# label
     The A signals the beginning of a polygon. It must appear in

     the first column.	The L signal the beginning of a linear
     feature. It also must appear in the first column. The
     coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, or the
     coordinates defining the linear feature follow and must have
     a space in the first column and at least one space between
     the easting and the northing.  To give meaning to the
     features, the = indicates that the feature currently being
     processed has category value cat# (which must be an integer)
     and a label (which may be more than one word, or which may
     be omitted).
