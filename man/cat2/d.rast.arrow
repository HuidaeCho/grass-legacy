NAME
     d.rast.arrow - Draws arrows representing cell aspect
     direction for a raster map layer.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.rast.arrow
     d.rast.arrow help
     d.rast.arrow [map=name] [type=name] [arrow_color=name]
     [grid_color=name] [x_color=name] [unknown_color=name]

DESCRIPTION
     d.rast.arrow is designed to help users better visualize
     surface water flow direction, as indicated in an aspect
     raster map layer.	There are two ways to specify the aspect
     layer the program is to use.  The first is to display the
     aspect map layer on the graphics monitor before running
     d.rast.arrow.  The second method involves setting the map
     parameter to the name of the desired aspect map.  This
     allows the arrows to be drawn over any other maps already
     displayed on the graphics monitor.

     d.rast.arrow will draw an arrow over each displayed cell to
     indicate in which direction the cell slopes.  An arrow can
     point in one of eight directions.	If the aspect layer has a
     category value denoting locations of "unknown" aspect,
     d.rast.arrow draws a question mark over the displayed cells
     of that category.	Cells of category 0 (no data) will be
     marked with an "X".

      Note:  Arrows are cell size and cannot be seen if the
     raster map is relatively close in scale.  From a command
     line mode, the user cannot run d.rast.arrow and then run
     d.rast.zoom and still see the arrows.  The zooming action
     erases the arrows and the user must run .arrow again.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     map=name	       Name of an existing raster map layer to be
		       displayed.

     type=name	       Type of existing raster data to be
		       displayed.
		       Options:	 grass, agnps, answers
		       Default:	 grass
		       Using this information, d.rast.arrow uses
		       internal information to convert category
		       values into appropriate arrow directions.

     arrow_color=name  Color in which arrows will be drawn.
		       Options:	 white, red, orange, yellow,
