NAME
     r.mode - Finds the mode of values in a cover map within
     areas assigned the same category value in a user-specified
     base map.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.mode
     r.mode help
     r.mode base=name cover=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     r.mode calculates the most frequently occurring value (i.
     e., mode) of data contained in a cover raster map layer for
     areas assigned the same category value in the user-specified
     base raster map layer.  These modes are stored in the new
     output map layer.

     The output map is actually a reclass of the base map.

     If the user simply types r.mode on the command line, the
     user is prompted for the parameter values through the
     standard parser interface (see parser manual entry).

     Alternately, the user can supply all needed parameter values
     on the command line.

     Parameters:

     base=name         An existing raster map layer in the user's
                       current mapset search path.  For each
                       group of cells assigned the same category
                       value in the base map, the mode of the
                       values assigned these cells in the cover
                       map will be computed.

     cover=name        An existing raster map layer containing
                       the values to be used to compute the mode
                       within each category of the base map.

     output=name       The name of a new map layer to contain
                       program output (a reclass of the base
                       map).  The mode values will be stored in
                       the output map.

NOTES
     The user should use the results of r.mode with care.  Since
     this utility assigns a value to each cell which is based on
     global information (i.e., information at spatial locations
     other than just the location of the cell itself), the
     resultant map layer is only valid if the geographic region
     and mask settings are the same as they were at the time that

     Results are affected by the current region settings and
     mask.
