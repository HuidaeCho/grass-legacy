DESCRIPTION
     d.rast.zoom allows the user to zoom in or out of a region of
     interest on the raster map layer currently displayed in the
     active frame of the graphics monitor.  The user zooms in and
     out interactively, using a mouse to establish the zoom
     region.  To zoom, click the left mouse button to establish a
     corner, then drag the mouse to estabilsh the second
     (diagonal) corner and hit the right mouse button to accept
     the region.  "Unzoom" will move back one step (i.e., to the
     last modified region).  If the user tries to unzoom once
     again, the zoom region will be set equal to the default
     region settings.  The user can zoom or unzoom any number of
     times until satisfied.

NOTES
     d.rast.zoom is sensitive to the current mask (see r.mask.

     This program runs only interactively.
