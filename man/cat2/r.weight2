NAME
     r.weight2 - Weighted overlay raster map layer analysis
     program.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.weight2 [output] [action] [color]
     r.weight2 [output=option] [action=option] [color=option]

DESCRIPTION
     r.weight2 is the non-interactive version of r.weight.  Both
     programs allow the user to assign numeric values (i.e.,
     "weights") to individual category values within raster map
     layers.  These weights are then distributed locationally
     throughout a raster map layer based on the distribution of
     the categories with which they are associated.  The user can
     weight the categories of several raster map layers in a data
     base.  Such weighted raster map layers can then be overlain.
     r.weight2 will combine weights in the overlain map layers by
     cell location.

     A resulting output raster map layer depicts the combination
     of map layer weights across a landscape.  These values
     represent a hierarchy of suitability for some user-defined
     purpose.  To obtain a more detailed description, see the
     manual entry for r.weight.

     Output raster map must be specified		       (no default)
     Action must be either (add or mult)		       (default: add)
     Color table for the new raster map (grey | wave | ramp)   (default: grey)

     Once the r.weight2 command line is entered, the user will
     need to enter a raster map layer name and assign numeric
     values to its categories.	Values can be assigned to the
     categories of up to six raster map layers within r.weight2
     in a single analysis.  Help is available to the user by
     typing r.weight2 help.

EXAMPLE
     The following is the format in which data should be entered
     to r.weight2:
	  Raster_layer1
	  [Reclass rule 1a]
	  [Reclass rule 1b]
	  Raster_layer2
	  [Reclass rule 2a]
	  etc.
	  end
     Raster_layer:  raster_map OR "raster_map in mapset"
     Reclass rule: (example)  1 = 5 OR 20 thru 50 = 10 (must leave spaces between
       the category, =, and value entries)

     Example: (the prompts are shown in bold)
	  >  r.weight2 sites add wave
	  >  soils

	       soils>  1 thru 20 = 5
	       soils>  21 thru 30 = 10
	       soils>  landcover

	       landcover>  1 = 2
	       landcover>  2 = 4
	       landcover>  3 thru 8 = 6
	       landcover>  end


NOTES
     The user must be knowledgeable about r.weight to run
     r.weight2.	 r.weight2 does not provide the user with a
     listing of raster map layers or map layer categories.  Users
     unsure about raster map layer names should run the GRASS
     program g.list.  To obtain a listing of the categories for a
     raster map layer run r.report.

     The user can create an input file containing the data needed
     to run r.weight2.	This file must list the raster map layer
     and reclass rules in the format shown in the above example.
     The prompts must not be included in the file.  This file can
     be directed into r.weight2 at the command line by typing
     r.weight2 output action color <  input_file

BUGS
     When entering data for the reclass rules, if the user does
     not include spaces between the category, =, and value, the
     program will assume that the entry is a raster map layer.

NOTICE
     This program is part of the alpha section of the GRASS
     distribution.  Unlike the code in the main section of GRASS,
     the alpha code has not yet been fully tested for one release
     cycle.
