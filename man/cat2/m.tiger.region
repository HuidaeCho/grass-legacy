NAME
     m.tiger.region - Finds geographic region information for
     U.S. Census Bureau TIGER input data.
     (GRASS Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.tiger.region
     m.tiger.region help
     m.tiger.region infile=name [zone=value] [spheroid=name]

DESCRIPTION
     m.tiger.region is a program designed to evaluate a file of
     raw type 1 Census (TIGER) data and determine the geographic
     region covered by that input file.	 Output is sent to
     standard out, and gives the east, west, north, and south
     boundaries for the given input data file.

     If the user specifies the input file name and (optionally)
     the zone number or spheroid to be used on the command line,
     the program will run non-interactively; if no zone number or
     spheroid name is given, the default(s) will be used (see
     below).  Alternately, the user may simply type
     m.tiger.region on the command line; in this case, the
     program will prompt the user for parameter values using the
     standard GRASS parser interface described in the manual
     entry for parser.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     infile=name       Input file name in which raw TIGER data
		       (type 1) are stored.

     zone=value	       Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone
		       for this county.
		       Options:	 -60 - 60
		       Default:	 0

     spheroid=name     Name of spheroid to be used.
		       Default:	 clark66

		       Available spheroids are:

			   australian
			   bessel
			   clark66
			   clark80
			   everest
			   international
			   wgs72
			   wgs84

		       It is recommended that the user choose the
		       clark66 (default) spheroid when dealing
		       with TIGER data as it is the most
		       consistent with the original data.


EXAMPLES
     If the user typed simply:

	  m.tiger.region infile=inputfilename

     program output would look similar to this:

     Number of calculated zones is: 2

     INFO FOR ZONE 1:
     zone number:		      13
     percentage of data points
     in this zone:		       0.799489
     regional spread of points
     within this zone:
     north:			 5092049.155918
     south:			 5049238.983803
     east:			  734139.517650
     west:			  732514.747908

     INFO FOR ZONE 2:
     zone number:		      14
     percentage of data points
     in this zone:		      99.200508
     regional spread of points
     within this zone:
     north:			 5092041.463966
     south:			 5036134.342322
     east:			  398030.217441
     west:			  265527.656108

     If the user does not input the UTM zone number, it is
     calculated for them.  Then the zone number and region
     information are output, and if the program finds that the
     input data contains information in more than one UTM zone,
     then the output is given for all applicable zones.


     If instead the user supplies the UTM zone number, the output
     would look like that shown below:

     REGION FOR THIS DATA FILE:

     north border:		  5092049.155918
     south border:		  5036134.342322

     east border:		   398030.217441
     west border:		   265527.656108

NOTES
     This command must be compiled separately.	It will not
     automatically be included in the compile of the main GRASS
     code.  Although m.tiger.region does not need a FORTRAN
     compiler, it is used to support other TIGER data functions
     (like v.db.rim, v.in.tiger, and rim) which do require access
     to a FORTRAN compiler.

     TIGER data are presented in latitude/longitude format, and
     are converted to UTM coordinates using coordinate conversion
     routines contained in the GRASS library.  If no UTM zone
     number is supplied by the user, the program calculates the
     appropriate zone(s) based on the input data provided.  The
     output then provides the UTM zone numbers found (if more
     than one), the geographic region covered within each zone,
     and the percentage of data points found in each zone.  The
     user must then decide which of these UTM zones contains the
     major or most important portion of data values, so that the
     zone number can be supplied in creating the GRASS location
     to hold the imported data and can be provided to the
     importing program (v.in.tiger).  Zone edges will be extended
     (reasonably) to include data values lying outside the chosen
     zone.  If desired, m.tiger.region can be re-run, supplying
     the chosen zone number, in order to evaluate the region
     edges of the input data set (with the extended zone).
