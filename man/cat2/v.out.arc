NAME
     v.out.arc - Converts GRASS vector files to ARC/INFO's
     "Generate" file format.
     (GRASS Vector Data Export Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.out.arc
     v.out.arc help
     v.out.arc type=name vect=name arc_prefix=name

DESCRIPTION
     v.out.arc is a GRASS data export program that converts files
     in GRASS vector format to ARC/INFO's "Generate" file format.
     The companion program v.in.arc imports data in ARC/INFO's
     "Generate" format and converts them to GRASS vector format.

     This program can be run either non-interactively or
     interactively.  The program will be run non-interactively if
     the user specifies parameter values on the command line
     using the following format:

          v.out.arc type=name vect=name arc_prefix=name

     Alternately, the user can simply type:

          v.out.arc

     on the command line;  in this case, the program will prompt
     the user for parameter values.


     Parameters:

     type=name         Coverage (feature) type.
                       Options:  polygon, line

     vect=name         The name of a GRASS vector file to be
                       converted to ARC/INFO format.

     arc_prefix=name   A prefix to be assigned to the ARC/INFO-
                       format files output by v.out.arc.



INTERACTIVE MODE: USER PROMPTS
     v.out.arc will prompt the user to enter the name of a GRASS
     vector file to be exported to ARC/INFO and for a filename
     prefix to be used in naming the files created by the
     program.

     A GRASS vector file to be exported to ARC/INFO must either
     contain only linear features (i.e., have only line coverage)

     or contain only area edge features (i.e., have only polygon
     coverage).  v.out.arc will begin by asking the user which
     type of coverage (line or polygon) is to be imported:

           COVERAGE TYPE
          Enter "polygon" or "line"
          Hit RETURN to cancel request
          >

     The program then prompts the user for the name of the GRASS
     vector file to be converted to ARC/INFO format:

           VECTOR (DIGIT) FILENAME
          Enter 'list' for a list of existing binary vector files
          Hit RETURN to cancel request
          >

     Next, the user is asked for a file-name prefix to be used in
     naming the output ARC/INFO Generate format files:

           ARC/INFO (GENERATE) FILENAME PREFIX
          Hit RETURN to cancel request
          >

     The filename prefix will be used to name the various files
     that will be created for export to ARC/INFO.  When labeled
     polygon coverage data are exported, three such files will be
     created:  a lines file with the suffix .lin, a label-points
     file with the suffix .lab, and a label-text file with the
     suffix .txt.  When line coverage data are exported, two such
     files will be created: a lines file with the suffix .lin,
     and a label-text file with the suffix .txt.  Export of
     unlabeled polygon or line coverage data will result in
     creation of a lines file (.lin suffix) only.  See the DATA
     FILE FORMATS section for more information on these files.



EXAMPLE
     Linear features and polygon data are made up of the series
     of arcs (aka, vectors) outlining their perimeters.  The
     ARC/INFO Users' Guide, in its discussion of the Ungenerate
     command, explains how line and polygon coverage data can be
     created from files (like prefix.lin and prefix.pol)
     containing the geographic coordinates of these arcs, and
     from files (like prefix.lab) containing the geographic
     coordinates of label-points.  Below is an example which
     illustrates the creation, within ARC/INFO, of a polygon
     coverage data file (named soils) from the files soils.pol
     and soils.lab.

        Arc: GENERATE SOILS

        Generate: INPUT soils.pol
        Generate: LINES
        Generating lines ...
        Generate: INPUT soils.lab
        Generate: POINTS
        Generating points ...
        Generate: QUIT
        Arc: _

     The above example would create a polygon coverage data file
     named soils with label-points. The label-points would have
     ID numbers that correspond to the GRASS category values for
     the polygons in the coverage.  The INFO portion of ARC/INFO
     can be used to associate these label-point ID numbers with
     descriptive text from the soils.txt file.


DATA FILE FORMATS
     LINES FILE, also know as prefix.lin or prefix.pol file:
     This text file is a "Generate" format lines file.  The lines
     option of the ARC/INFO Generate command can be used to read
     this file into ARC/INFO. Each line in the file has a unique
     line-ID number.

     LABEL-POINTS FILE, also known as prefix.lab file:
     This text file will be created by v.out.arc if the vector
     file being exported represents a polygon coverage.
     prefix.lab consists of a list of label-point (x,y)

          3 243458.37 195199.28

     LABEL-TEXT FILE, also known as prefix.txt file:
     In the case of polygon coverage data, this file associates
     an integer category value and a category label ("attribute")
     text string (containing no spaces) with each label-point ID
     number.  In the case of line coverage data, this file
     associates an integer category value and an attribute text
     string with each line-ID number.

     The first column is the row number (which is arbitrary), the
     second column contains the category value, the third column
     holds the line or label-point ID number, and the fourth
     column contains the attribute text string.
