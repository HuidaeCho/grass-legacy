NAME
     i.smap - An imagery function that performs contextual image
     classification using sequential maximum a posteriori (SMAP)
     estimation.
     (GRASS Imagery Program)

SYNOPSIS
     i.smap

     i.smap [-mq] group=name subgroup=name signaturefile=name
        [blocksize=value] output=name

DESCRIPTION
     The i.smap program is used to segment  multispectral  images
     using  a  spectral  class  model known as a Gaussian mixture
     distribution.  Since Gaussian mixture distributions  include
     conventional   multivariate   Gaussian  distributions,  this
     program may also be used  to  segment  multispectral  images
     based on simple spectral mean and covariance parameters.

     i.smap has two modes of operation.  The first  mode  is  the
     sequential  maximum a posteriori (SMAP) mode [1,2]. The SMAP
     segmentation  algorithm  attempts  to  improve  segmentation
     accuracy  by  segmenting  the image into regions rather than
     segmenting each pixel separately (see NOTES).

     The second mode is the more conventional maximum  likelihood
     (ML)  classification which classifies each pixel separately,
     but  requires  somewhat  less  computation.  This  mode   is
     selected with the -m flag (see below).


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flags

     -m   Use maximum likelihood estimation  (instead  of  smap).
          Normal operation is to use SMAP estimation (see NOTES).

     -q   Run quietly, without printing  messages  about  program
          progress.   Without this flag, messages will be printed
          (to stderr) as the program progresses.

     Parameters

     group
          imagery group

          The  imagery  group  that  defines  the  image  to   be
          classified.

     subgroup
          imagery subgroup

i.smap <alpha>       GRASS Reference Manual        <alpha> i.smap



          The subgroup within the group specified that  specifies
          the  subset  of  the  band files that are to be used as
          image data to be classified.

     signaturefile
          imagery signaturefile

          The  signature  file   that   contains   the   spectral
          signatures (i.e., the statistics) for the classes to be
          identified  in  the  image.   This  signature  file  is
          produced by the program i.gensigset (see NOTES).

     blocksize
          size of submatrix to process at one time
          default: 128

          This option specifies the size of the  "window"  to  be
          used when reading the image data.

          This program was written to be nice about memory  usage
          without  influencing the resultant classification. This
          option allows the user to control how  much  memory  is
          used. More memory may mean faster (or slower) operation
          depending on how much real memory your machine has  and
          how much virtual memory the program uses.

          The size of the submatrix used in segmenting the  image
          has  a  principle function of controlling memory usage;
          however, it also  can  have  a  subtle  effect  on  the
          quality  of  the  segmentation  in  the smap mode.  The
          smoothing parameters  for  the  smap  segmentation  are
          estimated separately for each submatrix.  Therefore, if
          the image  has  regions  with  qualitatively  different
          behavior,   (e.g.,   natural   woodlands  and  man-made
          agricultural  fields)  it  may  be  useful  to  use   a
          submatrix  small  enough  so  that  different smoothing
          parameters may be used for each distinctive  region  of
          the image.

          The submatrix size has no effect on the performance  of
          the ML segmentation method.

     output
          output raster map.

          The  name  of  a  raster  map  that  will  contain  the
          classification results.  This new raster map layer will
          contain categories that can  be  related  to  landcover
          categories on the ground.

INTERACTIVE MODE
     If none of the arguments are specified on the command  line,

     i.smap  will  interactively prompt for the names of the maps
     and files.

NOTES
     The SMAP algorithm exploits the fact that nearby  pixels  in
     an  image  are  likely  to have the same class.  It works by
     segmenting the image at various scales  or  resolutions  and
     using  the  course  scale  segmentations  to guide the finer
     scale segmentations.  In addition to reducing the number  of
     misclassifications,  the  SMAP  algorithm generally produces
     segmentations with larger connected regions of a fixed class
     which may be useful in some applications.

     The  amount  of  smoothing  that   is   performed   in   the
     segmentation is dependent of the behavior of the data in the
     image.  If the data suggests that the  nearby  pixels  often
     change  class, then the algorithm will adaptively reduce the
     amount of smoothing.  This ensures  that  excessively  large
     regions are not formed.
