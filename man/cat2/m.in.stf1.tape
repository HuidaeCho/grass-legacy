NAME
     m.in.stf1.tape - Filter to extract lines from a text file
     based on column contents, especially for Bureau of the
     Census STF1 files.
     (GRASS Support Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.in.stf1.tape
     m.in.stf1.tape help
     m.in.stf1.tape -f
     m.in.stf1.tape [-n] sc=str [sc=str . . .] < infile > outfile

     This program must be run in command mode only.


PARAMETERS
     sc is a starting column number of a desired field in the
     input file, or is the name of one of the Identification
     Section field names for the STF1 records (all upper case
     letters), and str is a string to match against input lines
     starting at column sc. sc=str may be repeated resulting in a
     conjunction (anding) of the results of each sc=str
     expression.  A '?' may be used as a single character wild
     card in str; if sc=str contains '?' or other shell
     interpreted characters, it should be protected in quotes.
     Preceeding sc by 'N', or preceeding the = by '!' reverses
     the sense of the test ("not equals").

     Examples:
     m.in.stf1.tape 11=050  < infile > outfile
     m.in.stf1.tape SUMLEV=050	< infile > outfile
     m.in.stf1.tape 1=T450 '7=Bu??s' < infile > outfile
     m.in.stf1.tape 51=tract N37=9753 < infile > outfile
     m.in.stf1.tape 51=tract 37!=9753 < infile > outfile

     Running the program with the -f flag generates the list of
     STF1 Identification Section field names to stdout.


DESCRIPTION
     This is a text filter program written in C especially to
     work with the Census STF1 files, but useful for selecting
     subsets of lines from any text file.  It will work with
     arbitrarily long input lines, up to 10,000 characters.
     Input lines may be of variable length.

     A sc=str condition which refers to columns beyond the end of
     the input line is assumed to be true.

     Multiple tests are 'anded' into a single test; that is,
     lines which pass all tests are written to the output file.

     Null characters are always filtered out; thus, this program
     can be used as a null filter by specifying a sc=str
     condition which will always be true (e.g., '1=?').	 In the
     same way, files with lines terminated with <LF><CR> or just
     <CR> can be "fixed" to have the standard Unix <LF>
     terminator.

     NOTE: One special property of m.in.stf1.tape is that it will
     pad (with 0) its output lines to 4806 characters if the line
     begins with the characters "STF1" and is greater than 4000
     characters long.  Experience has shown that some STF1
     records are a few characters short (but no data has been
     omitted), and this corrects them so that other programs will
     be able to read full lines.


BUGS/FEATURES
     Input lines must be terminated with <LF>, <CR> or <LF><CR>.
     Output lines will be terminated with <LF> only.

     Input characters lexically less than 'space' (32 decimal;
     the "control" characters) which are not line terminators
     will be perceived as line terminators and thus cause
     improper functioning.


SEE ALSO
     For extracting lines from files, Unix programs such as grep,
     or awk are somewhat more flexible than m.in.stf1.tape, but
     have line length limitations and do not adapt to lines
     terminated with <LF> and <CR>.

     This program was created as a preprocessor for Census STF1
     files, to produce input files for the program
     v.apply.census.  The program m.in.stf1.db3 performs the same
     preprocessing function for the Census STF1 files distributed
     in "dBase 3" format on CD-ROM.

     This program is part of the alpha section of the GRASS
     distribution.  Unlike the code in the main section of GRASS,
     the alpha code has not yet been fully tested for one release
     cycle.
