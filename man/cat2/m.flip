m.flip <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> m.flip



NAME
     m.flip - Flips elevation data extracted from systems that
     retrieve data by rows from south to north.
     (GRASS Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.flip
     m.flip help
     m.flip [-q] input=name output=name rows=value cols=value
     bpc=value

DESCRIPTION
     m.flip is similar to m.rot90.  However, rather than rotating
     a raster file, m.flip flips the contents of the raster
     generated by tape extraction programs about the east-west
     axis.  Flipping may be necessary to compensate for the
     orientation of the data read from tape.  This program can be
     used in conjunction with the program r.in.ll to convert this
     rotated data into GRASS raster format.

     m.flip requires five inputs to be entered by the user.
     These parameters and the optional flag setting are described
     below.

     Flag:

     -q		       Run quietly, suppressing output of
		       messages on program progress to standard
		       output.

     Parameters:

     input=name	       The full pathname of an existing file
		       containing the data to be flipped.

     output=name       The full pathname of the output file in
		       which the rotated data are to be stored.

     rows=value	       The number of rows of data in the input
		       file.  Values must be positive integers.

     cols=value	       The number of columns of data in the input
		       file.  Values must be positive integers.

     bpc=value	       The number of bytes per cell (i.e., per
		       data value) in the input file.  Values
		       must be positive integers.

EXAMPLE
     The following command:





GRASS 5.0beta2	      GRASS Development Team			1






m.flip <alpha>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <alpha> m.flip



	  m.flip  input=/tmp/foo.out  output=/tmp/flip.out
	  rows=301  cols=358  bpc=2

     will rotate the file /tmp/foo.out, and place the rotated
     file in /tmp/flip.out.  Here, the input file is 301 rows by
     358 columns, at 2 bytes per data value.

     distribution.  Unlike the code in the main section of GRASS,
     the alpha code has not yet been fully tested for one release
     cycle.
