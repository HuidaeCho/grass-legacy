DESCRIPTION
     This program creates a GRASS site or vector map of Census
     "Landmark" features in the current mapset (UTM or Lat-Long
     locations only) with labelled points, areas or lines
     constructed from the TIGER file records.  Each point or area
     Landmark is a record in the Type 7 TIGER/Line file for a
     county.

     The user may select the Landmark Features to include in the
     new map by specifying CFCC's (Census Feature Classification
     Code), or by specifying text string(s) to match with the
     Landmark Feature Name field.  [Many Landmark records do not
     have an entry in the Feature Name field, so use the string

     matching selection with care.]

     Point Landmarks are generated only from information in the
     Type 7 file.  Area Landmarks, which often comprise several
     individually labelled polygons, are generated from data in
     TIGER file Types 7, 8, I, P, 1 and 2 (in order of use).

     When making "line" maps, this program functions as a
     selection front end to the v.in.tig.basic program; see that
     programs documentation for the information on how these line
     maps will be labelled.

     TIGER/Line files from multiple counties should not be mixed
     or concatenated when using this program.

     The program should function well independent of the
     termination character(s) at the end of each line in the
     input files.  <LF>, <CR>, neither, one, or both are
     acceptable.  Different distribution media apparently have
     different record delimiting characters.


THE COMMAND MODE OF OPERATION
     Starting v.in.tig.lndmk with the -s flag invokes the command
     mode of operation.  Commands are expected from stdin, that
     is, the a terminal or a file redirected with '|' or '<'.
     When using a terminal for input, the prompt lists the
     available commands thus:
     .p(oints) .a(reas) .l(ines) .c(ode)list
     .s(trings) .m(atch)both .e(nd) .ex(it) >>

                   Syntax for the dot commands

     .points [site_map]
            lines containing requested CFCC Codes
            (CFCC>> prompt will be given if input is from a
     terminal)
     .end

     .areas [vect_map]
            lines containing requested CFCC Codes
            (CFCC>> prompt will be given if input is from a
     terminal)
     .end

     .lines [vect_map]
            lines containing requested CFCC Codes
            (CFCC>> prompt will be given if input is from a
     terminal)
     .end

     .strings [output_file]

     The details of the dot commands

     Note:  Always use the .strings, .matchboth and/or .codes
     commands prior to creating a map with .points, .areas or
     .lines.

     .points mapname begins the process of making a GRASS4.1 site
     map of point locations.  This site map name takes precedence
     over the site=name parameter that may be given on the
     command line.

     Specification of the CFCC's, if any, for the features you
     want included in the map should be done on the line(s)
     following .points and should conclude with a line containing
     .end, which begins the map generation process.  The CFCC's
     should be of the form Dnn (e.g., D00; D10 D85 | D23, H12);
     several may be given on one line, separated by any common
     separator character.  Requested CFCC's may be abbreviated to
     D1 (meaning D10 through D19) or just D (meaning D00 through
     D99).

     If matching text strings are desired (see .strings'fR), they
     must be specified prior to the .points command.

     .areas mapname begins the process of making a GRASS4.1
     vector map of polygons (areas).  This vector map name takes
     precedence over the vect=name parameter that may be given on
     the command line.  Specification of the CFCC's, if any, for
     the features you want included in the map should be done on
     the line(s) following .areas and should conclude with a line
     containing .end, which begins the map generation process.

     If matching text strings are desired (see .strings'fR), they
     must be specified prior to the .areas command.

     .lines mapname begins the process of making a GRASS4.1
     vector map of lines.  This option uses only the Type 1 and 2
     TIGER files.  It searches the Type 1 records for the

     specified CFCC's and matches any specified text strings to
     the Feature Name (FENAME) field in the Type 1 records.
     Specification of the CFCC's, if any, for the features you
     want included in the map should be done on the line(s)
     following .areas and should conclude with a line containing
     .end, which begins the map generation process.

     If matching text strings are desired (see .strings'fR), they
     must be specified prior to the .lines command.

     .codes searches the Type 7 Landmark file and sends to
     stdout, or to a file if one specified, the CFCC and the
     Classification description of each CFCC present.  If a 'P'
     or 'A' is specified, both the point and area codes present
     are listed.  'L' lists the CFCC codes contained in the Type
     1 file.  The default type, if no type is specified, is 'P'.
     This command is provided as a useful aid to the user.

     .strings records up to 10 following lines (until ".end") as
     text strings to match to the Landmark Feature Name Field in
     the Type 7 records (Type 1 for making ".line" maps).  A
     match is made if any of the specfied strings is a substring
     of the Feature Name.  If exact case matching is required,
     '!' should be the first character of the entered text
     strings.  Example:  The Feature Name "Walter Reed Army
     Hospital" would be matched by any of the following strings.

       !Walt
       hosp
       Reed
       army hosp

     If the optional filename parameter is given, Type 7 records
     which match the specified strings are reported to that file,
     otherwise they are reported to stdout.

     .matchboth is used to specify that a Landmark record (or
     Type 1 record for ".lines") must match both one of the
     specified CFCC's and one of the specified text strings to be
     selected.  A match to either condition is the default mode,
     and can be explicitly set or reset by the optional "no"
     parameter; i.e., .matchboth no.

     .exit is used to exit from the program.



THE INTERACTIVE MODE OF OPERATION
     The following "VASK" menus will be encountered in using the
     interactive mode of this program.  Comments following each
     menu will help you decide how to answer the questions and
     create products.

            GRASS IMPORT FROM CENSUS LANDMARK FEATURE RECORDS

     STEP 1:  Select Type(s) of features to be extracted

        There are Point and Area (polygon) Landmark feature types.
          in the Landmark (Type 7) Records

        There may also be some Line (vector) Landmark features
          in the Basic Data (Type 1) Records

        Mark one feature type you wish extracted:

                        Point   x
                        Area    _

            AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                          (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

     Comments:  This is the "Main Menu."  You must select (by
     entering 'x') one of the Point, Area or Line choices.  The
     viewing of the CFCC codes is optional, but is usually done
     initially.

     The following screen results from a request to View CFCC
     Codes after selecting Point features:

     Comments:  You may request to see the list on the screen, or
     have the list sent to a file in your home directory, or
     both.  If you request neither, the program returns to the
     Main Menu.  Both point and area landmarks are reported if
     either "Point" or "Area" was selected on the Main Menu.  If
     "Line" was requested on the Main Menu, all the CFCC codes in
     the Type 1 (Basic Data Record) file will be tabulated (this
     can be a useful product for other purposes); remember that
     the Type 1 file is large and this processing may take a few
     minutes or more.

BUGS/RESTRICTIONS
     Some area features are included in the Type 7 (Landmark)
     file which do not fit the definition given of "Landmark"
     (CFCC's beginning with 'D'), as a mechanism to have them
     included in the Tiger/Line data.  Many Hydrography area
     features fall in this category for some counties.  Also,
     there may be records in both the Type 1 and Type 7 files for
     some Landmark features, such as airports, and to make a
     complete airport map for a county both sets must be
     extracted.

     In the first trials of this program is was discovered that
     the TIGER/Line files have several defects in topological



GRASS 4.1                U.S. Army CERL                         7

     completeness when area landmark polygons are created.  These
     defects express themselves when v.support is run
     (automatically) to attach labels to the polygons and is
     unable to attach one or more label points.  Some editing
     with v.digit should be able to resolve these problems.

     Caution: This program will overwrite an existing vector map
     of the same name without warning.  Site_list maps will not
     be overwritten.

     Since this program opens many TIGER files at once, the set
     for a county must reside on a disk or CD-ROM, not tape.
     Only file types 1, 2, 7, 8, I and P are used so only those
     would have to be copied from tape to disk.


SEE ALSO
     v.in.tig.basic is called automatically to produce the area
     and line maps.
     v.apply.census will generate polygon labels for Census
     tracts, block groups, etc., from STF1 or PL94-171 files.
