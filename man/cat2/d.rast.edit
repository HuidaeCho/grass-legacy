DESCRIPTION
     The _d._r_a_s_t._e_d_i_t program allows users to interactively edit
     cell category values in a raster map layer displayed to the
     graphics monitor using a mouse cursor.  This program
     determines the name of the raster map layer currently
     displayed in the active frame on the selected graphics
     monitor (if none, program will abort).  The user is then
     prompted for the name of a new raster layer to be created in
     his mapset.  _d._r_a_s_t._e_d_i_t does not modify the user's original
     raster map layer.

Geographic Region Concerns
     _d._r_a_s_t._e_d_i_t reads the region definition for the raster map
     layer being edited from its cell header file.  The new,
     edited copy of the raster layer will be created with the
     same resolution and region dimensions.  If the current
     region resolution does not match the raster map layer's
     resolution, the program will abort.  The north, south, east,
     and west geographic region settings of the current region
     can be set to any view, as long as they fall within the
     boundaries of the raster map layer described in its cell
     header.  This is important, since the current view must be
     such that individual cell locations are easily visible and
     sufficiently large on the graphics monitor to be pointed at
     with the mouse cursor.  Any mask in place will be ignored
     when writing the new raster map layer.

Mouse Menus
     Cell editing is done using a mouse cursor to choose menu
     selections and indicate areas on the displayed raster map
     that are to be edited.

     Selections available via the _M_a_i_n _M_e_n_u and the subsequent
     functions or sub-menus are described below:

          1. Edit
               invokes edit mode, during which no graphic menus
               are used, so that none of the displayed map is
               hidden. At the start of the edit mode, a grid is
               drawn over displayed cells to help distinguish
               cell boundaries. Interaction with the program

               during edit mode is done by using the three mouse
               buttons as follows:

               Left Button
                    what's here.  Identify the category value of
                    the cell under the mouse cursor when the
                    button is pressed.  The category value of
                    this cell is printed in the text frame.

               Middle Button
                    edit.  The current category value of the cell
                    under the mouse cursor is iterated and a
                    prompt for a new cell value appears on the
                    textual command frame.  (Remember to move the
                    mouse to the text frame).  Enter a new cell
                    category value which is within the range of
                    current category values for the map layer.
                    Note:  the edited cell is displayed in the
                    color of the newly-assigned category value,
                    but is hatched with lines of the grid color
                    to indicate it has been edited, since, if the
                    value of the cell is polled (before leaving
                    edit mode), the old category value will be
                    reported.

               Right Button
                    exit edit mode.  Command is returned to the
                    _M_a_i_n _M_e_n_u on the graphics monitor.  If cell
                    value changes were made during edit mode,
                    they will be saved upon exit.

          2. Redraw
               redisplays the raster map layer on the graphics
               monitor.

          3. Zoom
               calls the _d._r_a_s_t._z_o_o_m program, to allow changing
               the view of the raster layer.  Zoom's instructions
               will appear on the text command window.
               Interaction is conducted using mouse keys.

          4. Arrow
               This function is available for users editing
               aspect maps.  The _d._r_a_s_t._a_r_r_o_w program is called,
               which draws arrows over the displayed cells to
               indicate the downslope direction of the cell.
               After selecting the _a_r_r_o_w selection from the main
               menu, sub-menus will appear, allowing input
               options to be set for the _d._r_a_s_t._a_r_r_o_w program.
               The first sub-menu selects the type of aspect data
               displayed.  (regular "GRASS" format, as produced
               by _r._s_l_o_p_e._a_s_p_e_c_t; a format prepared as input to

d.rast.edit <alpha>  GRASS Reference Manual   <alpha> d.rast.edit



               the "AGNPS" program; and a format prepared for the
               "ANSWERS" program. The _d._r_a_s_t._a_r_r_o_w program can
               accept the name of a layer not drawn on the
               display for use as input, and an option is given
               to input the name of that layer, if desired.
               Otherwise, the currently displayed map layer will
               be used.  Next, the color options of _d._r_a_s_t._a_r_r_o_w
               may be set via separate menus, or a choice for
               using default settings may be used.

          5. Number
               calls the _d._r_a_s_t._n_u_m program, which will print the
               cell category values over the displayed cells on
               the graphic monitor.

          6. Exit
               quit the _d._r_a_s_t._e_d_i_t program.  If edits have been
               made, the new raster map layer will be created.
               Support files are constructed.  Category labels
               and color maps (if any) are copied from the
               original layer.  _d._r_a_s_t._e_d_i_t redisplays the
               original raster map file on the monitor as it
               exits.

NOTES
     _d._r_a_s_t._e_d_i_t will not create a new raster map layer if the
     user makes no cell edits while running the program.

     Be careful not to cover the graphics monitor window with
     another frame during the editing process.  In some cases,
     the _r_e_d_r_a_w option will be able to remove traces of other
     frames;  otherwise, the graphics monitor will not be
     refreshed until after _d._r_a_s_t._e_d_i_t exits.  Further note,
     however, that this has only been tested on _S_U_N workstations,
     using a modified _S_U_N_V_I_E_W graphics monitor driver.

     The primary bane of the _d._r_a_s_t._e_d_i_t program involves large
     map layers (with lots of rows and columns) and/or slow
     computers, since the program must read and write raster map
     layers row by row for the full size of the map layer as
     dictated by its region size and resolution.  (The current
     region settings of north, south, east, and west will not
     limit the size of the edited copy of the map layer, since by
     use of the _d._r_a_s_t._z_o_o_m program, these values may change
     several times during the editing session). Their effects
     could be lessened if the program were to create a table of
     changes that it could incorporate into the new raster file
     on a forked process started when the user exits, or
     otherwise allow the user to issue a "save" command when he
     has made all desired edits to the raster file.  Currently,
     for instance, if the user needs to use _d._r_a_s_t._z_o_o_m to access
     a different area of the map, he must wait for a read and

     write for each entrance and egress of the edit mode.

     There is no "undo" command or way to exit edit mode without
     saving changes.

     It would be nice to incorporate a scrollable version of
     _d._l_e_g_e_n_d (such that one could see a legend for files with
     many categories on a standard size sub-frame).  It would be
     even nicer to be able to select the category values from a
     graphical legend when editing cell values (thereby saving a
     trip to the text frame to type in the new value).

     Perhaps method(s) for multiple  or mass cell edits would be
     useful.  This could be done by providing modes in which the
     user may: 1) edit a block of cells to a given value by
     drawing a box; 2) be able to choose a given value which is
     automatically used as the new value on each cell chosen
     until a different value is desired.

     There is no interrupt handling.  This could leave files in
     .tmp or (rarely) result in half-baked raster files.  The
     original file would survive unscathed by an interrupt at
     most any point in execution, but the graphics monitor may be
     left in an indeterminate state (try _d._e_r_a_s_e or _d._m_o_n
     _s_e_l_e_c_t=_m_o_n_i_t_o_r__n_a_m_e to bring it back into shape).  Beware of
     exiting the program by means other than using _e_x_i_t on the
     _M_a_i_n _M_e_n_u.


     The program has no method to enter new values beyond the
     current range of categories, but additional programming
     could make it so.
