NAME
     i.tape.tm.fast - An imagery function that extracts Thematic
     Mapper (TM) imagery from tape media
     (GRASS Image Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     i.tape.tm.fast
     i.tape.tm.fast help
     i.tape.tm.fast [-q] input=name group=name
     bands=value[,value,...] [rows=firstrow-lastrow]
     [cols=firstcol-lastcol] [title=name]

DESCRIPTION
     i.tape.tm.fast is a program that extracts TM imagery from
     tape media with different blocking factors (its value
     indicates how many rows are combined into one physical
     record on the tape).

     i.tape.tm.fast must be run in a LOCATION_NAME with a (x,y)
     coordinate system (i.e., a coordinate system with projection
     0). For further information regarding the LOCATION_NAME
     type, please refer to the imagery manual entry.

     i.tape.tm.fast reads the blocking factor from the header
     file as well as other parameters, such as gains and offsets
     for each band, map projection, sun elevation and azimuth,
     etc., and writes into history file (depending upon the
     contents of the header file).

OPTIONS
     This program can be run either non-interactively or
     interactively. It will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies the name of input device, the name of output group
     file, bands to be extracted, and optionally other parameters
     (see below) on the command line using the form:

          i.tape.tm.fast [-q] input=name group=name
          bands=value[,value,...] [rows=firstrow-lastrow]
          [cols=firstcol-lastcol] [title=name]

     where the input should be the device name on which the tape
     media are mounted. The group is an imagery group which will
     store the extracted TM imagery. The bands value in a list
     separated by commas is the bands the user wants to extract
     from the imagery. The rows and cols represent the region
     which the user wishes to extract, where the default is whole
     imagery.  At last an optional title is for information only.
     Alternatively, the program will be run interactively if the
     user types only i.tape.tm.fast; in this case the program
     will prompt the user for parameter values using the standard
     GRASS parser interface described in the manual entry for
     parser.

     Flags:

     -q                Run quietly.  Supresses output of program
                       percent-complete messages.  If this flag
                       is not used, these messages are printed
                       out.


     Parameters:

     input=name        The name of the device on which the tape
                       media containing the imagery files
                       mounted.


     group=name        The name of the group, which will store
                       the imagery extracted from tape media.

     bands=value[,value,...]
                       The bands the user wishes to extracted
                       from the tape media.
                       Options: 1-7

     rows=firstrow-lastrow
                       The values of first and last row of the
                       extracting region.
                       Default: full imagery

     cols=firstcol-lastcol
                       The values of first and last column of the
                       extracting region.
                       Default: full imagery

     title=name        The title of the extracting imagery.
                       Default: TM Imagery File Extracted from
                       Tape


NOTES
     Running in command line mode, i.tape.tm.fast will overwrite
     the group file and support files without prompting if the
     files existed.
