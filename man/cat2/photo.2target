     This is not a command in itself, but an option to the
     command i.ortho.photo.



NAME
     photo.2target - An imagery function that enables you to mark
     control points on an image to be ortho-rectified, and then
     input the coordinates of each control point for
     determination  of ortho-rectification parameters.  The
     ortho-rectification parameters are required as input for the
     GRASS program photo.rectify.
     (GRASS Imagery Processing Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Selected from i.ortho.photo

DESCRIPTION
     photo.2target is an imagery function that enables you to
     mark control points on an image to be ortho-rectified and
     then input the coordinates of each point for calculation of
     rectification parameters.

     Rectification is the mapping of an image from one coordinate
     system to another.  The geometry of an image extracted into
     a GRASS LOCATION having an x,y coordinate system is not
     planimetric.  To create a planimetric image, that is, to
     convert the x,y coordinate system into a standard coordinate
     system (for example, the UTM coordinate system or the State
     Plane coordinate system), points from a map having the
     standard coordinates must be associated with the same points
     on the image to be rectified.

     The ortho-rectification parameters are computed in two
     phases. The first phase computes a transformation matrix
     between image (row,col) coordinates and photo (x,y)
     coordinates relative to the perspective center. The
     transformation matrix is computed explicitly in the option
     photo.2image.

     The second phase, photo.2target, enables you to mark control
     points on the image and then input the standard coordinates
     (Easting,Northing, and elevation) to determine the
     parameters for a three dimensional projective
     transformation.

     photo.init may be run before running photo.2target to modify
     the initial camera exposure station parameters, and/or
     modify the standard deviation of these parameters.
     photo.init is not required but generally is helpful.

     During the process of marking control points and entering

     standard coordinates, you may compute the RMS (root mean
     square) error for each control point entered.  photo.2target
     does this by calculating the transformation equation, and
     then plugging these results into an equation for RMS error.

     photo.2target offers a zoom option to locate precisely the
     point to be marked on an image. This program also offers you
     the option of acquiring standard coordinates for a marked
     point from a map layer in the target database, or from a
     digitizer.

     To run photo.2target, a graphics monitor is required.

     The procedure for marking points, entering coordinates, and
     calculating RMS error is described below.

     The terminal screen displays the following message:

                           use mouse now...

     The graphics monitor displays the following screen:

     Any single file in the imagery group may be used to mark
     points, and you can mark points on more than one file
     in the imagery group to accumulate the 12 points suggested minimum.
     Any file in the imagery group can be rectified (using
     photo.rectify) based on the rectification parameters
     computed from these control points.

     The imagery file you select is displayed in the upper
     left quadrant of the screen.

ZOOM
     To magnify the displayed file, you must place the mouse
     cross hairs on the word ZOOM. The following menu will then
     be displayed at the bottom of the screen:

     You may identifying the zoom window either by using the
     mouse to make a box, or by using the mouse to mark the
     center of the window and entering a magnification factor.
     The terminal screen will display a mouse button menu to
     guide you in identifying the window.


MARKING POINTS
     To mark the points on the image that correspond to the
     points on a standard coordinate system map, you must place
     the mouse cross hairs on the corresponding location on the
     image to be marked and press the left hand button on the
     mouse.  A diamond shaped symbol will be marked on the image.
     The terminal will display the following menu:

     mouse;  the marked point then disappears.


PLOT CELL
     In addition to acquiring control points from a standard map,
     you have the option of acquiring the  points from a cell-map
     in the target database.  The database map is displayed by
     placing the mouse cross hairs on the words PLOT CELL.  The
     following line is then displayed at the bottom of the
     monitor:

     The coordinates for the target database map are

ANALYZE
     After a number of points have been marked (4 to 7), you can
     check the RMS error of the points marked on the image.  This
     is done by placing the mouse cross hairs on the word ANALYZE
     at the bottom of the monitor.  An error report resembling

     The RMS error for the image is given under the column titled
     "error" and subtitled "east" and "north".  In the above
     report, point number 1 is 0.0 and -0.9 meters (east and
     north) from the predicted location calculated from the
     transformation equation. The RMS error for the target map is
     listed under the heading "target".  This is the RMS error
     for the east and north coordinates of the target map but it
     is presented in the table using one general value.  The
     overall RMS error is displayed at the bottom of the screen
     in meters.  Points that create high RMS error are displayed
     in red on the monitor (represented here in italics).

     The image coordinates of the point marked on the imagery
     group file is given under the heading "image" and the
     subheadings "east" and "north".  The location of the control
     point in the target database is given under the heading
     "control" and the subheadings "east","north", and "elev".
     If you would like to exclude or include a control point,
     this can be accomplished by placing the mouse cross hairs on
     the control point number to be included (if the point is
     absent) or excluded (if the point is displayed) and pressing
     the left button on the mouse twice.  When a point is
     excluded, it is not afterwards included in the calculation
     of the RMS error, or included in the final rectification
     parameters. However, it can be retrieved within
     photo.2target at any time by double clicking with the mouse
     as described above.

QUIT
     To end the photo.2target program place the mouse cross hairs
     on the word QUIT;  the marked control points (including
     coordinates) will be saved.

NOTES
     During the course of marking control points and computing
     the ortho-rectification parameters, a matrix inversion error
     may occur.  This is caused by trying to invert a non-
     singular normal equation matrix.  When this situation
     arises, the status of all previously selected control points
     are modified, the control points are excluded.  Running
     photo.init for the selected imagery group with accurate
     camera exposure station parameters should remedy the
     situation.  The excluded control points may again be
     included as described in the section ANALYZE.


     A good rule of thumb is to mark at least 12 to 15 points
     which are evenly distributed over the entire imagery group
     file in order to obtain an accurate transformation
     parameters for the rectification process.  The RMS error may
     increase with more points added, but the transformation
     parameters will be more accurate over the entire image.

photo.2target <alpha> GRASS Reference Manual<alpha> photo.2target



     An RMS error of less than or equal to approximately one
     resolution unit (pixel) for the image being rectified is
     generally considered acceptable.
