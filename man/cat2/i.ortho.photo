NAME
     i.ortho.photo - An interactive imagery function for the
     ortho-rectification of imagery group files.
     (GRASS Image Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     i.ortho.photo

DESCRIPTION
     i.ortho.photo allows the user to ortho-rectify imagery group
     files. An imagery group consists of several scanned aerial
     photographs (raster files) of a common area. Imagery groups
     can be created or modified using the GRASS Image Processing
     Program i.group, or using the first menu option described
     below.  i.ortho.photo guides the user through the steps
     required to ortho-rectify the raster files in a single
     imagery group.

     The first menu in i.ortho.photo provides the user with the
     following options:

          Initialization Options
          1) Select/Modify imagery group
          2) Select/Modify imagery group target
          3) Select/Modify target elevation model
          4) Select/Modify imagery group camera

          Transformation Parameter Computation
          5) Compute image-to-photo transformation parameters
          6) Compute photo-to-target transformation parameters
          7) Initialize exposure station parameters

          Ortho-rectification Option
          8) Ortho-rectify imagery group raster files

          RETURN to exit
          >


     The options are described as follows:

     Select/Modify imagery group
          The current imagery group is display at the top of the
          previous menu.  You may select another (new or
          existing) imagery group for the ortho-rectification
          program using option (1).  After choosing option (1)
          you will be prompted for the name of a new or existing
          imagery group.  Option (1) using the GRASS Image
          Processing Program i.group, for creation or
          modification of imagery groups.  For more information
          on imagery group creation or modification please the
          the GRASS manual page for i.group.

     Select/Modify imagery group target
          The target location and mapset may be selected or
          modified using option (2).  After choosing option (2)
          you will be prompted for the names of the target
          location and mapset, where the ortho-rectified raster
          files will reside.  The target location is also the
          location from which the elevation model (raster file)
          will be selected -- see option (3). Option (2) uses the
          GRASS Image Processing Program i.target, for selection
          or modification of the imagery group target location
          and mapset. For more information on imagery group
          selection or modification please the the GRASS manual
          page for i.target.


     Select/Modify imagery group
          Option (3) allows you to select the raster file from
          the target location to be used as the elevation model.
          The elevation model is required for both the
          computation of photo-to-target parameters (option 6)
          and for the ortho-rectification of the imagery group
          files (option 8).  The raster file select for the
          elevation model should cover the entire area of the
          image group to be ortho-rectified.  Currently, the
          elevation model raster file is expected to be in units
          of meters.  DTED and DEM files are suitable for use as
          the elevation model in the ortho-rectification program.
          After selection option (3) you will be prompted for the
          name of the raster file in the target location that you
          want to use as the elevation model.


     Select/Modify imagery group camera
          Using option (4) you may select or create an camera
          reference file that will be used with the current
          imagery group.  A camera reference file contains
          information on the internal characteristics of the
          aerial camera, as well as the geometry of the fiducial
          or reseau marks.  The most important characteristic of
          the camera is its focal length.  Fiducial or reseau
          marks locations are required to compute the scanned
          image to photo-coordinate transformation parameter
          (option 5).  For a more detailed description of option
          (4) please see the GRASS manual page for photo.camera.


     Compute image-to-photo transformation parameters
          The scanned image to photo-coordinate transformation
          parameters are computed using option (5).  In this
          interactive option you associate scanned reference
          points (fiducials, reseau marks, etc.) with their known
          photo coordinates from the camera reference file.

          Complete documentation for this option is available
          under the manual entry photo.2image.


     Compute photo-to-target transformation parameters
          The photo to target transformation parameters are
          compute using option(6).  Here control points are
          marked on one or more imagery group files and
          associated with there known UTM and elevation
          coordinates. Complete documentation for this option is
          available under the manual entry photo.2target.


     Select initial exposure station parameters
          If option (7) is selected, initial camera exposure
          station parameters and initial variances may be
          selected or modified.  Complete documentation for this
          option is available under the manual entry photo.init.


     Ortho-photo imagery group files
          Option (8) is used to perform the actual image ortho-
          rectification after all of the transformation
          parameters have been computed.  Ortho-rectified raster
          files will be created in the target location for each
          selected imagery group file.  You may select either the
          current window in the target location or the minimal
          bounding window for the ortho-rectified image.
          Complete documentation for this option is available
          under the manual entry photo.rectify.


NOTES
     i.ortho.photo currently requires the elevation model to be
     in meters, and the target location to be a UTM coordinate
     system.
