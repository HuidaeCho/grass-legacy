v.proj <alpha>       GRASS Reference Manual        <alpha> v.proj



NAME
     v.proj - Allows projection conversion of vector files.

SYNOPSIS
     v.proj
     v.proj help
     v.proj map=name [out=name] inloc=name [dbase=name]
     [set=name]

DESCRIPTION
     allows a user to convert a vector map in a specified mapset
     of a specified location (different from current) with
     projection of input location to the vector map in a current
     mapset of current location with projection of current
     location (both projections are defined by corresponding
     PROJ_INFO files).

     v.proj will create dig, dig_att, and dig_cats directories in
     the output mapset, if they do NOT exist.  Map files for dig,
     dig_att, and dig_cats are also created for the new map
     layer.

     Parameters:

     map=name          Name of the input vector file.

     out=name          Name of the output vector file.

     inloc=name        Name of the location containing input
                       vector file

     dbase=name        Name of the database containing input
                       location

     set=name          Name of the mapset containing input vector
                       file

     If the user simply types v.proj without specifying parameter
     values on the command line, the program will prompt the user
     to enter these.

NOTES
     If out is not specified it is set to be the same as input
     map name.
     If dbase is not specified it is assumed to be the current
     database.
     If set is not specified, its name is assumed to be the same
     as the current
      mapset's name.
