NAME
     i.gensig - Generates statistics for i.maxlik from raster map
     layer.
     (GRASS Imagery Program)

SYNOPSIS
     i.gensig
     i.gensig help
     i.gensig trainingmap=name group=name subgroup=name
	signaturefile=name

DESCRIPTION
     i.gensig is a non-interactive method for generating input
     into i.maxlik.  It can be used as the first pass in the
     GRASS two-pass classification process (instead of i.cluster
     or i.class).  It reads a raster map layer, called the
     training map, which has some of the pixels or regions
     already classified.  i.gensig will then extract spectral
     signatures from an image based on the classification of the
     pixels in the training map and make these signatures
     available to i.maxlik.

     The user would then execute the GRASS program i.maxlik to
     actually create the final classified map.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters

     trainingmap
	  ground truth training map

	  This map must be prepared by the user in advance.
	  Programs like v.digit or r.digit  can be used to define
	  representative areas of the classes the user defines to
	  be in the image.  Of course other methods could be
	  devised by the user for creating this training map -
	  i.gensig makes no assumption about the origin of this
	  map layer. It simply creates signatures for the classes
	  defined in the training map for the image to be
	  classified (the image is specified in other options -
	  see below).


     group
	  imagery group

	  This is the name of the group that contains the band
	  files which comprise the image to be analyzed. The
	  i.group command is used to construct groups of raster
	  layers which comprise an image.

     subgroup
	  subgroup containing image files

	  This names the subgroup within the group that selects a
	  subset of the bands to be analyzed. The i.group command
	  is also used to prepare this subgroup.  The subgroup
	  mechanism allows the user to select a subset of all the
	  band files that form an image.


     signaturefile
	  resultant signature file

	  This is the resultant signature file (containing the
	  means and covariance matrices) for each class in the
	  training map that is associated with the band files in
	  the subgroup select (see above).

INTERACTIVE MODE
     If none of the arguments are specified on the command line,
     i.gensig will interactively prompt for the names of these
     maps and files.

     It should be noted that interactive mode here only means
     interactive prompting for maps and files.	It does not mean
     visualization of the signatures that result from the
     process.


SEE ALSO
     i.group for creating groups and subgroups.

     v.digit, r.digit for interactively	 creating the training
     map.

     i.cluster for unsupervised clustering as an alternative to
     i.gensig to create signatures.

     i.class for a graphic/interactive as an alternative to
     i.gensig to create signatures.
