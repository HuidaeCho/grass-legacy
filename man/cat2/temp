If the master binary vector  file  created  using  v.in.tiger  is
modified  after  it  is  in GRASS, this program will probably not
work.  In that situation, the processes from  this  shell  script
may simply be run by hand, using v.db.rim directly, but searching
the old vector file to  find  lines  for  the  new  vector  files
without using the binary offset field (vectoff).
