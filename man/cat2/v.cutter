NAME
     v.cutter - Polygon Cookie Cutter  (Boolean AND Overlay)
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.cutter
     v.cutter help
     v.cutter [-u] [-q] cutter=name data=name out=name

DESCRIPTION
     This program provides a way to generate new maps based on an
     intersection of two existing maps.	 It in effect provides a
     way to create masked versions of vector maps.  Both lines,
     sites, and polygons are clipped correctly.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     -q		       Run quietly.  Don't print percent
		       information.

     -u		       Intersect all areas even those that are
		       unlabeled. Not generally useful and also
		       not fully tested.

     cutter=mapname    Name of the binary vector file to use for
		       the cookie cutter.

     data=mapname      Name of the binary vector file which is to
		       be cut.

     out=mapname       Name of new vector file to be created.

NOTES
     The user must run v.spag -i after running v.cutter to remove
     identical lines.

     The polygons of the cutter map must be labeled to be
     effective unless the -u flag is specified.

     The attributes of created polygons will be generated from
     the attributes of the data map.

BUGS
     There are a few rare situations that are not currently
     handled correctly.	 These mostly involve nodes or vertices
     intersecting exactly with lines of the opposite map.  You
     will know you have hit one of these cases because a lot of
     strange text will start spitting out.

     Currently the program generates many duplicate lines.  So
     v.spag -i must be run on the new file to clean them up.  The

     -i flag specifies to only do the identical line removal
     phase and is a new option to v.spag in release 4.1.  Don't
     forget to use this flag, as it will run much faster, and
     will not make any other changes to your data.

     Borders between areas with the same attributes are not
     disolved.

     There is no fuzzy data handling code, so expect to see
     slivers.

     There are many places where the code could be optimized
     greatly.

NOTICE
     This program is part of the alpha section of the GRASS
     distribution.  Unlike the code in the main section of GRASS,
     the alpha code has not yet been fully tested for one release
     cycle.
