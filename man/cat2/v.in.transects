NAME
     v.in.transects - import transect data to a GRASS vector map
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.in.transects
     v.in.transects help
     v.in.transects [-a] input=name [fs=character"] length=value
	[units=name] [decl=name] vect=name [title=name"]

DESCRIPTION
     v.in.transects imports "transects" into a GRASS vector map.
     A transect is a line (or an area) which is described by a
     starting coordinate, a direction or azimuth, (or backward,
     forward, rightside, and leftside distances from the line
     transect), and a length (in meters or feet). The information
     describing the transects must be in a file prepared by the
     user before running v.in.transects.  The format of this file
     is described below in the section TRANSECT FILE FORMAT .


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flag:

     -a		       Run for area transects. Default is line
		       transects, i.e., this flag is not used.


     Parameters:

     input	       transect information file

		       This is the file containing the transect
		       information to be imported.  The format of
		       this file is described below in the
		       section TRANSECT FILE FORMAT

     fs		       input data field separator

		       The transect file is organized one
		       transect per line with at least 4 fields.
		       The fs option specifies the character that
		       is used in the transect information file
		       to separate the fields. If not specified,
		       fields are assumed to be separated by
		       blanks (white space). (Quote the delimeter
		       whenever you are not sure whether it has
		       special meaning in UNIX or not, to avoid
		       the misunderstanding by GRASS.)

     length	       transect length

v.in.transects <alpha>GRASS Reference Manua<alpha> v.in.transects



		       This is the length of the transects
		       (default is in grid units, e.g., meters).
		       It is assumed that all transects have the
		       same length. If they do not, then more
		       than one import process must be run to
		       create two or more vector files and the
		       results patched together (using v.patch).

     units	       units of the length
		       default: meter

		       This is the unit of the transect. It can
		       be meter or foot.


     decl	       declination - angle (in degrees) to be
		       added to input azimuth angles
		       default: 0

		       Each transect has a direction or azimuth
		       angle associated with it. The map
		       projection may have a declination
		       associated with it and if the azimuth
		       angles embedded in the transect input file
		       do not account for this declination, it
		       may be specified here.

     vect	       Vector map to be created

     title	       Title for resultant vector map
		       default: Transect map

		       If title is more than one word, it should
		       always be quoted.


TRANSECT FILE FORMAT
     The format for the transect file consists of one record or
     line per transect with 4 mandatory fields and a 5th optional
     field for line transects. The first field is the GRASS
     category number to be assigned to the transect.  The second
     and third fields are the easting and northing (respectively)
     of the starting coordinate for the transect.  The fourth
     field is the azimuth in degrees clockwise from north of the
     transect.	Following the fourth field is an optional fifth
     field that is the category label for the transect. The
     following is a simple example with 3 transects:

      1	  709818   5453991   246.0   P CLGR 4 73 1 21 0 0 0 0 1
      2	  698350   5464162   128.0   P CLGR 0 55 0 36 0 0 0 0 1
      3	  704615   5461874   190.5   P DEGR 0 34 4 15 0 0 0 0 0

     Note that the fifth field (i.e., the label) is really
     everything after the azimuth, not just the P.

     This file could be formatted as follows:

	  1:709818:5453991:246.0:P:CLGR:4:73:1:21:0:0:0:0:1
	  2:698350:5464162:128.0:P:CLGR:0:55:0:36:0:0:0:0:1
	  3:704615:5461874:190.5:P:DEGR:0:34:4:15:0:0:0:0:0

     In this case the fields are separated by a colon so fs=:
     must be specified on the command line. The labels (starting
     with the P) would retain the colons (i.e., they are not
     removed from the label even though they act to define the
     first 4 fields).


     When area transects are required, the transects file should
     include four (4) more fields for backward, forward,
     rightside, and leftside distance from the corresponding line
     transect. The format will be as the following:

1   709818   5453991   246.0   10.0   15.0   20.0    5.0   P CLGR 4 73 1 21 0 0 0 0 1
2   698350   5464162   128.0	5.0   15.0   10.0   25.0   P CLGR 0 55 0 36 0 0 0 0 1
3   704615   5461874   190.5   15.0   20.0   10.0    5.0   P DEGR 0 34 4 15 0 0 0 0 0

     Note that delimiter could be other than white space in
     transect file. Vector files of line transects can be
     generated from the above area transects file by not using -a
     flag. However, the label will include four (4) more items.



NOTES
     The resulting vector map is a complete GRASS vector map: it
     will have a category file with the labels from the input
     file and it will have the topology file already built.
     (v.support is run automatically by v.in.transects as the
     final step in creating the GRASS vector map.)
