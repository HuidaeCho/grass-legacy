NAME
     r.in.ll - Converts	raster data referenced using latitude and
     longitude coordinates to a	latitude-longitude-referenced or
     a UTM-referenced map layer	in GRASS raster	format.
     (GRASS Raster Data	Import Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.in.ll
     r.in.ll help
     r.in.ll [-l] [-s] input=name output=name bpc=value
	corner=corner,lat,lon dimension=rows,cols
	res=latres,lonres [spheroid=name]

DESCRIPTION
     This program converts raster data referenced using	 latitude
     and longitude coordinates to a latitude-longitude-referenced
     or	a  UTM-referenced  map	layer  in  GRASS  raster  format.
     r.in.ll is	primarily used as the final program in converting
     DTED and DEM digital elevation data to GRASS raster  format,
     but  is  not  limited  to this use.  r.in.ll uses the user's
     current geographic	region settings.  Only	data  that  falls
     within  the  current  geographic  region  will appear in the
     final raster map layer.

     r.in.ll flag settings  and	 parameters  have  the	following
     meanings  (only  the  spheroid  parameter	is  optional,  as
     explained):


COMMAND	LINE OPTIONS
     Flags:

     -l		       Create  a  latitude-longitude   referenced
		       raster	 (not	UTM).	 This	flag   is
		       incompatible  with  use	of  the	 spheroid
		       parameter.

     -s		       Signed  data  (high  bit	 means	 negative
		       value).


     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name  of	 an  existing  input  raster  map
		       layer.

     output=name       Name to be assigned to the  output  raster
		       map layer.

     bpc=value	       Number of bytes per cell.

		       One corner latitude and longitude  of  the
		       input.
		       Format:
		       {nw|ne|sw|se},dd:mm:ss{N|S},ddd:mm:ss{E|W}

		       The latitude and	longitude  are	specified
		       as  dd.mm.ssH  where  dd	is degrees, mm is
		       minutes,	ss  is	seconds,  and  H  is  the
		       hemisphere  (N  or S for	latitudes, E or	W
		       for longitudes).

		       For  example,  to  specify  the	southwest
		       corner:	corner=sw,46N,120W

		       Note:	the   latitude	 and	longitude
		       specified are for the center of the corner
		       cell.

     dimension=rows,cols
		       Number of rows and columns  in  the  input
		       file.

     res=latres,lonres Resolution of the input (in arc seconds).

     spheroid=name     Name of spheroid	to be used for coordinate
		       conversion   (If	  the  -l  flag	 is  set,
		       specification  of  this	 parameter   will
		       result in an error.  If the -l flag is not
		       set, the	spheroid type must be entered.)
		       Options:	   airy,   australian,	  bessel,
		       clark66,	   everest,    grs80,	 hayford,
		       international,  krasovsky,  wgs66,  wgs72,
		       wgs84

EXAMPLE
     The command line:

	  r.in.ll input=rot.out	output=import.out
	     dimension=358,301 bpc=2 res=3,3
	     corner=sw,37:13N,103:45W spheroid=wgs72

     reads data	from the file rot.out,	converts  the  data,  and
     stores  them  in  the  file  import.out.	The  data  to  be
     converted are made	up of 358 rows and 301 columns,	and  have
     a resolution of 3x3 arc seconds.

NOTES
     In	the conversion of DTED and DEM elevation data  to  raster
     map  layer	 format,  r.in.ll  follows  execution of the data
     rotation  program	m.rot90.   Because  the	 user  can  glean
     information   on	the  number  of	 rows  and  columns,  the
     resolutions of the	latitude and longitude,	and the	number of

     bytes  per	 column	from the header	file produced by the tape
     extraction	programs m.dted.extract	 and  m.dmaUSGSread,  the
     user  should  recall  that	 m.rot90  has  rotated	the files
     produced by the tape extraction programs  90  degrees;  this
     means  that  the user should INTERCHANGE the numbers of rows
     and columns present in the	header file for	input to r.in.ll.
     The number	of rows	shown in the tape extract header file now
     become the	number of columns in  the  m.rot90  output  file;
     the  number of columns shown in the tape extract header file
     are now the number	of rows	present	 in  the  m.rot90  output
     file.

     The user should also note that the	raster map layer imported
     into  GRASS  will	be based on the	current	geographic region
     settings.	The boundaries of this geographic  region  should
     therefore	be checked before importing the	raster map layer.
     Data outside of the geographic region will	not  be	 imported
     and  missing  data	 will  be assigned the category	value "no
     data".

WARNING
     The  original  code  for  r.in.ll	was  written   prior   to
     implementation   of   support   for  the  latitude-longitude
     projection.  In  this  code,  eastern  hemisphere	longitude
     values  are  negative,  the  opposite  of	the  contemporary
     convention.  Some kludges were  used  to  add  the	 facility
     offered by	use of the -l flag.

NOTICE
     This program is part of  the  alpha  section  of  the  GRASS
     distribution.  Unlike the code in the main	section	of GRASS,
     the alpha code has	not yet	been fully tested for one release
     cycle.
