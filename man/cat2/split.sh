NAME
     split.sh - Divides the graphics monitor into two frames and
     then displays two maps in these frames.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     split.sh mapname mapname [cmd=GRASS_command]
     [cmd2=GRASS_command] [view=horiz]

DESCRIPTION
     split.sh is a Bourne shell (sh(1)) script that clears the
     entire graphics screen and divides it into two display
     frames.  Map layers are then displayed in each of the two
     frames.  This command is very useful for visually comparing
     maps (raster, vector, and 3-d views) and can be used by
     other GRASS shell macros.  It is also useful for creating
     demos.  Program parameters are given below.

     Parameters:

     view=horiz        The graphics screen can be split either
                       horizontally or vertically.  The default
                       view splits the screen into two frames,
                       one on the left and one on the right (a
                       vertical split).  Some maps ( 3-d views)
                       are better represented with more width
                       then height (horizontal split).  The first
                       map name listed on the command line will
                       be displayed in the top or left window
                       (depending on whether the screen was split
                       horizontally or vertically), and The
                       second map will be displayed in the bottom
                       or right window.

     cmd=GRASS_command The GRASS command used to display the
                       named mapnames.  If no command is
                       specified by the user, d.rast is used by
                       default.  However, any GRASS display
                       command (e.g., d.3d, d.vect, etc...) can
                       be entered.

     cmd2=GRASS_command
                       This command will be used to display map
                       data in the second frame only.

                       If the user fails to specify the values of
                       both cmd and cmd2fR, split.sh will use the
                       default command (d.rast) to display user-
                       specified map layer names in both frames.
                       If the user specifies only the value of
                       cmd on the command line, then that command
                       will be executed for both frames.  If the

                       user specifies the values of both cmd and
                       cmd2 on the command line, the cmd command
                       will be executed in frame 1 and the cmd2
                       command will be executed in frame 2.

EXAMPLES
     split.sh  soils  vegcover

     split.sh  soils  cmd2=d.legend "soils red"

     split.sh  elevation  vegcover  cmd=d.3d  view=horiz

NOTES
     split.sh leaves the frame that the last map was drawn in as
     the active frame.  The order in which the options (cmd,
     cmd2, view) are placed on the command line doesn't matter,
     but the order is important for the map names.

FILES
     This program is simply a shell script.  Users are encouraged
     to make their own shell scripts using similar techniques.
