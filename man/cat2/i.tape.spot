NAME
     i.tape.spot - An imagery function that extracts SPOT imagery
     from half-inch tape.
     (GRASS Image Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     i.tape.spot

DESCRIPTION
     i.tape.spot is a program that extracts SPOT imagery from 9-
     track, half-inch tape.

     This program must be run in a LOCATION_NAME with an x,y
     coordinate system (i.e., a coordinate system with projection
     0).  For further information regarding this LOCATION_NAME
     type refer to the imagery manual entry.

     The first prompt in i.tape.spot asks the user for the tape
     device name.

     Enter tape device name:


     This is sometimes  /dev/rmt0 (for a half-inch tape having a
     density of 1600 bpi), but this varies with each machine.

     The next prompt is:

     Mount SPOT tape and  hit RETURN -->


IMAGE IDENTIFICATION MENU
     The first menu in the program asks the user for information
     about the data.

               Please enter the following information

         TAPE IDENTIFICATION:                             __

         IMAGE DESCRIPTION:                               __

         TITLE FOR THE EXTRACTED CELL (RASTER) FILES:     __

     This program automatically reads the satellite name, tape
     product code, instrument name, interleaving indicator,
     spectral mode, preprocessing level and work order number
     into the field for TAPE IDENTIFICATION.  The mission, path,
     row, scene shift, scene center date and time, orientation,

     incidence, azimuth, elevation angle, and absolute
     calibration coefficients and offsets are automatically
     entered into the field for IMAGE DESCRIPTION.  User can type
     in any other messages into the two sections and a
     description as the title of raster map layer.  The second
     menu is:

                          SPOT IMAGE EXTRACT
             Please select region of the image to extract

                      start row: 0______(1-3002)
                        end row: 0______(1-3002)

                      start col: 0______(1-3166)
                        end col: 0______(1-3166)


         AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                       (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

     The numbers in parentheses are the total number of rows and
     columns on the tape including zeros (filler).  This
     information and additional information can also be obtained
     by running the program m.examine.tape.  m.examine.tape will
     read any tape and provide the user with the number of files
     on a tape, the number of records on a tape, and the record
     lengths.  Any subset of the image on the tape may be
     extracted.  For a discussion of row and column extraction
     see the subheading entitled ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION below.

     The next menu is:

           Please mark an x by the bands you want extracted

                               _____ 1
                               _____ 2
                               _____ 3

         AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                       (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

     SPOT imagery has three bands, but the user may want to
     extract a subset of these bands.  See the subheading in this
     entry entitled ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION.

     The user then is asked to enter the prefix/group name for
     the raster band files to be created.  This name will precede
     each band file extracted into GRASS.  For example, if two
     bands are extracted the following two band files will
     result:

                          prefixname.1



GRASS 4.1                U.S. Army CERL                         2






i.tape.spot <alpha>  GRASS Reference Manual   <alpha> i.tape.spot



                          prefixname.2

     The specified prefixname will also automatically become the
     name for the imagery group file being created.  Each image
     or subset (i.e., each run of i.tape.spot) should be given a
     unique prefix/group name.

     The extraction process will begin by first skipping a number
     of files which are not data or not requested, advancing to
     the first band requested, forwarding to the requested
     column, and then reading the data.  After extracting the
     requested rows and columns from each band, the program
     creates support files for the raster band map layer.  The
     percent completion of the extraction is displayed on the
     screen.  Because sometimes SPOT imagery is very large and is
     stored in multiple tape sets, the program is designed to
     read image by pausing when the tape need to be changed and
     inform the user to mount and load next tape. The number of
     tapes required to store one scene depends on the number of
     bytes per inch (bpi) in which the data are stored.

     The extracted band files will be listed as raster map layers
     available in the current MAPSET and may be displayed using
     the GRASS commands d.display, d.rast, or i.points.

ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION
     The display options in GRASS allow the user to locate rows
     and columns on the digital image.  If enough disk space is
     available, one band of an entire image or one band of a
     portion of an image known to contain the area of interest,
     can be extracted and displayed.  The measurements option in
     d.display, or d.where (following use of d.rast) will echo x
     and y coordinates to the screen.  (These coordinates will
     display negative numbers in the north-south direction, but
     ignoring the negative sign will yield the row number.)  See
     the imagery manual entry for further explanation.

     Each scene of a SPOT image contains filler on both the left
     and right sides of the quad.  The user may want to identify
     the row and column numbers in order to exclude the filler.
     This filler will otherwise be extracted with the image and
     take up unnecessary disk space.

     If a photograph of the digital image is available, the rows
     and columns to be extracted can be determined from it by
     associating inches with the total number of known rows and
     columns in the scene.  For example, if the total length of
     the photograph is 12 inches, the total number of rows on the
     tape is 2000, and the northwest corner of the area of
     interest begins 2 inches from the top of the photo, then:

                    12" / 2000 rows = 2" / x rows

i.tape.spot <alpha>  GRASS Reference Manual   <alpha> i.tape.spot



                             x = 333.333

     The northwest corner of the area of interest starts at row
     333.  The starting row, ending row, starting column, and
     ending column can be calculated in this manner.

NOTES
     After extracting an image from tape the geographic region
     definition in the x,y coordinate LOCATION_NAME will be set
     based upon the extracted rows and columns from the tape.
     The relationship between the image rows and columns and the
     coordinates of the geographic region is discussed in the
     imagery format manual entry.

     This program is interactive and requires no command line
     arguments.
