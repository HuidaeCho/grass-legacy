NAME
     r.surf.contour - Surface generation program.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.surf.contour
     r.surf.contour help
     r.surf.contour [-f] input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     r.surf.contour creates a raster elevation map from a
     rasterized contour map.  Elevation values are determined
     using procedures similar to a manual methods.  To determine
     the elevation of a point on a contour map, an individual
     might interpolate its value from those of the two nearest
     contour lines (uphill and downhill).

     r.surf.contour works in a similar way.  Initially, a vector
     map of the contour lines is made with the elevation of each
     line as its label (see v.digit).  When the program v.to.rast
     is run on the vector map, continuous "lines" of rasters
     containing the contour line values will be the input for
     r.surf.contour.  For each cell in the input map, either the
     cell is a contour line cell (which is given that value), or
     a flood fill is generated from that spot until the fill
     comes to two unique values.  The flood fill is not allowed
     to cross over the rasterized contour lines, thus ensuring
     that an uphill and downhill contour value will be the two
     values chosen.  r.surf.contour interpolates from the uphill
     and downhill values by the true distance.

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies the program parameter values and desired flag
     settings on the command line, using the form:

	  r.surf.contour [-f] input=name output=name

     Alternately, the user can simply type r.surf.contour on the
     command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for needed inputs and option choices
     using the standard GRASS user interface described in the
     manual entry for parser.


     Flag:

     -f		       Invoke fast, but memory-intensive program
		       operation.

     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of an existing raster map layer that

		       contains a set of initial category values
		       (i.e., some cells contain known category
		       values (denoting contours) while the rest
		       contain zeros (0)).

     output=name       Name to be assigned to new output raster
		       map layer that represents a smooth (e.g.,
		       elevation) surface generated from the
		       known category values in the input raster
		       map layer.

NOTES
     r.surf.contour works well under the following circumstances:
     1) the contour lines extend to the the edge of the current
     region, 2) the program is run at the same resolution as that
     of the input map, 3) there are no disjointed contour lines,
     and 4) no spot elevation data BETWEEN contour lines exist.
     Spot elevations at the tops of hills and the bottoms of
     depressions, on the other hand, improve the output greatly.
     Violating these constraints will cause non-intuitive
     anomalies to appear in the output map.  Run r.slope.aspect
     on r.surf.contour results to locate potential anomalies.

     The running of r.surf.contour is very sensitive to the
     resolution of rasterized vector map.  If multiple contour
     lines go through the same raster, slight anomalies may
     occur.  The speed of r.surf.contour is dependent on how far
     "apart" the contour lines are from each other (as measured
     in rasters).  Since a flood fill algorithm is used, the
     program's running time will grow exponentially with the
     distance between contour lines.
