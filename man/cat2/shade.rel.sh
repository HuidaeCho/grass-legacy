NAME
     shade.rel.sh - Creates a shaded relief map based on current
     resolution settings and sun altitude and azimuth values
     entered by the user.
     (GRASS Shell Script)

SYNOPSIS
     shade.rel.sh

DESCRIPTION
     shade.rel.sh is a Bourne shell (sh(1)) script that creates a
     raster shaded relief map based on current resolution
     settings and on sun altitude and azimuth values entered by
     the user.  The new shaded relief map map is named shade and
     stored in the user's current mapset.  The map is assigned a
     grey-scale color table.

     This program is interactive;  the user enters the command:

          shade.rel.sh

     The program then prompts the user to enter values for:
          (1)  the altitude of the sun in degrees above the
          horizon (a value between 0 and 90 degrees), and
          (2)  the azimuth of the sun in degrees to the east of
          north (a value between -1 and 360 degrees).
          (3)  the name of a raster map layer whose cell category
          values are to provide elevation values for the shaded
          relief map.  Typically, this would be a map layer of
          elevation;  however, any raster map layer can be named.

     Specifically, shade.rel.sh executes the following r.mapcalc
     statement:

          r.mapcalc << EOF
          shade = eval( \
           x=($elev[-1,-1] + 2*$elev[0,-1] + $elev[1,-1] \
             -$elev[-1,1] - 2*$elev[0,1] - $elev[1,1])/(8.*$ewres) , \
           y=($elev[-1,-1] + 2*$elev[-1,0] + $elev[-1,1] \
             -$elev[1,-1] - 2*$elev[1,0] - $elev[1,1])/(8.*$nsres) , \
           slope=90.-atan(sqrt(x*x + y*y)), \
           a=round(atan(x,y)), \
           aspect=if(x||y,if(a,a,360)), \
           cang = sin($alt)*sin(slope) + cos($alt)*cos(slope) * cos($az-aspect), \
           if(cang < 0,0,100*cang))
          EOF

     Refer to the manual entry for r.mapcalc for an explanation
     of the filtering syntax shown in the above expression.  See,
     for example, the section on "The Neighborhood Modifier".

     shade.rel.sh then runs r.colors to assign a grey-scale color
     table to the new shaded relief map shade, by executing the
     command:

          r.colors shade color=grey

FILES
     This program is simply a shell script.  Users are encouraged
     to make their own shell scripts using similar techniques.
