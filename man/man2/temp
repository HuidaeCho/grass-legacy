If the master binary vector file created using \fIv.in.tiger\fR is
modified after it is in GRASS, this program will probably not work.
In that situation, the processes from this shell script may simply
be run by hand, using \fIv.db.rim\fR directly, but searching the 
old vector file to find lines for the new vector files without
using the binary offset field (vectoff).
