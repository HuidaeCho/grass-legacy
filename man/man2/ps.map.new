\fBps.map.new help\fR
.br
\fBps.map.new\fR [\fB\-r\fR] [\fBinput=\fR\fIname\fR] [\fBscale=\fR\fImapscale\fR] [\fBcopies=\fR\fIn\fR] \fBoutput=\fR\fIname\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIps.map.new\fR
produces an output file containing a PostScript program to
produce hardcopy map products on your system's PostScript output
device.  Output can include a raster map, any number of vector overlays,
site data, text labels, and other spatial data.
.PP
This program has 2 distincts modes of operation.  The command-line
mode requires the user to prepare a file of mapping instructions describing
the various spatial and textual information to be printed prior to running
\fIps.map.new\fR.
The interactive mode (i.e., no command-line arguments) will prompt the
user for items to be mapped and does not require the user
to prepare a file of instructions (some options are not used
in interactive mode).
.PP
The command line flag is:
.LI "\fB-r\fR 
Rotate plot 90 degrees.
.PP
.PP
The command-line parameters are:
.LI "\fBinput=\fR\fIname\fR 
File containing mapping instructions.
(or enter \fBinput=-\fR to enter from keyboard).
These instructions are described in detail below.
.LI "\fBscale=\fR\fImapscale\fR 
Scale of the output map,  e.g. 1:25000
.br
Default:  1 panel
.PP
This parameter is provided as a convenience.  It is identical to the 
\fIscale\fR
mapping instruction described below.
.LI "\fBoutput=\fR\fIname\fR 
Name of output the file to contain the PostScript program.
.PP
.PP
Note: the user must select a PostScript output device using
\fI
\*Lps.select\*O
\fR
before running \fIps.map.new\fR.
.PP
.SH MAPPING INSTRUCTIONS
The mapping instructions allow the user to specify various spatial data
to be plotted. These instructions are normally prepared in a regular
text file using a system editor.
Some instructions are single line instructions while
others are multiple line. Multiple line instructions consist of
the main instruction followed by a subsection of one or more additional
instructions.
.PP
Instructions that may be included in the subsection under several
different main instructions are:
.LI "\fBwhere\ \fR\fIx\ y\fR 
The top left corner of the bounding box of the item to be plotted
is located \fIx\fR inches from the left edge of the paper and
\fIy\fR inches from the top edge of the paper. If \fIx\fR is less than
or equal to zero, the default horizontal location is used.  If \fIy\fR
is less than or equal to zero, the default vertical location is used.
.LI "\fBfont\ \fR\fIfont\ name\fR 
The name of the PostScript font.  The default is \fIHelvetica\fR.
.LI "\fBfontsize\ \fR\fIfont\ size\fR 
The size of the PostScript font in 1/72 inch.  The default is 10.
.PP
.SH colortable
Prints the color table for the raster map layer anywhere on the page.

USAGE:	\fBcolortable\fR [y|n]

	\fBfont\fR font name
	\fBfontsize\fR font size
	\fBcolor\fR text color
	\fBend\fR
.TE
\*O
The color table will display the colors for each raster map layer
category value and the category label.
To get a color table, you must have previously requested a raster
map layer.
The default location for the colortable is immediately below any other
map legend information, starting at the left margin.
The default text color is black.
Omitting the \fBcolortable\fR instruction would result in
no color table.  \fBNote\fR:  Be careful about asking for color tables for
raster map layers which have many categories, such as elevation.
This could result in the printing of an extremely long color table!!!!!
.PP
This example would print a color table immediately below any other map legend
information, starting at the left margin.

The \fBspacing\fR of the grid is given (in the geographic coordinate
system units) on the main instruction line.  The subsection instructions
allow the user to specify
the \fBcolor\fR of the grid lines,
whether coordinate \fBnumbers\fR should appear
on the grid lines, and
if they
should appear every grid line (1), every other grid line 
(2), etc., and what color the numbers should be.  The defaults are
black grid lines, unnumbered.
.PP
This example would overlay a green grid with a spacing of 10000 meters
(for a metered database, like UTM) onto the output map.  Alternate grid
lines would be numbered with red numbers.

by using percentages of the geographic region.
The user may also specify line
\fBcolor\fR,
\fBwidth\fR

and if the line is to be
\fBmasked\fR
by the current mask. (See manual entry for \fI

If \fIwidth\fR and \fIheight\fR (in inches) are present, the map will be

Distinct areas of the raster map will be separated from each other visually
by drawing a border (or outline) in the specified
\fBcolor\fR

\fBwidth\fR
the program accepts decimal points [floating points] as well as integers.
Note: it is
important the user enter the instruction \fBend\fR even if a color is not
chosen.
(It is hoped that in the future the outline of a different raster map
layer other than the one currently being painted may be placed on the map.)

The user may also specify the point

the \fBicon\fR file to be used to represent the point location

by the current mask. (See manual entry for \fI

This example would place a purple diamond (from icon file

This example reads the UNIX file \fIpmap.roads\fR into \fIps.map.new\fR.

The user may have created this file because this vector map layer
is particularly useful for many \fIps.map.new\fR

The user can specify the \fBcolor\fR

The default is a black border of one pixel width.

\fBhcolor\fR - the highlight color for the vector lines;
.PP
\fBhwidth\fR - the width of the highlight color in pixels;
.PP
\fBoffset\fR (experimental) - offset for the vectors lines in pixels for plotting
parallel lines in distance equal to offset (accepts positive or 
negative decimal points);
.PP
\fBcoffset\fR (experimental) - offset for the vectors lines. If coffset is used then 
offset of line is equal to coffset * category value and offset is 
used in legend;
.PP
\fBref\fR (experimental) - line justification. 
.PP
\fBmasked\fR - whether or not the raster map layer is to be masked
by the current mask 
(see manual entry \fI
\*Lr.mask\*O
\fR for more information on the mask);
.PP
\fBstyle\fR - the line style allows the vectors
to be dashed in different patterns.  This is done by typing a
series of numbers (0's and 1's) in a desired sequence or pattern.
Blanks and
non-digit characters are recognized as 0's. Using 0 would allow the
colors of the raster map layer (or the background color
if no raster map layer was selected) to show through;
.PP
\fBline_cat\fR - which category should be plotted (default is all);
.PP
\fBlabel\fR - for description in vlegend. Default is: 
map(mapset);
.PP
\fBlpos\fR - position vector is plotted in legend. If lpos is
0 then this vector is omitted in legend. If more vectors used the 
same lpos then their symbols in legend are merged and label for
first vector is used.
.PP
.PP
This example would paint a map of the vector map layer
named \fIstreams\fR.
These streams would be a total of 3 pixels wide (the inner two pixels blue and
the outer highlight pixel white).  The map would not show streams outside of the
current mask. Only streams of category 2 will be plotted.
In legend appeares label 'Streams - category 2'.

The default location is immediately below the legend containing the
scale, grid and region information,
starting at the left edge of the map.
If the \fIwhere\fR instruction is present and \fIy\fR is less than or
equal to zero, the vector legend will be positioned immediately below
the map, starting \fIx\fR inches from the left edge of the page.
