.SH DESCRIPTION
This program creates a GRASS vector map in the current mapset (UTM or
Lat-Long locations only) with labelled line segments constructed from
the end points (nodes) from the Type 1 TIGER file records and shape
points from the Type 2 TIGER file.  The nodes and shape points are
matched by the TIGER record number (TLID field).  In the attribute
(label) file which is built (in the \fIdig_att\fR directory), the
lines are given the "area boundary" type and line labels are the
record numbers (9 digits!).

The Type 1 file may contain the records for a complete county, a subset
for a county, or those from more than one county concatenated.  The
Type 2 file must contain all those records corresponding to the Type 1
records, but may contain extra records which will not be used.
Typically, a subset of Type 1 records is used and a full county Type 2
file is used.

The program should function well independent of the termination 
character(s) at the end of each line in the input files.  <LF>,
<CR>, neither, one, or both are acceptable.  Different distribution 
media apparently have different record delimiting characters.

The -p flag should not normally be used.  It causes the program
to build a disk file pointer table for all of the Type 2
records each time the program runs, rather than using the table
built previously.  Detection, naming and verification of the
pointer file are automatic.  It is created in the "tmp" space in
the user's location.

.SH THE tlid PARAMETER
The file specified by the \fItlid\fR parameter may be of any size.
Any number at the beginning of a line will be interpreted to be the
TLID of a Type 1 record which is to be included in the output map.
Other information on these lines is ignored, as are lines which do
not begin with a number.  If fewer than 5000 numbers are in this
file, it is only read once and execution speed is greatly enhanced.
Normally, a full Type 1 file will be specified by the \fIt1\fR
parameter when a \fItlid\fR file is used.


.SH BUGS/RESTRICTIONS
\fBCaution:\fR This program will overwrite an existing vector map of
the same name without warning.

The Type 2 input file must be on a device capable of "seeking," i.e.,
not a tape drive. CD-ROM is OK (but program will run much faster
from disk files).

Input lines in a \fItlid\fR file are limited to 300 characters in
length.  If the system can allocate space to store all the TLID numbers
read from this file, it is only read once and execution speed is
greatly enhanced; on a typical system, space for more than 10,000
numbers can be allocated.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBv.apply.census\fR will generate polygon labels for Census
tracts, block groups, etc., from STF1 or PL94-171 files.
.br
\fBm.in.stf1.tape\fR and/or unix text tools can be used to
extract/concatenate useful subsets of TIGER Type 1 records prior
to running \fBv.in.tig.basic\fR.
