.SH NAME
\*Lr.water.fea\*O  - Finite element analysis program for
hydrologic simulations.
.PP
(GRASS Raster Program)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\*Lr.water.fea\*O
.br
.PP
.SH OVERVIEW
\*Lr.water.fea\*O is an interactive program that allows the user to simulate 
storm water runoff analysis using the finite element numerical technique.
Infiltration is calculated using the Green and Ampt formulation. \*Lr.water.fea\*O computes and draws hydrographs for every basin as well as at stream 
junctions in an analysis area. It also draws animation maps at the basin level.  
.PP
.SH DATA REQUIREMENTS
The maps required by \*Lr.water.fea\*O  are:
.PP
1) Basin map
.br
2) Stream map
.br
3) Drainage map
.br
4) Accumulation map
.br
5) Slope map
.PP
The other data requirements of \*Lr.water.fea\*O are the parameters needed to 
calculate infiltration and the channel roughness parameter. Model parameters 
may be provided either in the form of maps or as values:
.PP
1) Manning roughness coefficient map or basin value
.br
2) Saturated hydraulic conductivity map or basin value
.br
3) Suction head at wetting front map or basin value
.br
4) Effective porosity map or basin value
.br
5) Degree of saturation basin value
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
On running \*Lr.water.fea\*O for the first time, the directory 
"r.water.fea"
is created under $LOCATION. When the user runs \*Lr.water.fea\*O, the program 
will prompt the user for the project name. The project name refers to the 
directory that is created under the 
"r.water.fea"
directory. All files (not maps) related to the analysis carried out by 
\*Lr.water.fea\*O are stored under this directory. If the project does not 
exist then the user is further requested for the input maps. If the project 
already exists, then the program looks for the proper project related files to 
proceed with stopped work. 
.PP
\*LConfiguration\*O
.PP
The user is  asked for the following  configuration modes:
I) Rainfall mode: The rainfall mode is defined as follows:
.PP
1 = spatially uniform and constant in time 
.br
2 = spatially uniform but varying in time 
.PP
If the user decides to use mode 2, then a mechanism is provided to 
allow creation of a rainfall rate file (described in step 4).
.PP
II) Basin-level hydrographs: This configuration mode allows the user to view 
intermediate hydrographs for every basin. The hydrographs will be displayed on
the graphics monitor. Each basin is considered to be independent of every other
basin in the analysis area.
.PP
III) Basin-level animation maps: This configuration mode allows the user to 
create time-series maps for later animation of flow depth for all the basins 
that have been analyzed. All animation maps use a multiplication factor of 1000.
The map cell value divided by the multiplication factor yields the actual 
value of flow depth in meters. The user will require enough file space in 
the GRASS database for this configuration. All animation map names have 
the following naming scheme:
.PP
fea..#
.PP
Here '#' represents the time step. One time step refers to 1/40th of the total
monitoring time. Twenty maps are created at every other time step.
.PP
\*LProgram flow\*O
.PP
The basin and stream maps are displayed on the monitor when the user starts
working on a project. The entire analysis is divided into a number of steps.
The user is presented with a menu to proceed through the set of steps to 
facilitate easy changes to the simulation for a given analysis area or to stop 
analysis between menu steps and continue at a more convenient time.
.PP
The main menu is shown below:
.PP
.PP
Choose from the menu:
.PP
.PP
*   1. Process steps without breaks.
.br
*->  2. Select basins for simulation.
.br
X   3. Extract topographical data.
.br
X   4. Select hydraulic parameters and simulation time.
.br
X   5. Basin simulation.
.br
X   6. Simulate any particular basin.
.br
X   7. Channel routing of basin hydrographs.
.br
*   8. Stop.
.PP
.PP
You are starting from the beginning.
.PP
Choice:
.PP
The "X", "*", and "*->" above have the following meaning.
.PP
.VL 4m
.LI "* 8
The user can select this part from the menu.
.br
.LI "*-> 8
This is the step that the user must select in order to
proceed in a sequence.
.br
.LI "X 8
The user can not select these parts of the menu (until previous steps have been
executed).
.PP
.PP
Throughout the program the symbols described above change as the user moves
from step to step.  The message just above the Choice prompt signals the status of the program, and guides the user as to what should be the next step.
.PP
.PP
.LI ""1. Process steps without breaks." 8
This  part of the menu will not prompt for steps 2-5, 7 and will carry out 
all the analysis. The user will find it advantageous to use this step when 
analyzing a small area or a few basins.
.PP
.LI ""2. Select basins for simulation." 8
This part of the menu draws the basin and stream maps for the user to select
the area of analysis. The mouse is then activated to provide a point and click
environment for the user to select basins in the area of analysis. Upon
successfully selecting the basins the user is given the choice of deleting
basins from the selected area. The basin topology is then determined and 
information on basin statistics is gathered. The information on connectivity
between basins is stored in the
"input.basin"
file and the information on basin statistics is stored in the 
"basin_info"
file. Two reclass maps describing the analysis area are also created. The maps 
have the following naming scheme:
.PP
"
.br
"
.PP
The user should avoid using these names to create other maps. Once these maps
are created the user should not destroy them, if the user wishes to continue 
working on the project.
.PP
.LI ""3. Extract topographical data." 8
This part of the menu generates information about the connectivity between 
cells and boundary conditions. This information is stored in the 
"input.file"
file in the project directory.  If the animation configuration has been set 
then another file called 
"coordinates"
is created in the project directory. This file contains information on the 
coordinates of every cell in the analysis area.
.PP
.PP
.LI ""4. Select hydraulic parameters and simulation time." 8
This part of the menu carries out two tasks. The first task involves querying
the user for simulation parameters. The simulation parameters include duration
of rainfall, maximum intensity, time step for simulation, monitoring time and
names of simulation maps if any. The second task involves querying channel
characteristics assuming the channels as trapezoidal cross-sections.  
The user is required to provide channel side slope, channel bottom width and 
the channel roughness coefficient values for every stream category.
.PP
The program creates a file 
"timedata"
in the project directory to store information from this part of the menu. If 
the user has selected the "Spatially uniform and time varying rainfall" mode 
(mode = 2), then the user is queried for the the name of a time file. If the 
file does not exist then a screen like the one shown below appears:

It is important to note  that the values in the time column should be in an 
increasing order. It is also not necessary to fill all the rows and the 
user can stop after filling only a few rows. The number of lines are 
limited to fifteen. If more than fifteen lines are required then the user 
will have to create the file using an editor. In that case the user should 
just type the time since commencement of rainfall (minutes) in the first 
column followed by the rainfall intensity (cm/hr) in the second column as

.LI ""5. Basin simulation." 8
This part of the menu carries out the simulation for each basin in the area
of analysis. Every basin is analyzed as independent of every other basin.
The user is shown the independent basin hydrograph for every basin on the
graphics monitor. The file 
"disch.basin"
is created  towards the end of simulation of all the basins. This file 
contains  columns of discharge for each basin. The column number corresponds 
to the basin category value in the legend. If the animation configuration mode 
was set then a file is created in the project directory called 
"disch_file".
This file holds basin discharge values at every point in every basin of the 
analysis area.
.PP
.LI ""6. Simulate any particular basin." 8
This part of the menu provides the facility of changing basin characteristics
such as the Manning roughness coefficient and other infiltration parameters.
This choice can be used only after the successful completion of choice 5. 
If the user has provided maps for the parameters then the user should select
"stop" from the menu to make changes to the parameter maps provided to the 
model. 
.PP
.LI ""7. Channel routing of basin hydrographs." 8
This part of the menu connects the basins that were considered independent in
the previous step. Routing of the basin-level hydrographs is done based on the
connectivity between basins. This can generate hydrographs only for seven
stream junctions. If there are more than seven stream junctions then the first
seven stream junction hydrographs are shown. The process of drawing individual
basin animation maps follows the drawing of the hydrographs at stream junctions.
After completing this choice a file 
"disch.junction"
is created. This file contains 
discharge values at different steps for every stream junction.
.PP
.LI ""8. Stop." 8
This part of the menu is available to the user at any time between the different
choices described in the menu and exits the user out of the program.
.PP
.LE
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
1.) Negative values of drainage direction inside basins maps cannot be 
accepted. Negative values are generated as a result of incomplete information
regarding the basin drainage pattern (e.g., \*Lr.watershed\*O produces negative
values as a result of outflowing drainage basins).
.PP
2.) The drainage map should route the water and not form pits, lakes, or ponds.
Note that this does not imply that the DEM by itself should not have any
pits.
.PP
3) Interstorm modeling, interflow, or baseflow are not considered.
.PP
4) Backwater effects are not considered.
.PP
5) The kinematic wave analogy is appropriate where the land surface slope and
channel slope are large. This may not be true in flat, marshy terrain and in
slow, meandering river channels.
.PP
.SH OUTPUT FILES OF INTEREST
.PP
These are ASCII files that can be found in the
"
directory.  The files have a format such that it can be imported to various 
analysis packages.
.PP
.LI "disch.basin 8
This file contains multiple columns which contain the individual 
basin discharge values in order of first column containing the discharge 
values for basin one and the second for basin two and so on. 
.PP
.LI "disch.junction 8
This file contains the results of the discharge values at stream junctions 
specified by the icons. The first column in this file shows the time step in 
minutes. The remaining columns specify the discharge values. The first row 
specifies the stream junction icon numbers. 
.PP
.SH NOTES
1. \*Lr.water.fea\*O alters the region in the 
WIND
file. This is done by making a systems call to:
.PP
g.region align=name
.PP
just when the program \*Lr.water.fea\*O is run.
.PP
2. A small watershed can be analyzed by providing values of model parameters.
However it is advisble to provide maps of various model parameters
if there are many basins in the watershed.  In the former case the value 
provided by the user shall be constant for the entire basin
for which the value is queried. The user shall create the infiltration maps 
using the following set of rules. The map value divided by the multiplication 
factor yields the actual value in the described units:

3. If the user has provided a slope map that has zero slope value anywhere in
the map, then a slope value of 5% is assumed for that cell.
.PP
4. It is preferred that none of the basins in the analysis area has 
more than 750 cells, as this will increase the computation time 
drastically.  The number of cells in a basin can be controlled by setting 
the threshold value to small values when running \*Lr.watershed\*O.
.PP
5. Using larger cells can speed up the analysis process significantly. It is
important to note that \*Lr.watershed\*O should be run for the resolution at 
which the user desires to run the \*Lr.water.fea\*O analysis.
