\fBThe following programs were contributed for the 4.1 GRASS release
and are accompanied by documentation of minimally a manpage.  Some
code has other supporting information.\fR

.IP "d.savescreen -" 16
Screen capture utility for some MASSCOMP graphics monitor.
(GRASS Display Program)

.IP "p.screen -" 16
Prints a graphics monitor display image file that has been saved by
d.savescreen.
(GRASS Paint/Print Output Program)

.IP "r.traj -" 16
Ballistic trajectory modeling program.

.IP "v.mkgrid -" 16
Creates a (binary) GRASS vector map of a user-defined grid.
(GRASS vector)

.IP "v.autocorr -" 16
Calculates spatial autocorrelation statistics for GRASS vector files.
(GRASS vector)

.IP "s.medp -" 16
Median polish for a GRASS sites list.
(GRASS sites)

.IP "d.linegraph -" 16
Generates and displays simple line graphs in the active graphics monitor
display frame.
(GRASS Display Program)

.IP "i.texture -" 16
Calculates textural features on a raster file.
(GRASS Image Processing Program)

.IP "s.voronoi -" 16
Uses a GRASS sites list to produce a Voronoi diagram.

.IP "v.reg -" 16
Computes the latitude and longitude of the exterior and interior corner tic
marks for USGS 7.5' quad maps.

.IP "s.to.rast -" 16
Converts a site file to a cell file.
(CCRS Contrib Program)

.IP "v.in.poly -" 16
Creates a vector file of polygons centered on given locations.
(GRASS Vector Program)

.IP "f.input -" 16
Reads the results of the HEC-2 Water Surface Profile model and generates
a vector map of water surface evaluations at hydraulic sections.

.IP "f.wsurf -" 16
Takes the results of f.input along with a raster terrain elevation map
and generates two raster maps desc
ribing the floodplain.

.IP "f.econ -" 16
Takes as input the results of f.wsurf along with a user-supplied
vector map of building sites and two ASCII files of economic data
and generates a vector map of total damage.

.IP "f.detail -" 16
Functions like f.econ but outputs two detailed reports: economic damage
and depth of flooding.

.IP "f.reach -" 16
Provides floodwater statistics, including areal extent of flooding,
average flood depth, and volume of water, calculated on a
reach-by-reach basis.

.IP "f.acap -" 16
Calculates area-capacity for select areas of interest and shows
relationships between water surface elevation, water surface area, and 
volume of water.

.IP "f.xsection -" 16
Provides an interactive means for digitizing new cross-sections to be
used as input to HEC-2 modeling.
