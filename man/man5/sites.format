.SH NAME
\fIsites.format\fR \- Description of GRASS site list file format.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a description of the site list files found in the GRASS
data base.  The files are kept in the site_lists directory under
the current mapset.
.SH SAMPLE SITES LIST
Here is a sample site list:

.nf
name|sample
desc|sample site list
728220|5182440|27

.SH EXPLANATION
Each record of data begins with a named field describing the
record type, followed by fields of information.  The fields are
separated by the pipe character |.
.SH name
This field contains the name of the site list
file, and is printed on all the reports.

It is permissible for this field to be
missing, since the sites software will force
this field to agree with the name of the site
list file itself.
.SH desc
This field contains a description of the site
list file, and is printed on all the reports.

It is permissible for this field to be
missing, in which case the site list will
have no description.
.SH point
Each site is described by a 'point' record.  The fields for this
record are:

.nf
<east> <north> <description>

<east>           easting for the site
<north>          northing for the site
<description>    site description

.fi
The east and north fields, which are integers, must be present and
valid or the record itself will be skipped by
the sites software.  The description field is optional, but
recommended.

.SH BUGS?
Invalid records will be (silently) ignored by the sites
software.  Other record types may be added in the future.
