.SH NAME
\fIISMcell2grd\fR \- Converts a GRASS raster map layer into an ISM grid file.
.br
.I (GRASS Raster Data Export Program)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBISMcell2grd\fR
.br
\fBISMcell2grd help\fR
.br
\fBISMcell2grd input\fR\*=\fIname \fBoutput\fR\*=\fIname\fR 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIISMcell2grd\fR allows a user to create a grid data file for use in 
Interactive Surface Modeling (ISM) from an existing GRASS raster map layer.
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
\fBParameters:\fR
.IP \fBinput\*=\fIname\fR 20
Name of a binary GRASS raster map input file.
.IP \fBoutput\*=\fIname\fR 20
Name to be assigned to ISM grid data file created.
.LP
If the user simply types \fIISMcell2grd\fR without specifying parameter
values on the command line, the program will prompt the user to enter these.
.SH NOTES
Since the grid file created by \fIISMcell2grd\fR is placed in the current 
directory, the user should run \fIISMcell2grd\fR from the ISM file directory 
or move the new file to the ISM file directory.  In order to use the 
grid file, the user must also add it to the ISM table of contents
(.toc file) by choosing option 3 (edit/create file) under FILE OPERATIONS.
.LP
The user should note that the maximum ISM grid size is 512 x 512, yet
GRASS cell files are often much larger.  \fIISMcell2grd\fR currently 
resamples larger cell files at 512 x 512 resolution.  To 
avoid losing information, the user may want to resize the grass cell file
prior to exporting the data.
