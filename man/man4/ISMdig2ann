\fBISMdig2ann\fR \fBinput\*=\fIname\fR \fBoutput\*=\fIname\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIISMdig2ann\fR
converts a GRASS vector file in binary format to an annotation 
file for use in Interactive Surface Modeling (ISM).
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.B Flags:
.IP \fB-n 18
Do not go interactive.
.LP
.B Parameters:
.IP \fBinput\*=\fIname 18
Name of the binary GRASS vector input file to be converted to ISM annotation 
format.
.IP \fBoutput\*=\fIname 18
Name of the ISM annotation output file.
.LP
If the user runs \fIISMdig2ann\fR without giving the names of an input and
output file on the command line, the program will prompt the user for these
names.
.SH NOTES
\fIISMdig2ann\fR produces windows to enable the user to select line and area 
attributes to be associated with the data in the annotation file.
By clicking on the attribute boxes, the user may select any of 8 different 
colors, 10 different line styles, three line widths, and indicate whether
or not to display the label for each data attribute.  For area attributes, 
there are 22 different fill patterns in 9 sizes.  The \fI-n\fR flag prevents
\fIISMdig2ann\fR from displaying the windows for attribute selection, 
enabling scripts to run uninterrupted.
.LP
Since the annotation file created by \fIISMdig2ann\fR is placed in the current 
directory, the user should run \fIISMdig2ann\fR from the ISM file directory 
or move the new file to the ISM file directory.  In order to use the 
annotation file, the user must also add it to the ISM table of contents
(.toc file) by choosing option 3 (edit/create file) under FILE OPERATIONS.
