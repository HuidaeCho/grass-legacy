.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B r.flow
generates flowlines using a combined raster-vector
approach from an input elevation raster map \fIelevin\fR, and optionally
an input aspect raster map \fIaspin\fR and/or an input barrier raster map
\fIbarin\fR.
There are three possible output maps which can be produced in
any combination simultaneously:  a vector file \fIflout\fR of flowlines,
a raster map \fIlgout\fR of flowpath lengths, and a raster map 
\fIdsout\fR of flowline densities.
.LP
Aspect used for input
must follow the same rules as aspect computed in other GRASS4.1
programs (see r.slope.aspect, s.surf.tps).
.LP
Flowline output is given in a vector map \fIflout\fR.
The line segments of flowline vectors have endpoints on a grid formed by
drawing imaginary lines through the centers of the cells in the elevation map.
Flowlines are generated from each cell downhill by default; they can
be generated uphill using the flag \fB-u\fR.
A flowline stops if its next segment would reverse the direction of flow
(from up to down or vice-versa),
cross a barrier, or arrive at a cell with undefined elevation or aspect.
Another option, \fBskip\fR=\fIval\fR, indicates that only the flowlines from
every \fIval\fRth cell are to be included in \fIflout\fR.  The default
\fBskip\fR is max(1, <rows in \fIelevin\fR>/50, <cols in \fIelevin\fR>/50).
A high \fBskip\fR usually speeds up processing time and often improves
the readability of a visualization of \fIflout\fR.

.LP
Flowpath length output is given in a raster map \fIlgout\fR.
The value in each grid cell is the sum of the
planar lengths of all segments of the flowline generated from that cell.
If the flag
\fB-z\fR is given, elevation is taken into account in calculating the length
of each segment.

.LP
Flowline density output is given in a raster map \fIdsout\fR.
The value in each grid cell is the number of flowlines in the entire map
which have segment endpoints within that cell.

.SH OPTIONS

If the user specifies
program arguments and flag settings on the command line, the program will
immediately begin working.
Alternatively, the user can simply type \fBr.flow\fR on the command line
and the program will ask for
parameter values and flag settings interactively,
using the standard GRASS parser interface.

.LP 
\fBFlags:\fR 
.IP \fB-u\fR 18 
Generate flowlines uphill (default generates flowlines downhill).

.IP \fB-3\fR 18
Compute three-dimensional lengths (default is two-dimensional).

.IP \fB-m\fR 18
Use less memory and compute aspect at each cell on the fly.  This option
incurs a performance penalty.  If this flag is given, the aspect input
map (if any) will be ignored.

.IP \fB-M\fR 18
Use a fixed size memory and utilize page-swapping to handle large input
files.  This option incurs a severe performance penalty but is the only way
to handle arbitrarily-large data files.  If this flag is given, the \fB-m\fR
flag will be ignored.

.IP \fB-q\fR 18
Quiet operation.  Do not print diagnostic messages indicating progress.

.LP
\fBParameters:\fR

.IP \fBelevin\fR=\fIname\fR 18
Use the existing raster file \fIname\fR with elevations as input (required).

.IP \fBaspin\fR=\fIname\fR 18
Use the existing raster file \fIname\fR with aspects as input.

.IP \fBbarin\fR=\fIname\fR 18
Use the existing raster file \fIname\fR with non-zero values representing
barriers as input.

.IP \fBskip\fR=\fIval\fR 18
Set the number of cells between flowlines in the \fBflout\fR output
map to \fIval\fR.

.IP \fBbound\fR=\fIval\fR 18
Set the maximum number of segments of each flowline to \fIval\fR (default is
the maximum possible).

.IP \fBflout\fR=\fIname\fR 18
Output coordinates of flowlines to a vector file named \fIname\fR.

.IP \fBlgout\fR=\fIname\fR 18
Output flowpath length values to a raster file named \fIname\fR.

.IP \fBdsout\fR=\fIname\fR 18
Output flowline density values to a raster file named \fIname\fR.

.SH NOTES

For best results, use input elevation maps with high precision units (e.g.,
centimeters) so that flowlines do not terminate prematurely in flat areas.
.LP
To prevent the creation of tiny flowline segments with imperceivable changes
in elevation, an endpoint which would land very close to the center of a grid
cell is quantized to the exact center of that cell.  The maximum distance
between the intercepts along each axis of a single diagonal segment and
another segment of 1/2 degree different aspect is taken to be "very close"
for that axis.  Note that this distance (the so-called "quantization error")
is about 1-2% of the resolution on maps with square cells.
.LP
The values in length maps computed using the \fI\-u\fR flag
represent the distances from each cell to an upland flat or singular point.
Such distances are useful in
water erosion modeling for computation of the LS factor
in the standard form of USLE.
Uphill flowlines tend to merge on ridge
lines;
by redirecting the order of the flowline points in
the output vector map,
dispersed waterflow can be
simulated. The density map can be used for the extraction
of ridge lines.
.LP
Computing the flowlines downhill simulates
the actual flow (also known as the raindrop method).
These flowlines tend to merge in valleys; they can be
used for localization of areas with waterflow accumulation
and for the extraction of valley lines.  The downslope flowline
density multiplied by the resolution is equal to the upslope contributing 
area, defined as the area from which water flows into a given cell.
This area is a measure of potential water flux and can be used
in the modeling of water erosion for the computation of the unit stream
power based LS factor.
.LP
The program has been designed for modeling erosion on hillslopes and
has rather strict conditions for ending flowlines.  It is therefore not very
suitable for the extraction of stream networks or delineation of watersheds
unless a DEM without pits or flat areas is available.
.LP
If r.flow is invoked with the \fI-M\fR flag, it will create up to
three segment files; concurrently running copies of r.flow using this flag
will compete
for the same three files.  Until concurrency control is standardized in GRASS
it is suggested that all concurrently running copies of r.flow using
the \fB-M\fR flag
have distinct input and output files.

region resolution

The resolutions of all input files and the current region must match.
In future versions this error will be demoted to a warning.
.TP
.BI "ERROR: r.flow: resolution too unbalanced (" val " x " val ")"
The difference in length between the two axes of a grid cell is so great that
quantization error is larger than one of the dimensions.  Resample the map
and try again.
