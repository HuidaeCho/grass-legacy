.SH NAME
\fIISMcell2scat\fR \- Converts a GRASS raster map layer into an ISM scattered data file.
.br
.I (GRASS Raster Data Export Program)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBISMcell2scat\fR
.br
\fBISMcell2scat help\fR
.br
\fBISMcell2scat \fIGRASS_file_name ISM_file_name\fR 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIISMcell2scat\fR allows a user to create a scattered data file for use in Interactive Surface Modeling (ISM) from an existing GRASS raster map layer.
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
\fBParameters:\fR
.IP \fIGRASS_file_name\fR 20
Name of a binary GRASS raster map input file.
.IP \fIISM_file_name\fR 20
Name to be assigned to ISM scattered data file created.
.SH NOTES
.LP
For each (x,y) position in the original cell file, \fIISMcell2scat\fR 
assigns an attribute for the scattered data file.  This program is
useful when the user wants to take advantage of smoothing capabilities
of ISM. 
.LP
The user should note that the maximum ISM grid size is 512 x 512, yet
GRASS cell files are often much larger.  \fIISMcell2scat\fR currently 
resamples larger cell files at 512 x 512 resolution.  To 
avoid losing information, the user may want to resize the grass cell file
prior to exporting the data.
.LP
Since the scattered data file created by \fIISMcell2scat\fR is placed in the current 
directory, the user should run \fIISMcell2scat\fR from the ISM file directory 
or move the new file to the ISM file directory.  In order to use the 
scattered data file, the user must also add it to the ISM table of contents
(.toc file) by choosing option 3 (edit/create file) under FILE OPERATIONS.
