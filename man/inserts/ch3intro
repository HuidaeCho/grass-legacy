.IH "3	UNIX SHELL SCRIPT PROGRAMS"
.LP
Like Main Programs, UNIX shell script programs have received both alpha- and
beta-testing.  However, while other GRASS programs are written in the "C"
programming language, shell scripts are UNIX Bourne and C-shell scripts
readily developable by nonprogrammers and others unfamiliar with "C."  
Shell scripts are separately described for the convenience of potential system 
developers at GRASS user sites, who
are encouraged to examine the shell 
scripts located on-line in the directories indicated in this manual, and
to develop their own scripts.
