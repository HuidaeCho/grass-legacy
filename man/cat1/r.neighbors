NAME
     r.neighbors - Makes each cell category value a function of
     the category values assigned to the cells around it, and
     stores new cell values in an output raster map layer.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.neighbors
     r.neighbors help
     r.neighbors [-aq] input=name output=name method=name
	size=value [title="phrase"]

DESCRIPTION
     r.neighbors looks at each cell in a raster input file, and
     examines the category values assigned to the cells in some
     user-defined "neighborhood" around it.  It outputs a new
     raster map layer in which each cell is assigned a category
     value that is some (user-specified) function of the values
     in that cell's neighborhood.  For example, each cell in the
     output layer might be assigned a category value equal to the
     average of the category values appearing in its 3 x 3 cell
     "neighborhood" in the input layer.

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies program arguments (see OPTIONS) on the command
     line.  Alternately, the user can simply type r.neighbors on
     the command line, without program arguments.  In this case,
     the user will be prompted for flag settings and parameter
     values.

OPTIONS
     The user must specify the names of the raster map layers to
     be used for input and output, the method used to analyze
     neighborhood category values (i.e., the neighborhood
     function or operation to be performed), and the size of the
     neighborhood.  Optionally, the user can also specify the
     title to be assigned to the raster map layer output, elect
     to not align the resolution of the output with that of the
     input (the -a option), and elect to run r.neighbors quietly
     (the -q option).  These options are described further below.

     Neighborhood Operation Methods: The neighborhood operators
     determine what new category value a center cell in a
     neighborhood will have after examining category values
     inside its neighboring cells.  Each cell in a raster map
     layer becomes the center cell of a neighborhood as the
     neighborhood window moves from cell to cell throughout the
     map layer.	 r.neighbors can perform the following
     operations:

     average	       The average category value within the
		       neighborhood.  In the following example,

		       the result would be:
			    (7*4 + 6 + 5 + 4*3)/9 = 5.66
		       The result is rounded to the nearest
		       integer (in this case 6).

     median	       The category value found half-way through
		       a list of the neighborhood's category
		       values, when these are ranged in numerical
		       order.

     mode	       The most frequently occurring category
		       value in the neighborhood.

     minimum	       The minimum category value within the
		       neighborhood.

     maximum	       The maximum category value within the
		       neighborhood.

     stddev	       The statistical standard deviation of
		       category values within the neighborhood
		       (rounded to the nearest integer).

     variance	       The statistical variance of category
		       values within the neighborhood (rounded to
		       the nearest integer).

     diversity	       The number of different category values
		       within the neighborhood.	 In the above
		       example, the diversity is 4.

     interspersion     The percentage of cells containing
		       categories which differ from the category
		       assigned to the center cell in the
		       neighborhood, plus 1.  In the above
		       example, the interspersion is:
			    5/8 * 100 + 1 = 63.5
		       The result is rounded to the nearest
		       integer (in this case 64).

     Neighborhood Size: The neighborhood size specifies which
     cells surrounding any given cell fall into the neighborhood
     for that cell.  The size must be an odd integer.  Options
     are:  1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25.

     -a	  If specified, r.neighbors will not align the output
	  raster map layer with that of the input raster map
	  layer.  The r.neighbors program works in the current
	  geographic region.  It is recommended, but not
	  required, that the resolution of the geographic region
	  be the same as that of the raster map layer.	By
	  default, if unspecified, r.neighbors will align these
	  geographic region settings.

     -q	  If specified, r.neighbors will run relatively quietly
	  (i.e., without printing to standard output notes on the
	  program's progress).	If unspecified, the program will
	  print messages to standard output by default.

NOTES
     The r.neighbors program works in the current geographic
     region with the current mask, if any.  It is recommended,
     but not required, that the resolution of the geographic
     region be the same as that of the raster map layer.  By
     default, r.neighbors will align these geographic region
     settings.	However, the user can elect to keep original
     input and output resolutions which are not aligned by
     specifying this (e.g., using the -a option).

     r.neighbors copies the GRASS color files associated with the
     input raster map layer for those output map layers that are
     based on the neighborhood average, median, mode, minimum,
     and maximum.  Because standard deviation, variance,
     diversity, and interspersion are indices, rather than direct
     correspondents to input category values, no color files are
     copied for these map layers.  (The user should note that
     although the color file is copied for averaged neighborhood
     function output, whether or not the color file makes sense
     for the output will be dependent on the input data values.)
