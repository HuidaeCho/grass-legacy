NAME
     r.neighbors  - Makes each cell category value a function of
     the category values assigned to the cells around it, and
     stores new cell values in an output raster map layer.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.neighbors
     r.neighbors help
     r.neighbors [-aq] input=name method=name [title="phrase"]

DESCRIPTION
     r.neighbors looks at each cell in a raster input file, and
     examines the category values assigned to the cells in some
     user-defined "neighborhood" around it.  It outputs a new
     raster map layer in which each cell is assigned a category
     value that is some (user-specified) function of the values
     in that cell's neighborhood.  For example, each cell in the
     output layer might be assigned a category value equal to the
     average of the category values appearing in its 3 x 3 cell
     "neighborhood" in the input layer.

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies program arguments (see OPTIONS) on the command
     line.  Alternately, the user can simply type r.neighbors on
     the command line, without program arguments.  In this case,
     the user will be prompted for flag settings and parameter
     values.

OPTIONS
     The user must specify the names of the raster map layers to
     be used for input, the method used to analyze neighborhood
     category values (i.e., the neighborhood function or
     operation to be performed), and the size of the
     neighborhood.  Optionally, the user can also specify the
     title to be assigned to the raster map layer output, elect
     to not align the resolution of the output with that of the
     input (the -a option), and elect to run r.neighbors option).
     These options are described further below.

     Neighborhood Operation Methods: The neighborhood operators
     determine what new category value a center cell in a
     neighborhood will have after examining category values
     inside its neighboring cells.  Each cell in a raster map
     layer becomes the center cell of a neighborhood as the
     neighborhood window moves from cell to cell throughout the
     map layer.	 r.neighbors can perform the following
     operations:

     The average category value within the neighborhood.  In the
     following example, the result would be:
     (7*4 + 6 + 5 + 4*3)/9 = 5.66

     The result is rounded to the nearest integer (in this case
     6).  The category value found half-way through a list of the
     neighborhood's category values, when these are ranged in
     numerical order.  The most frequently occurring category
     value in the neighborhood.	 The minimum category value
     within the neighborhood.  The maximum category value within
     the neighborhood.

     The statistical standard deviation of category values within
     the neighborhood (rounded to the nearest integer).	 The
     statistical variance of category values within the
     neighborhood (rounded to the nearest integer).  The number
     of different category values within the neighborhood.  In
     the above example, the diversity is 4.  The percentage of
     cells containing categories which differ from the category
     assigned to the center cell in the neighborhood, plus 1.  In
     the above example, the interspersion is:
     5/8 * 100 + 1 = 63.5
     The result is rounded to the nearest integer (in this case
     64).  ERROR .RE

     Neighborhood Size: The neighborhood size specifies which
     cells surrounding any given cell fall into the neighborhood
     for that cell.  The size must be an odd integer.  Options
     are:  1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25.
     For example,

				   _ _ _
				  |_|_|_|
	 3 x 3 neighborhood -  |_|_|_|
				  |_|_|_|


     If specified, r.neighbors will not align the output raster
     map layer with that of the input raster map layer.	 The
     r.neighbors program works in the current geographic region.
     It is recommended, but not required, that the resolution of
     the geographic region be the same as that of the raster map
     layer.  By default, if unspecified, r.neighbors will align
     these geographic region settings.	If specified, r.neighbors
     will run relatively quietly (i.e., without printing to
     standard output notes on the program's progress).	If
     unspecified, the program will print messages to standard

     output by default.

NOTES
     The r.neighbors program works in the current geographic
     region with the current mask, if any.  It is recommended,
     but not required, that the resolution of the geographic
     region be the same as that of the raster map layer.  By
     default, r.neighbors will align these geographic region
     settings.	However, the user can elect to keep original
     input and output resolutions which are not aligned by
     specifying this (e.g., using the -a option).

     r.neighbors files associated with the input raster map layer
     for those output map layers that are based on the
     neighborhood average, median, mode, minimum, and maximum.
     Because standard deviation, variance, diversity, and
     interspersion are indices, rather than direct correspondents
     to input category values, no color files are copied for
     these map layers.	(The user should note that although the
     color file is copied for averaged neighborhood function
     output, whether or not the color file makes sense for the
     output will be dependent on the input data values.)
