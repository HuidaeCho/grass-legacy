NAME
     v.in.dlg2 - Converts an ASCII or binary USGS DLG-3 (bdlg)
     file to a binary GRASS vector (dig) file.
     (GRASS Vector Data Import Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.in.dlg2
     v.in.dlg2 help
     v.in.dlg2 [-bl] input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     This program converts an ASCII or binary USGS DLG-3 (dlg.old
     or bdlg.old) file into a binary GRASS vector (dig) file.

     v.in.dlg2 also creates a dig_att file containing the label
     information 'stripped' from the DLG-3 file.  However, the
     user must run v.support (or v.import option 4) on the output
     file created by v.in.dlg2 to create a dig_plus file
     containing the file topology, before using the output file
     in v.digit.

     The user can avoid this two-step process by converting the
     ASCII or binary DLG-3 file to binary GRASS vector format
     using option 1 or 2 of the GRASS program v.import.


     Flags:

     -b		       Input is a binary DLG-3 file (default is
		       ASCII).

     -l		       Give precedence to line information
		       (default is area).


     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of USGS DLG-3 Optional format input
		       file.

     output=name       Name to be assigned to the binary GRASS
		       vector files created.

     If the user simply types v.in.dlg2 without specifying
     parameter values on the command line, the program will
     prompt the user to enter these.

NOTES
     Area vs Line Precedence:

     Some machine-processed DLG-3 files do not make the
     distinction between line edges and area edges.  For example,

     in a roads map, where the desired information is line edge
     data, a downtown block surrounded by roads may be processed
     as an area.  Because of this, the user is asked to choose
     whether to give precedence to areas or lines.  If precedence
     is given to lines, the user should be aware that any lines
     that bound unlabeled areas in the DLG-3 file will be stored
     as line data.  Any unlabeled areas would therefore be lost
     (this is only a concern when areas are unlabeled;	labeled
     area information will be retained).  If precedence is given
     to areas, lines will be stored as boundaries to areas that
     are unlabeled.


     Building support files with v.support:

     When you run v.support you will have the option of snapping
     the nodes in your vector file that fall within a certain
     threshold of one another.	WARNING:  the default threshold
     is calculated using the scale of the original DLG-3 file.
     If the threshold is too high, excessive snapping may occur,
     destroying the file!!  With v.support, the user has the
     option of snapping or not snapping nodes, and further, of
     setting a particular snapping threshold.
