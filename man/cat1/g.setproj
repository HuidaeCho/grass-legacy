     _g_._s_e_t_p_r_o_j - Allows the user to create the PROJ_INFO and the
     PROJ_UNITS files to record the projection information
     associated with a current location.

     Allows a user to create a PROJ_INFO file in the PERMANENT
     mapset of the current location. PROJ_INFO file is used to
     record the projection information associated with the
     specified mapset.

     NNootteess::

          User running _g_._s_e_t_p_r_o_j must own PERMANENT mapset.  It
          is highly recommended to run _g_._s_e_t_p_r_o_j after creating a
          new location so that conversion programs (such as
          _v_._p_r_o_j) can be run.
          The current location must not contain a PROJ_INFO or
          PROJ_UNITS file.
          The user will be prompted for the projection name.
          The specification of any projection other than ll and
          stp will generate a request to the user for a name of a
          standard ellipse.
          The projections of aea, lcc, merc, and tmerc will
          generate a request to the user for the prime meridian
          and standard parallel for the output map.
          The projection of stp will generate a request to the
          user for the choice of zone for the output map.
          The user will be prompted for the spheroid and zone of
          the UTM projection.
