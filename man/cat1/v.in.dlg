NAME
     v.in.dlg - Converts an ASCII USGS DLG-3 Optional file to a
     binary GRASS vector (dig) file.
     (GRASS Vector Data Import Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.in.dlg
     v.in.dlg help
     v.in.dlg [-l] input=name output=name [matt=name] [base=val]

DESCRIPTION
     This program converts an ASCII USGS DLG-3 (dlg) file into a
     binary GRASS vector (dig) file.
     Warning:  The program reads DLG-3 Optional format only.

     v.in.dlg also creates a dig_att file containing the label
     information 'stripped' from the DLG-3 file (the first minor
     attribute for each record unless matt is specified).

     If the matt is specified, v.in.dlg creates an additional
     attribute file containing identifiers for every record with
     correspon ding multiple attributes.  In this case matt file
     contains identifiers starting with base base for the
     attributes stored in matt file (as opposed to the first
     minor attributes with no matt file).  The example of matt
     with base = 34 would be:

	  34   0    0
	  35   180  201
	  36   180  208
	       170  240
	       190  201
	  37   160  220

     With the corresponding dig_att looking like this:

	  A 648467.190000 4456367.320000     34
	  L 667989.290000 4458393.520000     35
	  L 651002.470000 4473793.390000     36
	  L 663816.680000 4471412.080000     37


     However, the user must run v.support (or v.import option 4)
     on the output file created by v.in.dlg to create a dig_plus
     file containing the file topology, before using the output
     file in v.digit.

     The user can avoid this two-step process by converting the
     ASCII DLG-3 file to binary GRASS vector format using option
     1 of the GRASS program v.import.

     -l		       Give precedence to line information
		       (default is area).


     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of USGS DLG-3 Optional format input
		       file.

     output=name       Name to be assigned to the binary GRASS
		       vector files created.

     matt=name	       Name of file with multiple attributes
		       (optional).

     base=val	       Identifier base for multiple attributes
		       (default is 1).

     If the user simply types v.in.dlg without specifying
     parameter values on the command line, the program will
     prompt the user to enter these.

NOTES
     Area vs Line Precedence:

     Some machine-processed DLG-3 files do not make the
     distinction between line edges and area edges.  For example,
     in a roads map, where the desired information is line edge
     data, a downtown block surrounded by roads may be processed
     as an area.  Because of this, the user is asked to choose
     whether to give precedence to areas or lines.  If precedence
     is given to lines, the user should be aware that any lines
     that bound unlabeled areas in the DLG-3 file will be stored
     as line data.  Any unlabeled areas would therefore be lost
     (this is only a concern when areas are unlabeled;	labeled
     area information will be retained).  If precedence is given
     to areas, lines will be stored as boundaries to areas that
     are unlabeled.


     Building support files with v.support:

     When you run v.support you will have the option of snapping
     the nodes in your vector file that fall within a certain
     threshold of one another.	WARNING:  the default threshold
     is calculated using the scale of the original DLG-3 file.
     If the threshold is too high, excessive snapping may occur,
     destroying the file!!  With v.support, the user has the
     option of snapping or not snapping nodes, and further, of
     setting a particular snapping threshold.
