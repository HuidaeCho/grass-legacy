r.line <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	    <main> r.line



NAME
     r.line - Creates a	new binary GRASS vector	(v.digit) file by
     extracting	linear features	from a thinned raster file.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.line
     r.line help
     r.line input=name output=name [type=name]

DESCRIPTION
     r.line scans the named raster map layer (input=name) and
     extracts thinned linear features into the named vector file
     (output=name).

OPTIONS
     The user can run this program either non-interactively or
     interactively.  The program will be run non-interactively if
     the user specifies	program	arguments on the command line,
     using the form:

	  r.line input=name output=name	[type=name]

     If	the user specifies input raster	and output vector map
     names on the command line,	any other parameter values left
     unspecified on the	command	line will be set to their default
     values (see below).  Alternately, the user	can simply type
     r.line on the command line, without program arguments.  In
     this case,	the user will be prompted for parameter	values
     using the standard	GRASS parser interface described in the
     manual entry for parser.

     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of existing	raster file to be used as
		       input.

     output=name       Name of new vector file to be output.

     type=name	       Line type of the	extracted vectors; either
		       line or area.  Specifying line will type
		       extracted vectors as linear edges.
		       Specifying area will type extracted
		       vectors as area edges.
		       Options:	 line or area
		       Default:	 type=line

     r.line assumes that the input map has been	thinned	using
     r.thin.

NOTES
     r.line extracts vectors (aka, "arcs") from	a raster file.

     These arcs	may represent linear features (like roads or
     streams), or may represent	area edge features (like
     political boundaries, or soil mapping units).  The	attribute
     type option allows	the user to establish the use of either
     linear or area edge attributes for	all of the extracted
     vectors.

     r.poly may	be used	to extract vectors that	represent area
     features (like soil mapping units,	elevation ranges, etc.)
     from a raster file.

     The user must run v.support on the	resultant vector
     (v.digit) files to	build the dig_plus information.

     r.thin and	r.line may create excessive nodes at every
     junction, and may create small spurs or "dangling lines"
     during the	thinning and vectorization process.  These
     excessive nodes and spurs may be removed using v.trim.

BUGS
     The input raster file MUST	be thinned by r.thin; if not,
     r.line may	crash.
