r.rescale            GRASS Reference Manual             r.rescale



NAME
     r.rescale - Rescales the range of category values in a
     raster map layer.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.rescale
     r.rescale help
     r.rescale [-q] input=name [from=min,max] output=name [to=min,max] \
           [title="phrase"]

DESCRIPTION
     The r.rescale program rescales the range of category values
     appearing in a raster map layer.  A new raster map layer,
     and an appropriate category file and color table based upon
     the original raster map layer, are generated with category
     labels that reflect the original category values that
     produced each category.  This command is useful for
     producing representations with a reduced number of
     categories from a raster map layer with a large range of
     category values (e.g., elevation). Rescaled map layers are
     appropriate for use in such GRASS programs as r.stats,
     r.report, and r.coin.

     r.rescale will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies program arguments on the command line, using the
     form:

     r.rescale [-q] input=name [from=min,max] output=name [to=min,max] \
           [title="phrase"]

     Alternately, the user can simply type:

          r.rescale

     on the command line without program arguments.  In this
     case, the user will be prompted for parameter values using
     the standard GRASS user interface described in the manual
     entry for parser.

     Flag:

     -q                Run quietly, without printing messages on
                       program progress to the user's terminal.

     Parameters:

     input=name        The name of the raster map layer whose
                       category values are to be rescaled.

     from=min,max      The input map range to be rescaled.
                       Default:  The full range of the input map

                       layer.

     output=name       The name of the new, rescaled raster map
                       layer.

     to=min,max        The output map range (after rescaling).
                       Default:  1,255

     title="phrase"    Title for new output raster map layer.

EXAMPLE
     To rescale an elevation raster map layer with category
     values ranging from 1090 meters to 1800 meters into the
     range 1-255, the following command line could be used:

          r.rescale  input=elevation  from=1090,1800  output=elevation.255  to=1,255

NOTES
     The rescaled category value range is actually unlimited, but
     the category value range 1 to 255 is frequently used due to
     limitations of color graphics monitors.

     Category values that fall beyond the input range will become
     zero.  This allows the user to select a subset of the full
     category value range for rescaling if desired.  This also
     means that the user should know the category value range for
     the input raster map layer.  The user can request the
     r.rescale program to determine this range, or can obtain it
     using the r.describe command.  If the category value range
     is determined using r.rescale, the input raster map layer is
     examined, and the minimum and maximum non-zero category
     values are selected as the input range.
