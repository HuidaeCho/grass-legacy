NAME
     r.in.ascii	 - Convert an ASCII raster text file into a
     (binary) raster map layer.
     (GRASS Raster Data Import Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.in.ascii
     r.in.ascii help
     r.in.ascii[-ifd] input=name]

DESCRIPTION
     r.in.ascii allows a user to create a (binary) GRASS raster
     map layer from an ASCII raster input file with (optional)
     title.

OPTIONS
Flags:
     Integer values are imported.  Floating point values are
     imported.	Double floating point values are imported.

Parameters:
     Name of an existing ASCII raster file to be imported.  Name
     to be assigned to resultant binary raster map layer.  Title
     to be assigned to resultant raster map layer.  Multiply all
     raster cell values by multiplier.	multiplier is a floating
     point value, and has a default value of 1.0.  String
     representing NULL value data cells.  The input file has a
     header section which describes the location and size of the
     data, followed by the data itself.

     The header has 6 lines:

     north:   xxxxxx.xx south:	 xxxxxx.xx east:    xxxxxx.xx
     west:    xxxxxx.xx rows:	 r cols:    c

     The north, south, east, and west field values entered are
     the coordinates of the edges of the geographic region.  The
     rows and cols field values entered describe the dimensions
     of the matrix of data to follow.  The data which follows is
     r integers.

EXAMPLE
     The following is a sample input

     north:		      4299000.00 south:
     4247000.00 east:			  528000.00 west:
     500000.00 rows:			     10 cols:
     15

NOTES
     The geographic coordinates north, south, east, and west
     describe the outer edges of the geographic region.	 They run
     along the edges of the cells at the edge of the geographic
     region and not through the center of the cells at the edges.

     The data (which follows the header section) must contain r x
     c values, but it is not necessary that all the data for a
     row be on one line.  A row may be split over many lines.

     r.in.ascii handles floating point cell values, but truncates
     them into integer values. The mult option allows the number
     of significant figures of a floating point cell to be
     increased before truncation to an integer. Multiples of ten
     are the most functional multipliers.
