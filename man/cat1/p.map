NAME
     _p._m_a_p - Hardcopy color map output utility.
     (_G_R_A_S_S _H_a_r_d_c_o_p_y _O_u_t_p_u_t _P_r_o_g_r_a_m)

SYNOPSIS
     p.map
     p.map help
     p.map [input=_n_a_m_e] [scale=_m_a_p_s_c_a_l_e]

DESCRIPTION
     _p._m_a_p produces hardcopy color map products on your system's
     color output device.  Output can include a raster map, any
     number of vector overlays, site data, text labels, and other
     spatial data.

     This program has 2 distincts modes of operation.  The
     command-line mode requires the user to prepare a file of
     mapping instructions describing the various spatial and
     textual information to be printed prior to running _p._m_a_p.
     The interactive mode (i.e., no command-line arguments) will
     prompt the user for items to be mapped and does not require
     the user to prepare a file of instructions.

     The command-line parameters are:

     input=_n_a_m_e        File containing mapping instructions.  (or
                       enter input=- to enter from keyboard).
                       These instructions are described in detail
                       below.

     scale=_m_a_p_s_c_a_l_e    Scale of the output map,  e.g. 1:25000
                       Default:  1panel

                       This parameter is provided as a
                       convenience.  It is identical to the _s_c_a_l_e
                       mapping instruction described below.


     Note: the user must select an output device using _p._s_e_l_e_c_t
     before running _p._m_a_p.  Also, the _p_r_e_v_i_e_w device can be
     selected to view the output from _p._m_a_p on the graphics
     monitor instead of sending it to a paper printer.


MAPPING INSTRUCTIONS
     The mapping instructions allow the user to specify various
     spatial data to be plotted. These instructions are normally
     prepared in a regular text file using a system editor.  Some
     instructions are single line instructions while others are
     multiple line. Multiple line instructions consist of the
     main instruction followed by a subsection of one or more
     additional instructions.

p.map <main>         GRASS Reference Manual          <main> p.map



colormode
     Selects the appropriate method to color raster map layers
     and images.

     USAGE:   colormode approx|best

     There are two methods: _a_p_p_r_o_x_i_m_a_t_e and _b_e_s_t. From a user
     perspective, _a_p_p_r_o_x_i_m_a_t_e can be used for raster map layers
     with few categories, such as soils, and _b_e_s_t should be used
     for images like LANDSAT images or NHAP photos, or maps with
     many categories.  The _a_p_p_r_o_x_i_m_a_t_e mode treats each pixel
     independently, giving it the printer color that best
     approximates the true color.  The _b_e_s_t mode "blends" colors
     from pixel to pixel using a dithering technique to simulate
     more colors than the printer can actually print.  The
     default, if unspecified, is _b_e_s_t.

     This example would select the _a_p_p_r_o_x_i_m_a_t_e colormode.  The
     assumption is that the raster map layer being printed is has
     few colors or that the colors would not look good dithered.

     EXAMPLE:   colormode approx


colortable
     Includes the color table for the raster map layer in the
     legend below the map

     USAGE:   colortable [y|n]

     The color table will display the colors for each raster map
     layer category value and the category label.  To get a color
     table, you must have previously requested a raster map
     layer.  Omitting the colortable instruction would result in
     no color table.  Note:  Be careful about asking for color
     tables for raster map layers which have many categories,
     such as elevation.  This could result in the printing of an
     extremely long color table!!!!!

     This example would print a color table as part of the legend
     to the map.
     EXAMPLE:   colortable y



comments
     Prints comments beneath the map .  You may submit comment
     text line by line during _p._m_a_p execution or a via a prepared
     comments file.

     USAGE:   comments [commentfile]
              comments

p.map <main>         GRASS Reference Manual          <main> p.map



              end

     This example prints the comment "This is a comment" in the
     legend below the map.
     EXAMPLE:   comments
                  This is a comment.
                  end

     This example prints whatever is in the file _v_e_g._c_o_m_m_e_n_t_s in
     the legend below the map.
     EXAMPLE:   raster vegetation
                comments veg.comments
                  end

     Presumably, the file _v_e_g._c_o_m_m_e_n_t_s contain comments
     pertaining to the raster map layer _v_e_g_e_t_a_t_i_o_n, such as "This
     map was created by classifying a LANDSAT TM image".



defpat
     Defines area fill patterns to be used in the _s_e_t_p_a_t
     instruction.

     USAGE:   defpat name
               pattern
              color # color
              end


     The pattern is given a name on the _d_e_f_p_a_t instruction line.
     The pattern which follows is composed of a sequence of
     numbers 0-9 (and blanks, which are equivalent to 0).  The
     blanks or zeros indicate holes in the pattern where the
     normal category color would show thru. The other number 1-9
     indicate pattern pixels and can be assigned any color.  The
     default color for all the digits will be black unless
     specified with the _c_o_l_o_r instruction.  The color option will
     begin by entering the word _c_o_l_o_r followed by one of the
     digits (1-9) in the pattern, followed by one of the NAMED
     COLORS.  This should be repeated for each of the digits
     specified to avoid using black.  The instruction _e_n_d
     terminates the pattern definition.  Of course, the user can
     define more patterns by entering more _d_e_f_p_a_t instructions.

     NOTE: Do NOT indent the pattern.  Leading blank spaces will
     be interpreted as 0's.

     This example creates a black horizontal line pattern.
     EXAMPLE:   defpat horiz
                1
                0



GRASS 4.1                U.S. Army CERL                         3

                0
                0
                color 1 black
                end

     This example creates a green vertical line pattern.
     EXAMPLE:   defpat vert
                1000
                color 1 green
                end

     This example creates a red diagonal line pattern.
     EXAMPLE:   defpat diag
                00001
                0001
                001
                01
                1
                color 1 red
                end

     This example creates a two-toned tree pattern with orange
     trunks and green leaves.
     EXAMPLE:   defpat tree
                     2
                    222
                   22122
                  22 1 22
                     1

                               2
                              222
                             22122
                            22 1 22
                               1
                color 1 orange
                color 2 black
                end


endpanel
     Specifies which panel number to end printing.  The default
     is 0, and will print all panels from the startpanel to the
     last panel.

     EXAMPLE:   endpanel 4

     This example would end output at panel 4.


grid
     Overlays a coordinate grid onto the output map.



4                        U.S. Army CERL                 GRASS 4.1






p.map <main>         GRASS Reference Manual          <main> p.map



     USAGE:   grid spacing
                color color
                numbers # [color]
                end

     The spacing of the grid is given (in the geographic
     coordinate system units) on the main instruction line.  The
     subsection instructions allow the user to specify the color
     of the grid lines, whether coordinate numbers should appear
     on the grid lines, and if they should appear every grid line
     (1), every other grid line (2), etc., and what color the
     numbers should be.  The defaults are black grid lines,
     unnumbered.

     This example would overlay a green grid with a spacing of
     10000 meters (for a metered database, like UTM) onto the
     output map.  Alternate grid lines would be numbered with red
     numbers.

     EXAMPLE:   grid 10000
                  color green
                  numbers 2 red
                  end



labels
     Selects a labels file for output (see manual entry for
     _p._l_a_b_e_l_s).

     USAGE:   labels  labelfile|_l_i_s_t

     This example would paint labels from the labels file called
     _t_o_w_n._n_a_m_e_s.  Presumably, these labels would indicate the
     names of towns on the map.

     EXAMPLE:   labels town.names


line
     Draws lines on the output map.

     USAGE:   line east north east north
              line x% y% x% y%
                color color
                width #
                masked [y|n]
                end

     The beginning and ending points of the line are entered on
     the main instruction.  These points can be defined either by
     map coordinates or by using percentages of the geographic



GRASS 4.1                U.S. Army CERL                         5






p.map <main>         GRASS Reference Manual          <main> p.map



     region.  The user may also specify line color, width in
     pixels, and if the line is to be masked by the current mask.
     (See manual entry for _r._m_a_s_k for more information on the
     mask.)

     This example would draw a yellow line from the point x=10%
     y=80% to the point x=30% y=70%. This line would be 2 pixels
     wide and would appear even if there is a mask.

     EXAMPLE:   line 10% 80% 30% 70%
                  color yellow
                  width 2
                  masked n
                  end

     Of course, multiple lines may be drawn with multiple _l_i_n_e
     instructions.


outline
     Outlines the areas of a raster map layer with a specified
     color.

     USAGE:   outline
                color  color
                end


     Distinct areas of the raster map will be separated from each
     other visually by drawing a border (or outline) in the
     specified color (default: black).  Note: it is important the
     user enter the instruction end even if a color is not
     chosen.  (It is hoped that in the future the outline of a
     different raster map layer other than the one currently
     being painted may be placed on the map.)

     This example would outline the category areas of the _s_o_i_l_s
     raster map layer in grey.
     EXAMPLE:   raster soils
                outline
                color grey
                end


point
     Places additional points or icons on the output map.

     USAGE:   point east north
              point x% y%
                color color
                icon iconfile|_l_i_s_t
                size #



6                        U.S. Army CERL                 GRASS 4.1






p.map <main>         GRASS Reference Manual          <main> p.map



                masked [y|n]
                end

     The point location is entered in the main instruction line
     by giving either the map coordinates or by using percentages
     of the geographic region.  The user may also specify the
     point color, the icon file to be used to represent the point
     location (see the the manual entry for _p._i_c_o_n_s), the size of
     the icon in integer multiples of the pattern in the icon
     file, and whether the point is to be masked by the current
     mask. (See manual entry for _r._m_a_s_k for more information on
     the mask.)

     This example would place a purple diamond (from icon file
     _d_i_a_m_o_n_d) at the point (E456000 N7890000).  This diamond
     would be the same size it is in the diamond icon file and
     would not be masked by the current mask.

     EXAMPLE:   point 456000 7890000
                  color purple
                  icon diamond
                  size 1
                  masked n
                  end


     Of course, multiple points may be drawn with multiple _p_o_i_n_t
     instructions.


raster
     Selects a raster map layer for output.

     USAGE:   raster mapname|_l_i_s_t

     For each _p._m_a_p run, only one raster map layer can be
     requested.  If no raster map layer is requested, a
     completely white map will be produced.  It can be useful to
     select no raster map layer in order to provide a white
     background for vector images.

     This example would paint a map of the raster map layer
     _s_o_i_l_s.
     EXAMPLE:   raster soils



read
     Provides _p._m_a_p with a previously prepared input stream.

     USAGE:   read previously prepared UNIX file




GRASS 4.1                U.S. Army CERL                         7






p.map <main>         GRASS Reference Manual          <main> p.map



     Mapping instructions can be placed into a file and read into
     _p._m_a_p.

     Note: _p._m_a_p will not search for this file.  The user must be
     in the correct directory or specify the full path on the
     read instruction.  (Note to /bin/csh users: ~ won't work
     with this instruction).

     This example reads the UNIX file _p_m_a_p._r_o_a_d_s into _p._m_a_p.
     This file may contain all the _p._m_a_p instructions for placing
     the vector map layer _r_o_a_d_s onto the output map.

     EXAMPLE: read pmap.roads

     The user may have created this file because this vector map
     layer is particularly useful for many _p._m_a_p outputs.  By
     using the read option, the user need not enter all the input
     for the vector instruction, but simply read the previously
     prepared file with the correct instructions.


region
     Places the outline of a smaller geographic region on the
     output.

     USAGE:   region regionfile|_l_i_s_t
                color color
                width #
                end

     Geographic region settings are created and saved using
     _g._r_e_g_i_o_n.  The _p._m_a_p _r_e_g_i_o_n option can be used to show an
     outline of a smaller region which was printed on a separate
     run of _p._m_a_p on other user-created maps.

     The user can specify the color and the width (in pixel
     units) of the outline.  The default is a black border of one
     pixel width.

     This example would place a white outline, 2 pixels wide, of
     the geographic region called _f_i_r_e._z_o_n_e_s onto the output map.
     This geographic region would have been created and saved
     using _g._r_e_g_i_o_n.

     EXAMPLE:   region fire.zones
                  color white
                  width 2
                  end


scale
     Selects a scale for the output map.



8                        U.S. Army CERL                 GRASS 4.1






p.map <main>         GRASS Reference Manual          <main> p.map



     USAGE:   scale _s_c_a_l_e

     The scale can be selected either as:

          a relative ratio, e.g. 1:25000;

          an absolute width of the printed map, e.g. 10 inches;

          the number of printed paper panels, e.g. 3 panels;

          the number of miles per inch, e.g. 1 inch equals 4
          miles.

     This example would set the scale of the map to 1 unit =
     25000 units.
     EXAMPLE:   scale 1:25000


setcolor
     Overrides the color assigned to one or more categories of
     the raster map layer.

     USAGE:   setcolor cat(s) color


     This example would set the color for categories 2,5 and 8 of
     the raster map layer _w_a_t_e_r_s_h_e_d_s to white and category 10 to
     green.  (NOTE: no spaces are inserted between the category
     values.)

     EXAMPLE:   raster watersheds
                setcolor 2,5,8 white
                setcolor 10 green

     Of course, _s_e_t_c_o_l_o_r can be requested more than once to
     override the default color for additional categories.  More
     than one category can be changed for each request by listing
     all the category values separated by commas (but with no
     spaces).


setpat
     Assigns a (previously defined) pattern on a raster map layer
     category.

     USAGE:   setpat cat name
       or     setpat _b_u_i_l_t_i_n
       or     setpat _a_l_l

     The user can choose to use: the name of a specific pattern
     created using defpat (see above); the patterns built into
     _p._m_a_p; or all the patterns the user may have created.



GRASS 4.1                U.S. Army CERL                         9






p.map <main>         GRASS Reference Manual          <main> p.map



     This example assigns the vertical pattern created using
     defpat (see example in defpat above) to category 3 of the
     raster map layer _v_e_g_e_t_a_t_i_o_n and the tree pattern (see
     example in defpat above) to category 10.
     EXAMPLE:   raster veg
                setpat 3 vert
                setpat 10 tree


     This example reads a previously prepared UNIX file _h_o_r_i_z._p_a_t
     with the correct defpat instructions for creating a black
     horizontal pattern (see example in defpat above) and assigns
     that pattern to category 5 of the raster map layer _s_o_i_l_s via
     the setpat instruction.
     EXAMPLE:   raster soils
                read horiz.pat
                setpat 5 horiz

     To select the builtin patterns:
     EXAMPLE:   raster soils
                setpat builtin

     To select individual builtin patterns:
     EXAMPLE:   raster soils
                setpat 5 #1
                setpat 10 #2


startpanel
     Specifies at which panel number to begin printing.  Default
     is 0 and would start printing from the first panel.

     EXAMPLE:   startpanel 2

     This example would begin printing at panel 2.


sites
     Selects sites data to be placed on the output map (see
     manual entry for _s._m_e_n_u).

     USAGE:   sites sitemap|_l_i_s_t
                color color
                icon iconfile|_l_i_s_t
                size #
                desc [y|n]
                end

     The user may specify the the color of the sites (see section
     on NAMED COLORS below); the icon to be used to represent the
     presence of a site (see the manual entry for _p._i_c_o_n_s); the
     size of the icon (number of times larger than the size it is

     in the icon file); and whether or not the description
     associated with each site is also to be printed.

     This example would paint a sites map with blue windmills
     (from an icon file created by the user using the _p._i_c_o_n_s
     GRASS command) placed at all windmill locations (from a
     sites list).  These windmills would be two times larger than
     the size of the icon in the icon file and have descriptions
     from the sites list file printed beside them.
     EXAMPLE:   sites windmills
                  color blue
                  icon windmill
                  size 2
                  desc y
                  end


text
     Places text on the map.

     USAGE:   text  east north text
              text  x% y% text
                font fontname
                color color|none
                width #
                hcolor color|none
                hwidth #
                background color|none
                border color|none
                size #
                ref reference point
                xoffset #
                yoffset #
                opaque [y|n]
                end


     The user specifies where the text will be placed by
     providing map coordinates or percentages of the geographic
     region map.  The text follows these coordinates on the same
     instruction line.  More than one line of text can be
     specified by notating the end of a line with \n (e.g.
     USA\nCERL).


     The user can then specify various text features:

     font: cyrilc gothgbt gothgrt gothitt greekc greekcs greekp
     greeks italicc italiccs italict romanc romancs romand romans
     romant scriptc scripts (The default font is romans);

     color (see NAMED COLORS);

p.map <main>         GRASS Reference Manual          <main> p.map



     width of the lines used to draw the text (to make thicker
     letters);

     size as the vertical height of the letters in meters on the
     ground (text size will grow or shrink depending on the scale
     at which the map is painted);

     the highlight color (hcolor) and the width of the highlight
     color (hwidth);

     the text-enclosing-box background color; the text box border
     color;

     ref. This reference point specifies the text handle - what
     part of the text should be placed on the location specified
     by the map coordinates.  Reference points can refer to:
     [lower|upper|center] [left|right|center] of the text to be
     printed;

     yoffset, which provides finer placement of text by shifting
     the text a vertical distance in pixels from the specified
     north.  The vertical offset will shift the location to the
     south if positive, north if negative;

     xoffset, which shifts the text a horizontal distance in
     pixels from the specified east The horizontal offset will
     shift the location east if positive, west if negative;

     whether or not the text should be opaque to vectors.
     Entering no to the opaque option will allow the user to see
     any vectors which go through the text's background box.
     Otherwise, they will end at the box's edge.

     This example would place the text _S_P_E_A_R_F_I_S_H _L_A_N_D _C_O_V_E_R at
     the coordinates E650000 N7365000. The text would be a total
     of 3 pixels wide (2 pixels of red text and 1 pixel black
     highlight), have a white background enclosed in a red box,
     and be 500 meters in size.  The lower right corner of the
     text would be centered over the coordinates provided.  All
     vectors on the map would stop at the border of this text.
     EXAMPLE:   text 650000 7365000 SPEARFISH LAND COVER
                  font romand
                  color red
                  width 2
                  hcolor black
                  hwidth 1
                  background white
                  border red
                  size 500
                  ref lower left
                  opaque y
                  end

vector
     Selects a vector map layer for output.

     USAGE:   vector vectormap|_l_i_s_t
                color [#] color
                width #
                hcolor color
                hwidth #
                masked [y|n]
                style  0-9
                end

     The user can specify the color of the vectors; the width of
     the vectors lines in pixels; the highlight color (hcolor)
     for the vector lines; the width of the highlight color
     (hwidth) in pixels; whether or not the raster map layer is
     to be masked by the current mask (see manual entry _r._m_a_s_k
     for more information on the mask); and the line style.  The
     line style allows the vectors to be dashed in different
     patterns and colors.  This is done by typing a series of
     numbers (0-9) in a desired sequence or pattern.  Colors for
     the numbers (1-9) can be assigned using the color
     instruction.  Blanks and non-digit characters are recognized
     as 0's. Using 0 would allow the colors of the raster map
     layer (or the background color if no raster map layer was
     selected) to show through.

     This example would paint a map of the vector map layer named
     _s_t_r_e_a_m_s.  These streams would be a total of 3 pixels wide
     (the inner two pixels blue and the outer highlight pixel
     white).  The map would not show streams outside of the
     current mask.
     EXAMPLE:   vector streams
                  color blue
                  width 2
                  hcolor white
                  hwidth 1
                  masked y
                  end

     This example would paint a map of the vector map layer
     _r_o_a_d_s.  These roads would be 2 pixels wide and would be
     dashed blank-black-red (the blank areas would show what lies
     under the roads). This map would show roads inside and
     outside of the current mask.
     EXAMPLE:   vector roads
                  width 2
                  style 001122
                  color 1 black
                  color 2 red
                  masked n
                  end

verbose
     Changes the amount of talking _p._m_a_p will do.

     USAGE: verbose [0|1|2]

     A higher value implies more chatter.  The default is 2.
     This example sets the amount of chatter to a minimum.

     EXAMPLE:   verbose 0

     Terminates input and begin painting the map.

     USAGE:   end


NAMED COLORS
     The following are the colors that are accepted by _p._m_a_p:

     aqua black blue brown cyan gray green grey indigo magenta
     orange purple red violet white yellow


ICONS VS. PATTERNS
     Icons and patterns as used in _p._m_a_p are not the same thing.
     Patterns are defined and are normally used to cover those
     extended areas covered by a raster map layer category.  A
     pattern will repeat above, below and adjacent to itself.
     Icons are used to represent a single point.

     Patterns are supported directly within _p._m_a_p using the
     _d_e_f_p_a_t instruction, while icons must be created using the
     _p._i_c_o_n_s program.


EXAMPLE p.map INPUT FILE
     The following is an example of a _p._m_a_p script file. The file
     has been name _s_p_e_a_r._s_o_i_l_s.  For the purposes of
     illustration, the file is in two columns.  This script file
     can be entered at the command line:
          p.map input=spear.soils

INTERACTIVE MODE
     If the user simply enter _p._m_a_p without arguments, then a
     simple prompting session occurs.  Some, but not all of the
     non-interactive requests are available at this level.
