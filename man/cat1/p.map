NAME
     p.map - Hardcopy color map	output utility.
     (GRASS Hardcopy Output Program)

SYNOPSIS
     p.map
     p.map help
     p.map [input=name]	[scale=mapscale]

DESCRIPTION
     p.map produces hardcopy color map products	on your	system's
     color output device.  Output can include a	raster map, any
     number of vector overlays,	site data, text	labels,	and other
     spatial data.

     This program has 2	distincts modes	of operation.  The
     command-line mode requires	the user to prepare a file of
     mapping instructions describing the various spatial and
     textual information to be printed prior to	running	p.map.
     The interactive mode (i.e., no command-line arguments) will
     prompt the	user for items to be mapped and	does not require
     the user to prepare a file	of instructions.

     The command-line parameters are:

     input=name	       File containing mapping instructions.  (or
		       enter input=- to	enter from keyboard).
		       These instructions are described	in detail
		       below.

     scale=mapscale    Scale of	the output map,	 e.g. 1:25000
		       Default:	 1panel

		       This parameter is provided as a
		       convenience.  It	is identical to	the scale
		       mapping instruction described below.


     Note: the user must select	an output device using p.select
     before running p.map.  Also, the preview device can be
     selected to view the output from p.map on the graphics
     monitor instead of	sending	it to a	paper printer.


MAPPING	INSTRUCTIONS
     The mapping instructions allow the	user to	specify	various
     spatial data to be	plotted. These instructions are	normally
     prepared in a regular text	file using a system editor.  Some
     instructions are single line instructions while others are
     multiple line. Multiple line instructions consist of the
     main instruction followed by a subsection of one or more
     additional	instructions.

p.map <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	     <main> p.map



colormode
     Selects the appropriate method to color raster map	layers
     and images.

     USAGE:   colormode	approx|best

     There are two methods:  approximate and best. From	a user
     perspective, approximate can be used for raster map layers
     with few categories, such as soils, and best should be used
     for images	like LANDSAT images or NHAP photos, or maps with
     many categories.  The approximate mode treats each	pixel
     independently, giving it the printer color	that best
     approximates the true color.  The best mode "blends" colors
     from pixel	to pixel using a dithering technique to	simulate
     more colors than the printer can actually print.  The
     default, if unspecified, is best.

     This example would	select the approximate colormode.  The
     assumption	is that	the raster map layer being printed is has
     few colors	or that	the colors would not look good dithered.

     EXAMPLE:	colormode approx


colortable
     Includes the color	table for the raster map layer in the
     legend below the map

     USAGE:   colortable [y|n]

     The color table will display the colors for each raster map
     layer category value and the category label.  To get a color
     table, you	must have previously requested a raster	map
     layer.  Omitting the colortable instruction would result in
     no	color table.  Note:  Be	careful	about asking for color
     tables for	raster map layers which	have many categories,
     such as elevation.	 This could result in the printing of an
     extremely long color table!!!!!

     This example would	print a	color table as part of the legend
     to	the map.
     EXAMPLE:	colortable y



comments
     Prints comments beneath the map .	You may	submit comment
     text line by line during p.map execution or a via a prepared
     comments file.

     USAGE:   comments [commentfile]
	      comments



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			2






p.map <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	     <main> p.map



	      end

     This example prints the comment "This is a	comment" in the
     legend below the map.
     EXAMPLE:	comments
		  This is a comment.
		  end

     This example prints whatever is in	the file veg.comments in
     the legend	below the map.
     EXAMPLE:	raster vegetation
		comments veg.comments
		  end

     Presumably, the file veg.comments contain comments
     pertaining	to the raster map layer	vegetation, such as "This
     map was created by	classifying a LANDSAT TM image".



defpat
     Defines area fill patterns	to be used in the setpat
     instruction.

     USAGE:   defpat name
	       pattern
	      color # color
	      end


     The pattern is given a name on the	defpat instruction line.
     The pattern which follows is composed of a	sequence of
     numbers 0-9 (and blanks, which are	equivalent to 0).  The
     blanks or zeros indicate holes in the pattern where the
     normal category color would show thru. The	other number 1-9
     indicate pattern pixels and can be	assigned any color.  The
     default color for all the digits will be black unless
     specified with the	color instruction.  The	color option will
     begin by entering the word	color followed by one of the
     digits (1-9) in the pattern, followed by one of the NAMED
     COLORS.  This should be repeated for each of the digits
     specified to avoid	using black.  The instruction end
     terminates	the pattern definition.	 Of course, the	user can
     define more patterns by entering more defpat instructions.

     NOTE: Do NOT indent the pattern.  Leading blank spaces will
     be	interpreted as 0's.

     This example creates a black horizontal line pattern.
     EXAMPLE:	defpat horiz
		1
		0



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			3






p.map <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	     <main> p.map



		0
		0
		color 1	black
		end

     This example creates a green vertical line	pattern.
     EXAMPLE:	defpat vert
		1000
		color 1	green
		end

     This example creates a red	diagonal line pattern.
     EXAMPLE:	defpat diag
		00001
		0001
		001
		01
		1
		color 1	red
		end

     This example creates a two-toned tree pattern with	orange
     trunks and	green leaves.
     EXAMPLE:	defpat tree
		     2
		    222
		   22122
		  22 1 22
		     1

			       2
			      222
			     22122
			    22 1 22
			       1
		color 1	orange
		color 2	black
		end


endpanel
     Specifies which panel number to end printing.  The	default
     is	0, and will print all panels from the startpanel to the
     last panel.

     EXAMPLE:	endpanel 4

     This example would	end output at panel 4.


grid
     Overlays a	coordinate grid	onto the output	map.



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			4






p.map <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	     <main> p.map



     USAGE:   grid spacing
		color color
		numbers	# [color]
		end

     The spacing of the	grid is	given (in the geographic
     coordinate	system units) on the main instruction line.  The
     subsection	instructions allow the user to specify the color
     of	the grid lines,	whether	coordinate numbers should appear
     on	the grid lines,	and if they should appear every	grid line
     (1), every	other grid line	(2), etc., and what color the
     numbers should be.	 The defaults are black	grid lines,
     unnumbered.

     This example would	overlay	a green	grid with a spacing of
     10000 meters (for a metered database, like	UTM) onto the
     output map.  Alternate grid lines would be	numbered with red
     numbers.

     EXAMPLE:	grid 10000
		  color	green
		  numbers 2 red
		  end



labels
     Selects a labels file for output (see manual entry	for
     p.labels).

     USAGE:   labels  labelfile|list

     This example would	paint labels from the labels file called
     town.names.  Presumably, these labels would indicate the
     names of towns on the map.

     EXAMPLE:	labels town.names


line
     Draws lines on the	output map.

     USAGE:   line east	north east north
	      line x% y% x% y%
		color color
		width #
		masked [y|n]
		end

     The beginning and ending points of	the line are entered on
     the main instruction.  These points can be	defined	either by
     map coordinates or	by using percentages of	the geographic



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			5






p.map <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	     <main> p.map



     region.  The user may also	specify	line color, width in
     pixels, and if the	line is	to be masked by	the current mask.
     (See manual entry for r.mask for more information on the
     mask.)

     This example would	draw a yellow line from	the point x=10%
     y=80% to the point	x=30% y=70%. This line would be	2 pixels
     wide and would appear even	if there is a mask.

     EXAMPLE:	line 10% 80% 30% 70%
		  color	yellow
		  width	2
		  masked n
		  end

     Of	course,	multiple lines may be drawn with multiple line
     instructions.


outline
     Outlines the areas	of a raster map	layer with a specified
     color.

     USAGE:   outline
		color  color
		end


     Distinct areas of the raster map will be separated	from each
     other visually by drawing a border	(or outline) in	the
     specified color (default: black).	Note: it is important the
     user enter	the instruction	end even if a color is not
     chosen.  (It is hoped that	in the future the outline of a
     different raster map layer	other than the one currently
     being painted may be placed on the	map.)

     This example would	outline	the category areas of the soils
     raster map	layer in grey.
     EXAMPLE:	raster soils
		outline
		color grey
		end


point
     Places additional points or icons on the output map.

     USAGE:   point east north
	      point x% y%
		color color
		icon iconfile|list
		size #



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			6






p.map <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	     <main> p.map



		masked [y|n]
		end

     The point location	is entered in the main instruction line
     by	giving either the map coordinates or by	using percentages
     of	the geographic region.	The user may also specify the
     point color, the icon file	to be used to represent	the point
     location (see the the manual entry	for p.icons), the size of
     the icon in integer multiples of the pattern in the icon
     file, and whether the point is to be masked by the	current
     mask. (See	manual entry for r.mask	for more information on
     the mask.)

     This example would	place a	purple diamond (from icon file
     diamond) at the point (E456000 N7890000).	This diamond
     would be the same size it is in the diamond icon file and
     would not be masked by the	current	mask.

     EXAMPLE:	point 456000 7890000
		  color	purple
		  icon diamond
		  size 1
		  masked n
		  end


     Of	course,	multiple points	may be drawn with multiple point
     instructions.


raster
     Selects a raster map layer	for output.

     USAGE:   raster mapname|list

     For each p.map run, only one raster map layer can be
     requested.	 If no raster map layer	is requested, a
     completely	white map will be produced.  It	can be useful to
     select no raster map layer	in order to provide a white
     background	for vector images.

     This example would	paint a	map of the raster map layer
     soils.
     EXAMPLE:	raster soils



read
     Provides p.map with a previously prepared input stream.

     USAGE:   read previously prepared UNIX file




GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			7






p.map <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	     <main> p.map



     Mapping instructions can be placed	into a file and	read into
     p.map.

     Note: p.map will not search for this file.	 The user must be
     in	the correct directory or specify the full path on the
     read instruction.	(Note to /bin/csh users: ~ won't work
     with this instruction).

     This example reads	the UNIX file pmap.roads into p.map.
     This file may contain all the p.map instructions for placing
     the vector	map layer roads	onto the output	map.

     EXAMPLE: read pmap.roads

     The user may have created this file because this vector map
     layer is particularly useful for many p.map outputs.  By
     using the read option, the	user need not enter all	the input
     for the vector instruction, but simply read the previously
     prepared file with	the correct instructions.


region
     Places the	outline	of a smaller geographic	region on the
     output.

     USAGE:   region regionfile|list
		color color
		width #
		end

     Geographic	region settings	are created and	saved using
     g.region.	The p.map region option	can be used to show an
     outline of	a smaller region which was printed on a	separate
     run of p.map on other user-created	maps.

     The user can specify the color and	the width (in pixel
     units) of the outline.  The default is a black border of one
     pixel width.

     This example would	place a	white outline, 2 pixels	wide, of
     the geographic region called fire.zones onto the output map.
     This geographic region would have been created and	saved
     using g.region.

     EXAMPLE:	region fire.zones
		  color	white
		  width	2
		  end


scale
     Selects a scale for the output map.



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			8






p.map <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	     <main> p.map



     USAGE:   scale scale

     The scale can be selected either as:

	  a relative ratio, e.g. 1:25000;

	  an absolute width of the printed map,	e.g. 10	inches;

	  the number of	printed	paper panels, e.g. 3 panels;

	  the number of	miles per inch,	e.g. 1 inch equals 4
	  miles.

     This example would	set the	scale of the map to 1 unit =
     25000 units.
     EXAMPLE:	scale 1:25000


setcolor
     Overrides the color assigned to one or more categories of
     the raster	map layer.

     USAGE:   setcolor cat(s) color


     This example would	set the	color for categories 2,5 and 8 of
     the raster	map layer watersheds to	white and category 10 to
     green.  (NOTE: no spaces are inserted between the category
     values.)

     EXAMPLE:	raster watersheds
		setcolor 2,5,8 white
		setcolor 10 green

     Of	course,	setcolor can be	requested more than once to
     override the default color	for additional categories.  More
     than one category can be changed for each request by listing
     all the category values separated by commas (but with no
     spaces).


setpat
     Assigns a (previously defined) pattern on a raster	map layer
     category.

     USAGE:   setpat cat name
       or     setpat builtin
       or     setpat all

     The user can choose to use:  the name of a	specific pattern
     created using defpat (see above); the patterns built into
     p.map; or all the patterns	the user may have created.



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University			9






p.map <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	     <main> p.map



     This example assigns the vertical pattern created using
     defpat (see example in defpat above) to category 3	of the
     raster map	layer vegetation and the tree pattern (see
     example in	defpat above) to category 10.
     EXAMPLE:	raster veg
		setpat 3 vert
		setpat 10 tree


     This example reads	a previously prepared UNIX file	horiz.pat
     with the correct defpat instructions for creating a black
     horizontal	pattern	(see example in	defpat above) and assigns
     that pattern to category 5	of the raster map layer	soils via
     the setpat	instruction.
     EXAMPLE:	raster soils
		read horiz.pat
		setpat 5 horiz

     To	select the builtin patterns:
     EXAMPLE:	raster soils
		setpat builtin

     To	select individual builtin patterns:
     EXAMPLE:	raster soils
		setpat 5 #1
		setpat 10 #2


startpanel
     Specifies at which	panel number to	begin printing.	 Default
     is	0 and would start printing from	the first panel.

     EXAMPLE:	startpanel 2

     This example would	begin printing at panel	2.


sites
     Selects sites data	to be placed on	the output map (see
     manual entry for s.menu).

     USAGE:   sites sitemap|list
		color color
		icon iconfile|list
		size #
		desc [y|n]
		end

     The user may specify the the color	of the sites (see section
     on	NAMED COLORS below); the icon to be used to represent the
     presence of a site	(see the manual	entry for p.icons); the
     size of the icon (number of times larger than the size it is



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University		       10






p.map <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	     <main> p.map



     in	the icon file);	and whether or not the description
     associated	with each site is also to be printed.

     This example would	paint a	sites map with blue windmills
     (from an icon file	created	by the user using the p.icons
     GRASS command) placed at all windmill locations (from a
     sites list).  These windmills would be two	times larger than
     the size of the icon in the icon file and have descriptions
     from the sites list file printed beside them.
     EXAMPLE:	sites windmills
		  color	blue
		  icon windmill
		  size 2
		  desc y
		  end


text
     Places text on the	map.

     USAGE:   text  east north text
	      text  x% y% text
		font fontname
		color color|none
		width #
		hcolor color|none
		hwidth #
		background color|none
		border color|none
		size #
		ref reference point
		xoffset	#
		yoffset	#
		opaque [y|n]
		end


     The user specifies	where the text will be placed by
     providing map coordinates or percentages of the geographic
     region map.  The text follows these coordinates on	the same
     instruction line.	More than one line of text can be
     specified by notating the end of a	line with \n (e.g.
     USA\nCERL).


     The user can then specify various text features:

     font: cyrilc gothgbt gothgrt gothitt greekc greekcs greekp
     greeks italicc italiccs italict romanc romancs romand romans
     romant scriptc scripts (The default font is romans);

     color (see	NAMED COLORS);



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University		       11






p.map <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	     <main> p.map



     width of the lines	used to	draw the text (to make thicker
     letters);

     size as the vertical height of the	letters	in meters on the
     ground (text size will grow or shrink depending on	the scale
     at	which the map is painted);

     the highlight color (hcolor) and the width	of the highlight
     color (hwidth);

     the text-enclosing-box background color; the text box border
     color;

     ref. This reference point specifies the text handle - what
     part of the text should be	placed on the location specified
     by	the map	coordinates.  Reference	points can refer to:
     [lower|upper|center] [left|right|center] of the text to be
     printed;

     yoffset, which provides finer placement of	text by	shifting
     the text a	vertical distance in pixels from the specified
     north.  The vertical offset will shift the	location to the
     south if positive,	north if negative;

     xoffset, which shifts the text a horizontal distance in
     pixels from the specified east The	horizontal offset will
     shift the location	east if	positive, west if negative;

     whether or	not the	text should be opaque to vectors.
     Entering no to the	opaque option will allow the user to see
     any vectors which go through the text's background	box.
     Otherwise,	they will end at the box's edge.

     This example would	place the text SPEARFISH LAND COVER at
     the coordinates E650000 N7365000. The text	would be a total
     of	3 pixels wide (2 pixels	of red text and	1 pixel	black
     highlight), have a	white background enclosed in a red box,
     and be 500	meters in size.	 The lower right corner	of the
     text would	be centered over the coordinates provided.  All
     vectors on	the map	would stop at the border of this text.
     EXAMPLE:	text 650000 7365000 SPEARFISH LAND COVER
		  font romand
		  color	red
		  width	2
		  hcolor black
		  hwidth 1
		  background white
		  border red
		  size 500
		  ref lower left
		  opaque y
		  end



GRASS 4.2		Baylor University		       12






p.map <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	     <main> p.map



vector
     Selects a vector map layer	for output.

     USAGE:   vector vectormap|list
		color [#] color
		width #
		hcolor color
		hwidth #
		masked [y|n]
		style  0-9
		end

     The user can specify the color of the vectors; the	width of
     the vectors lines in pixels; the highlight	color (hcolor)
     for the vector lines; the width of	the highlight color
     (hwidth) in pixels; whether or not	the raster map layer is
     to	be masked by the current mask (see manual entry	r.mask
     for more information on the mask);	and the	line style.  The
     line style	allows the vectors to be dashed	in different
     patterns and colors.  This	is done	by typing a series of
     numbers (0-9) in a	desired	sequence or pattern.  Colors for
     the numbers (1-9) can be assigned using the color
     instruction.  Blanks and non-digit	characters are recognized
     as	0's. Using 0 would allow the colors of the raster map
     layer (or the background color if no raster map layer was
     selected) to show through.

     This example would	paint a	map of the vector map layer named
     streams.  These streams would be a	total of 3 pixels wide
     (the inner	two pixels blue	and the	outer highlight	pixel
     white).  The map would not	show streams outside of	the
     current mask.
     EXAMPLE:	vector streams
		  color	blue
		  width	2
		  hcolor white
		  hwidth 1
		  masked y
		  end

     This example would	paint a	map of the vector map layer
     roads.  These roads would be 2 pixels wide	and would be
     dashed blank-black-red (the blank areas would show	what lies
     under the roads). This map	would show roads inside	and
     outside of	the current mask.
     EXAMPLE:	vector roads
		  width	2
		  style	001122
		  color	1 black
		  color	2 red
		  masked n
		  end

verbose
     Changes the amount	of talking p.map will do.

     USAGE: verbose [0|1|2]

     A higher value implies more chatter.  The default is 2.
     This example sets the amount of chatter to	a minimum.

     EXAMPLE:	verbose	0


end
     Terminates	input and begin	painting the map.

     USAGE:   end


NAMED COLORS
     The following are the colors that are accepted by p.map:

     aqua black	blue brown cyan	gray green grey	indigo magenta
     orange purple red violet white yellow


ICONS VS. PATTERNS
     Icons and patterns	as used	in p.map are not the same thing.
     Patterns are defined and are normally used	to cover those
     extended areas covered by a raster	map layer category.  A
     pattern will repeat above,	below and adjacent to itself.
     Icons are used to represent a single point.

     Patterns are supported directly within p.map using	the
     defpat instruction, while icons must be created using the
     p.icons program.


EXAMPLE	p.map INPUT FILE
     The following is an example of a p.map script file. The file
     has been name spear.soils.	 For the purposes of
     illustration, the file is in two columns.	This script file
     can be entered at the command line:
	  p.map	input=spear.soils

			    (cont.)

	hcolor white	    001
	hwidth 1	    01
	masked y	    1
	end		       color 1 red

INTERACTIVE MODE
     If	the user simply	enter p.map without arguments, then a
     simple prompting session occurs.  Some, but not all of the
     non-interactive requests are available at this level.
