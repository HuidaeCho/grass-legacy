NAME
     r.in.ppm - Converts an ASCII/BINARY PPM image file to a
     GRASS raster file.
     (GRASS Raster Data Import Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.in.ppm [-vb] input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     This program converts a PPM raster file to a GRASS raster
     file.  Output is placed in the /cell directory under the
     user's current GRASS mapset. Optionally, the user is asked
     to enter the maximum number of levels for each band; The
     default value is 20 (= 20 x 20 x 20 = 8000 colors). If the
     number of colors in the PPM raster file is greater than the
     maximum number of colors, a quantized color table is created
     and each color of the PPM raster file assigned to the
     nearest available color. Optionally, the program creates 3
     separate raster maps of the (true) red, green and blue
     levels. Currently PPM ASCII and PPM BINARY (PBM) formats are
     supported.

OPTIONS
Flag:
     Verbose mode Create 3 separate raster maps of the (true)
     R/G/B levels

Parameters:
     Name of an existing PPM raster file to be imported.  Name to
     be assigned to resultant binary raster map layer.	Max
     number of levels for R/G/B.  options: 1-256 default: 20 (=
     8000 colors)

NOTES
     R/G/B levels: each output raster map layer is given a linear
     gray scale color table. Each output raster map layer is
     assigned the user-specified output with (.r, .g, .b) suffix.

     The user should adjust boundary coordinates stored in the
     cell header after import using r.support and parser
