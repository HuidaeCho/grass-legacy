NAME
     d.scale - Overlays a bar scale and north arrow for the
     current geographic region at a user-defined location in the
     active display frame.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.scale
     d.scale help
     d.scale [-m] [bcolor=name] [tcolor=name] [at=x,y]

DESCRIPTION
     d.scale overlays a bar scale and north arrow for the current
     geographic region at a user-defined location in the active
     display frame.  The scale and north arrow are proportioned
     to fit in the active frame when placed along the frame's
     left edge.

     The user can specify the location of the scale and north
     arrow interactively (using a mouse), or provide the
     geographic coordinates at which they will be placed.  The
     scale and north arrow will only overwrite those portions of
     the graphics display that lie directly beneath them.

     The user can also specify the colors in which the scale and
     north arrow will be drawn.  By default, if unspecified by
     the user, a white scale and north arrow will be displayed on
     a black background.

OPTIONS
     The user can run this program either non-interactively or
     interactively.  The program will be run non-interactively if
     the user specifies program parameter values and desired flag
     settings on the command line, using the form:

          d.scale [-m] [bcolor=name] [tcolor=name] [at=x,y]

     If at least one parameter value is given on the command line
     and the -m flag is not set, the program will be run non-
     interactively; any other parameter values left unspecified
     on the command line will be set equal to their default
     values (see below).  Alternately, the user can simply type
     d.scale on the command line, without program arguments.  In
     this case, the user will be prompted for needed parameter
     values and the flag setting using the standard GRASS parser
     interface described in the manual entry for parser.  If the
     user sets the -m flag, d.scale will expect the user to
     designate the scale's location interactively, using the
     mouse.

d.scale              GRASS Reference Manual               d.scale



     -m                Use the mouse to interactively place the
                       location of the scale and north arrow.


     Parameters:

     bcolor=name       Set the background color underlying the
                       scale and north arrow to name.
                       Options:  red, orange, yellow, green,
                       blue, indigo, violet, gray, brown,
                       magenta, white, and black
                       Default:  black

     tcolor=name       Set the foreground color in which the
                       text, scale, and north arrow are displayed
                       to name.
                       Options:  Same as bcolor colors.
                       Default:  white

     at=x,y            The map easting (x) and northing (y)
                       geographic coordinates designating the
                       location at which the upper left corner of
                       the scale is to be placed.  The user
                       should choose geographic coordinates
                       located within the current geographic
                       region (see d.where and g.region for these
                       coordinates).
                       Default:  0.0,0.0

NOTES
     d.scale assumes that layer units are in meters.

     The scale that d.scale generates is probably not suitable
     for very tiny maps (in small display frames).
