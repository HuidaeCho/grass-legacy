GRASS VERSION
     4.x

SYNOPSIS
     r.le.trace

     r.le.trace help

     r.le.trace [-npt] map=name]

DESCRIPTION
     When sampling the whole map (sam=W), the r.le.trace program
     can be used to do three things: (1) display the boundary of
     each patch and show how the boundary is traced, (2) display
     the attribute, size, perimeter, and shape indices for each
     patch, and (3) save these data in an output file.

Flags:
     Output map 'num' with patch numbers.  Include sampling area
     boundary as perimeter.  Use 4 neighbor tracing instead of 8
     neighbor.

Parameters:
     Raster map to be analyzed.	 Name of output file to store
     patch data.
