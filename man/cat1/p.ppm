NAME
     p.ppm - Reads portable pixmap (ppm) files created by PPM
     utilities.
     (GRASS Paint/Print Program)

SYNOPSIS
     p.ppm
     p.ppm help
     p.ppm [-f] [input=name]

DESCRIPTION
     This program, p.ppm, reads a user-specified portable pixmap
     (ppm) file and outputs it to the currently selected printer
     (see p.select).  The input ppm file should be one that has
     been created using the PPM utilities developed by Jeff
     Poskanzer.  These utilities can import various image formats
     (including SUN raster, X Windows pixmaps, and others) into
     the PPM formats ppm (color pixmaps), pgm (grey scale maps),
     and pbm (black and white bit-maps).

     If the image doesn't fit the output device, it won't get
     printed.  If you want the image printed (but clipped), use
     the p.ppm -f option, or scale the input using ppmscale, or
     rotate the image using ppmrotate (if it will fit that way --
     otherwise you might have to scale it as well).  If the image
     doesn't fit, p.ppm will tell you what scaling value to enter
     to ppmscale that will make it fit.


EXAMPLES
     If the user is running GRASS on a SUN machine, the following
     command could be used to send a monitor screen image to the
     printer:

          screendump | rasttoppm | p.ppm

     If you are running suntools, the user might type:

          sleep 10; screendump | rasttoppm | ppmrotate 90 | p.ppm

     The UNIX sleep command allows you time to arrange the frames
     before the screen dump starts.  The ppmrotate is usually
     needed because the SUN screens are wider than they are long
     (and wider than 1024 pixels - which is the width of most of
     our printers).

     If you are running X, the user might type:

          xwd | xwdtoppm | ppmrotate 90 | p.ppm

NOTES
     This program only supports the ppm binary format (P6).

     Maximum color level is 255.  If the ppm file has more color
     levels, use ppmcscale to reduce the number of colors.

     No scaling is done.  Use ppmscale to change image size.

     No rotation is done.  Use ppmrotate to rotate the image.
