NAME
     r.basins.fill - Generates a raster map layer showing
     watershed subbasins.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.basins.fill
     r.basins.fill help
     r.basins.fill number=value c_map=name t_map=name result=name

DESCRIPTION
     r.basins.fill generates a raster map layer depicting
     subbasins, based on input raster map layers for the coded
     stream network (where each channel segment has been "coded"
     with a unique category value) and for the ridges within a
     given watershed.  The raster map layer depicting ridges
     should include the ridge which defines the perimeter of the
     watershed.  The coded stream network can be generated as
     part of the r.watershed program, but the map layer of ridges
     will need to be created by hand, either through digitizing
     done in v.digit, or through the on-screen digitizing option
     accessible within d.display or d.digit.

     The resulting output raster map layer will code the
     subbasins with category values matching those of the channel
     segments passing through them.  A user-supplied number of
     passes through the data is made in an attempt to fill in
     these subbasins.  If the resulting map layer from this
     program appears to have holes within a subbasin, the program
     should be rerun with a higher number of passes.

     The user can run r.basins.fill either interactively or non-
     interactively.  If the user simply types r.basins.fill
     without other arguments on the command line, the program
     will prompt the user for the needed parameters using the
     standard GRASS parser interface (see manual entry for
     parser).

     If the user wishes to run the program non-interactively, the
     following parameter values must be specified on the command
     line:


     Parameters:

     number=value      The number of passes to be made through
                       the dataset.

     c_map=name        The coded stream network file name.

     t_map=name        The thinned ridge network file name.

     result=name       The resultant watershed partition file
                       name.

NOTES
     The current geographic region setting is ignored.  Instead,
     the geographic region for the entire input stream's map
     layer is used.
