NAME
     nviz - Visualization and animation tool for GRASS data

SYNOPSIS
     nviz
     nviz [ -q ] [ path=dir ] [ elevation=name [ ,name,...  ] ]
	  [ vector=name [ ,name,...  ] ]
	  [ sites=name [ ,name,...  ] ]


DESCRIPTION
     nviz organizes several useful tools for combining and
     visualizing GRASS raster, vector and site files.  In
     particular, nviz provides a detailed user interface with
     several panels used for specifying various options.  The
     user may specify arbitrary combinations of raster maps,
     vector maps, and site maps.  The attributes associated with
     each map (such as color, masking, line width, etc.) may be
     modified independently.  Also, cut-planes may be used to
     display an interpolated cross section of a set of raster
     maps.  nviz emphasizes a flexible and natural viewing
     mechanism allowing the user to modify view parameters such
     as camera position, surface exaggeration, display
     resolution, lighting models, and light position.  Lastly,
     nviz supports an animation and scripting mechanism for
     building visualizations of sequences of GRASS data.  The
     scripting mechanism may be used to record and playback any
     user session.  Other miscellaneous features include: a
     facility for querying map displays for information, and
     image processing tools which allow the placement of labels
     and scales on the display.

OPTIONS
     The initial set of files used by nviz may be specified by
     providing file arguments for elevation, vector and sites.
     If the user specifies program arguments on the command line,
     the program will start with the given set of files.
     Alternatively, the user can simply type nviz on the command
     line and the program will ask for parameter values and flag
     settings interactively, using the standard GRASS parser
     interface.


     Flags:

     -q	       Quickstart.  Skip over the usual GRASS parser
	       interface and start nviz.  Ignores any file
	       parameters which may have been specified on the
	       command line.

     Parameters:


     path=dir			   Search for additional panels
				   in the specified directory.


     elevation=name[,name,...]	   Use the given list of existing
				   raster files as input.


     vector=name[,name,...]	   Use the given list of existing
				   vector files as input.


     sites=name[,name,...]	   Use the given list of existing
				   sites files as input.


PANELS
     nviz features are presented to the user using "panels".  A
     panel encapsulates some functionality and provides an
     interface for users to access this functionality.	For
     example, nviz is distributed with panels for manipulating
     surfaces, vector files, light sources, and so on.	In
     addition to these default panels, nviz may also be
     configured to load application specific panels.

     In addition to the default panels, nviz can be instructed to
     load additional panels by either using the path option (see
     above) or by setting the GRASS resource Nviz_PanelPath to
     the appropriate list of directories.  Any directory
     specified as a path directory must contain a panelIndex file
     which names the panels stored in that directory.  Panel
     creation and panelIndex files are described elsewhere.

GRASS RESOURCE SETTINGS
     Nviz_PanelPath		   Specifies a list of
				   directories containing
				   additional panels (see
				   PANELS).


     Nviz_AutoSurfColors	   If set to true then any
				   surface loaded from the
				   surface panel will have the
				   color attribute set to the map
				   used to specify topology.
				   This is the default behavior.

NOTES
     Currently, nviz must be invoked from within GRASS
     (preferably version 4.2).	That is, start GRASS then invoke
     nviz from the GRASS shell.

     nviz is built on top of the Tcl/Tk environment.  Be sure you
     have at least Tcl 7.3 or later and Tk 3.6 or later and that
     appropriate environment variables are set correctly.

DIAGNOSTICS
     ERROR: LOCATION_NAME not set
	  The program was run outside of GRASS.

     Tcl_AppInit failed: can't find /usr/local/lib/tcl/init.tcl;
     perhaps you need to install Tcl or set your TCL_LIBRARY
     environment variable?
	  Tcl not installed correctly or TCL_LIBRARY environment
	  variable not set correctly.

     Tcl_AppInit failed: can't find /usr/local/lib/tk/tk.tcl;
     perhaps you need to install Tk or set your TK_LIBRARY
     environment variable?
	  Tk not installed correctly or TK_LIBRARY environment
	  variable not set correctly.

     Usage:
      nviz [-q] [elevation=name[,name,...]]
	    [vector=name[,name,...]]
	    [sites=name[,name,...]]
	  Invalid options were specified on the command line.
