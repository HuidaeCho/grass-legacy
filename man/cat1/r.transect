NAME
     r.transect - Outputs raster map layer values lying along
     user-defined transect line(s).
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.transect
     r.transect help
     r.transect  map=name [result=type] [width=value]
        line=east,north,azimuth,distance[,east,north,azimuth,distance,...]

DESCRIPTION
     This progream outputs, in ASCII, the values in a raster map
     which lie along one or more user-defined transect lines.
     The transects are described by their starting coordinates,
     azimuth, and distance.  The transects may be single-cell
     wide lines, or multiple-cell wide lines.  The output, for
     each transect, may be the values at each of the cells, or a
     single aggregate value (e.g., average or median value).

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     map=name          Name of an existing raster map layer to be
                       queried.

     result=type       Type of results to be output.
                       Options:  raw, median, average
                       Default:  raw

                       If raw results are output, each of the
                       category values assigned to cells falling
                       along the transect are output.  Median and
                       average results output a single value per
                       transect:  average outputs the average
                       category value of all cells along the
                       transect;  median outputs the median
                       category value of these cells.

     line=east,north,azimuth,distance[,east,north,azimuth,distance,...]
                       A definition of (each) transect line,
                       specified by the geographic coordinates of
                       its starting point (easting, northing),
                       the angle and direction of its travel
                       (azimuth), and its distance (distance).

                       The azimuth is an angle, in degrees,
                       measured to the east of north.  The
                       distance is in map units (meters for a
                       metered database, like UTM).

     width=value       Profile width,  in cells (odd number).

                       Default:  1

                       Wider transects can be specified by
                       setting the width to 3, 5, 7, etc.  The
                       transects are then formed as rectangles 3,
                       5, 7, etc., cells wide.

OUTPUT FORMAT
     The output from this command is printed to standard output
     in ASCII.  The format of the output varies slightly
     depending on the type of result requested.  The first number
     printed is the number of cells associated with the transect.
     For raw output, this number is followed by the individual
     cell values.  For average and median output, this number is
     followed by a single value (i.e., the average or the median
     value).

     The following examples use the elevation.dem raster map
     layer in the spearfish sample data set distributed with
     GRASS 4.0.  (To reproduce these examples, first set the
     geographic region as shown:

          g.region rast=elevation.dem


          Single-cell transect:

               r.transect map=elevation.dem
               line=593655,4917280,45,100

               4 1540 1551 1557 1550


          3-cell wide transect:

               r.transect map=elevation.dem
               line=593655,4917280,45,100 width=3

               22 1556 1538 1525 1570 1555 1540 1528 1578 1565
               1551 1536 1523 1569 1557 1546 1533 1559 1550 1542
               1552 1543 1548

               (Output appears as multiple lines here, but is
               really one line)


          3-cell wide transect average:

               r.transect map=elevation.dem
               line=593655,4917280,45,100 width=3 result=average

NOTES
     This program is a front-end to the r.profile program.  It
     simply converts the azimuth and distance to an ending
     coordinate and then runs r.profile.
