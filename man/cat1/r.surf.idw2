NAME
     r.surf.idw2 - Surface generation program.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.surf.idw2 input=name output=name [npoints=count]

DESCRIPTION
     r.surf.idw2 fills a raster matrix with interpolated values
     generated from a set of irregularly spaced data points using
     numerical approximation (weighted averaging) techniques.
     The interpolated value of a cell is determined by values of
     nearby data points and the distance of the cell from those
     input points.  In comparison with other methods, numerical
     approximation allows representation of more complex surfaces
     (particularly those with anomalous features), restricts the
     spatial influence of any errors, and generates the
     interpolated surface from the data points.	 It is the most
     appropriate method to apply to most spatial data.

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies the values of needed program parameters and any
     desired optional parameter values on the command line, using
     the form:

	  r.surf.idw2 input=name output=name [npoints=count]

     Alternately, the user can simply type r.surf.idw2 on the
     command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for parameter values using the
     standard GRASS user interface described in the manual entry
     for parser.

     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of an input raster map layer that
		       contains a set of irregularly spaced data
		       values; i.e., some cells contain known
		       data values while the rest contain zero
		       (0).

     output=name       Name to be assigned to the new output
		       raster map layer containing a smooth
		       surface generated from the known data
		       values in the input map layer.

     npoints=count     The number of points to use for
		       interpolation.  The default is to use the
		       12 nearest points when interpolating the
		       value for a particular cell.
		       Default:	 12

NOTES
     The amount of memory used by this program is related to the
     number of non-zero data values in the input map layer.  If
     the input raster map layer is very dense (i.e., contains
     many non-zero data points), the program may not be able to
     get all the memory it needs from the system.  The time
     required to execute increases with the number of input data
     points.

     If the user has a mask set, then interpolation is only done
     for those cells that fall within the mask.	 However, all
     non-zero data points in the input layer are used even if
     they fall outside the mask.

     This program does not work with latitude/longitude data
     bases.  Another surface generation program, named
     r.surf.idw, should be used with latitude/longitude data
     bases.

     The user should refer to the manual entries for r.surf.idw,
     r.surf.contour, and s.surf.idw to compare this surface
     generation program with others available in GRASS.
