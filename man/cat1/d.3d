DESCRIPTION
     _d._3_d displays three-dimensional graphic images based on
     GRASS raster map layers.  The user identifies the viewing
     point, the line of sight, a vertical exaggeration factor,
     the viewing angle (field of view), the frequency and color
     of vector grid lines to appear in the display, the map to be
     displayed in 3-d, and the map whose category values are to
     be used as elevation values in the 3-dimensional image.

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies all needed parameter values and flag settings on
     the command line.  Alternately, the user can simply type
     d.3d on the command line;  in this case, the program will
     prompt the user for parameter values and flag settings using
     the standard interface described in the manual entry for
     _p_a_r_s_e_r.

     Three-dimensional images can also be generated through the
     GRASS _d._d_i_s_p_l_a_y program.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     -l                Display _l_i_n_e_s only, without displaying the
                       raster base _m_a_p.

     -0                Show zero elevations.

     -_a                Each grid-cell is rendered using four
                       elevation coordinates: one for each
                       corner.  By default, each corner takes the
                       value of the grid-cell to the lower right.
                       With the -a option each corner is
                       calculated to be an average of the four
                       bordering cell elevation values.


     Parameters:

     map=_n_a_m_e          The raster map layer used to generate the

d.3d <main>          GRASS Reference Manual           <main> d.3d



                       color shown in the 3-d output (i.e., the
                       map whose x and y values will be
                       displayed, using the z values present in
                       the _e_l_e_v_a_t_i_o_n map layer.)

     elevation=_n_a_m_e    The raster map used to generate the
                       texture in the 3-d image (i.e., the map
                       whose category values will become the
                       elevation values in the 3-d map
                       displayed).  This need not be an elevation
                       map layer, although elevation is commonly
                       used.
                       Default:  elevation

     from_coordinate=_x,_y,_z
                       Coordinates of the viewing point, given
                       as:  _n_o_r_t_h_i_n_g,_e_a_s_t_i_n_g,_e_l_e_v_a_t_i_o_n.  The
                       default _f_r_o_m__c_o_o_r_d_i_n_a_t_e value is
                       appropriate for the spearfish sample data
                       set.
                       Default:  Calculated at run-time just
                       south-west of the south-west corner.

     to_coordinate=_x,_y,_z
                       Coordinates of center of view, given as:
                       _n_o_r_t_h_i_n_g,_e_a_s_t_i_n_g,_e_l_e_v_a_t_i_o_n.  The default
                       _t_o__c_o_o_r_d_i_n_a_t_e value is appropriate for the
                       spearfish sample data set.
                       Default:  Calculated at run-time as the
                       center of the image

     exaggeration=_v_a_l_u_e
                       Vertical exaggeration factor.  This value
                       is multiplied by the "elevation" values
                       (category values) in the _e_l_e_v_a_t_i_o_n map
                       layer.  As the vertical coordinates are
                       exaggerated, the elevation (z) value of
                       the center of view (the _t_o__c_o_o_r_d_i_n_a_t_e)
                       should be increased.
                       Default:  2.0

     lines=_v_a_l_u_e       North-south and east-west trending lines
                       can be drawn on the 3-d image output, to
                       enhance the 3-d effect.  The _l_i_n_e_s value
                       specifies the number of rows and columns
                       to skip between lines.  0 means "display
                       no lines".  Lines will be drawn in the
                       _c_o_l_o_r stated.  The user can elect to only
                       display these lines, without displaying
                       the _m_a_p, by setting the -l flag.
                       Default:  1

d.3d <main>          GRASS Reference Manual           <main> d.3d



     field=_v_a_l_u_e       The field of view (viewing angle) in the
                       image, stated in degrees.
                       Default:  30

     color=_n_a_m_e        Color of vector _l_i_n_e_s drawn on the output.
                       Options:  color, white, red, orange,
                       yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, gray,
                       black
                       Default:  gray

     The resulting three-dimensional image is drawn in the active
     frame on the graphics monitor.  The user should select and
     erase the full graphics monitor frame before running _d._3_d to
     prepare the screen for graphics.  Refer to the GRASS program
     _3_d._v_i_e_w._s_h for a demonstration of the _d._3_d program.

INTERACTIVE MODE
     The interactive mode prompts for the raster map to be
     rendered, the raster map to be queried for elevation
     information, and an optionally saved set of saved viewing
     parameters.  The user is then presented with a form in which
     the options can be modified.

     It is suggested that the following procedure be used to
     efficiently find the correct viewing parameters.  Start with
     a gross grid (by default, a resolution is chosen which
     limits the total number of rows and columns), display lines
     only, set line colors to "color" (lines take their color
     from the map), set the box color to something other than
     "none", and use the default viewing coordinates.  Experiment
     with the viewing coordinates until the map is positioned in
     a desireable configuration.  When the map is lined up
     correctly, set the display resolution as low as you like for
     a final image.


BUGS
     Several additions to this program have been suggested.
     These include the following:
     1) Border the image with a visually appealing curtain.
     2) Add x,y,z coordinates and scale information to the
     displayed 3-d image.
     3) Provide a graphic-oriented user interface for identifying
     viewing parameters.
     4) Display output more quickly by doing mathematics in
     integers.
     5) Add the option of plotting vector map layers.
