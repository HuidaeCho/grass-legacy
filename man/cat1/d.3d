NAME
     d.3d - Displays three-dimensional images based on raster map
     layers.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.3d
     d.3d help
     d.3d [-l0an] map=name elevation=name [from_coordinate=x,y,z]
     [to_coordinate=x,y,z] [exaggeration=value] [lines=value]
     [field=value] [color=name] [box=name]

DESCRIPTION
     d.3d displays three-dimensional graphic images based on
     GRASS raster map layers.  The user identifies the viewing
     point, the line of sight, a vertical exaggeration factor,
     the viewing angle (field of view), the frequency and color
     of vector grid lines to appear in the display, the map to be
     displayed in 3-d, and the map whose category values are to
     be used as elevation values in the 3-dimensional image.

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies all needed parameter values and flag settings on
     the command line. Alternately, the user can simply type d.3d
     on the command line; in this case, the program will prompt
     the user for parameter values and flag settings using the
     standard interface described in the manual entry for parser.

     Three-dimensional images can also be generated through the
     GRASS d.display program.

OPTIONS
Flags:
     Display lines only, without displaying the raster base map.
     Show zero elevations.  Each grid-cell is rendered using four
     elevation coordinates: one for each corner. By default, each
     corner takes the value of the grid-cell to the lower right.
     With the -a option each corner is calculated to be an
     average of the four bordering cell elevation values.  Show
     null elevations.

Parameters:
     The raster map layer used to generate the color shown in the
     3-d output (i.e., the map whose x and y values will be
     displayed, using the z values present in the elevation map
     layer.)  The raster map used to generate the texture in the
     3-d image (i.e., the map whose category values will become
     the elevation values in the 3-d map displayed). This need
     not be an elevation map layer, although elevation is
     commonly used.
     Default: elevation Coordinates of the viewing point, given
     as: northing,easting,elevation.  The default from_coordinate

     value is appropriate for the spearfish sample data set.
     Default: Calculated at run-time just south-west of the
     south-west corner.	 Coordinates of center of view, given as:
     northing,easting,elevation.  The default to_coordinate value
     is appropriate for the spearfish sample data set.
     Default: Calculated at run-time as the center of the image
     Vertical exaggeration factor. This value is multiplied by
     the "elevation" values (category values) in the elevation
     map layer.	 As the vertical coordinates are exaggerated, the
     elevation (z) value of the center of view (the
     to_coordinate) should be increased.
     Default: 2.0 North-south and east-west trending lines can be
     drawn on the 3-d image output, to enhance the 3-d effect.
     The lines value specifies the number of rows and columns to
     skip between lines.  0 means "display no lines". Lines will
     be drawn in the color stated.  The user can elect to only
     display these lines, without displaying the map, by setting
     the -l flag.
     Default: 1 The field of view (viewing angle) in the image,
     stated in degrees.
     Default: 30 Color of vector lines drawn on the output.
     Options: color, white, red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
     indigo, violet, gray, black
     Default: gray

     The resulting three-dimensional image is drawn in the active
     frame on the graphics monitor. The user should select and
     erase the full graphics monitor frame before running d.3d to
     prepare the screen for graphics.  Refer to the GRASS program
     3d.view.sh for a demonstration of the d.3d program.

INTERACTIVE MODE
     The interactive mode prompts for the raster map to be
     rendered, the raster map to be queried for elevation
     information, and an optionally saved set of saved viewing
     parameters. The user is then presented with a form in which
     the options can be modified.

     It is suggested that the following procedure be used to
     efficiently find the correct viewing parameters. Start with
     a gross grid (by default, a resolution is chosen which
     limits the total number of rows and columns), display lines
     only, set line colors to "color" (lines take their color
     from the map), set the box color to something other than
     "none", and use the default viewing coordinates. Experiment
     with the viewing coordinates until the map is positioned in
     a desireable configuration. When the map is lined up
     correctly, set the display resolution as low as you like for
     a final image.

BUGS
     Several additions to this program have been suggested. These

     include the following:
      Border the image with a visually appealing curtain.
      Add x,y,z coordinates and scale information to the
     displayed 3-d image.
      Provide a graphic-oriented user interface for identifying
     viewing parameters.
      Display output more quickly by doing mathematics in
     integers.
      Add the option of plotting vector map layers.
