NAME
     d.ask  - Prompts the user to select a GRASS data base file
     from among files displayed in a menu on the graphics
     monitor.
     (GRASS File Management Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.ask help
     d.ask element=name,description [prompt="message"]

DESCRIPTION
     d.ask is designed for shell scripts that need to prompt the
     user for the name of a data base file in the user's current
     GRASS mapset search path.  After d.ask is invoked with
     needed parameters, the mouse becomes active and a menu
     containing files of the specified element type is displayed
     on the user's graphics monitor.  The user is prompted by the
     prompt "message" to select one of the listed file names with
     the mouse.  Specifically, the query that appears to the user
     takes the form:

          Double click on the   prompt "message"
          Double click here to cancel

          (A list of files of the specified element type from each of the mapsets
          listed in the user's mapset search path is also displayed.)

     After the user responds, the mouse is deactivated and the
     displayed menu is erased from the screen (leaving any
     underlying materials on display intact).  Three lines are
     written to standard output (the user's terminal screen):

          name=file_name
          mapset=mapset_name
          fullname=file_name@mapset_name

     Parameters:

     element=name,description
                         Name of a GRASS data base element,
                         followed by a one word description of
                         the element.  GRASS data base elements
                         are mapset subdirectories;  these
                         include: bdlg, cats, cell, cell_misc,
                         cellhd, colr, colr2, dig, dig_ascii,
                         dig_att, dig_cats, dig_plus, dlg, group,
                         hist, icons, noise, paint, site_lists,
                         and windows.  The description will be
                         used to display an error message to the
                         screen if no files of the named element
                         type exist in the user's mapset search
                         path.  The prompt "message" will appear

d.ask                GRASS Reference Manual                 d.ask



                         in the pop-up menu displayed on the
                         user's graphics monitor.  The files
                         listed in the menu will be of the
                         specified element type, and exist in
                         mapsets listed in the user's current
                         mapset search path.

     prompt="message"    A brief message with which the user will
                         be prompted.  If this message contains
                         more than one word, it should be
                         enclosed within double quotes ("").  It
                         is a non-selectable message displayed in
                         the menu bar of a pop-up menu.
                         Selectable items in the displayed menu
                         include a cancel option and any of the
                         files in the mapset subdirectory name in
                         the user's mapset search path.

EXAMPLE
     Given the following input,

          d.ask element=cell,raster  prompt="raster map layer to
          be used"

     d.ask will prompt the user to select a raster (cell) file
     from among those listed in the "cell" directories of the
     mapsets listed in his current mapset search path.  A pop-up
     menu will be displayed on the user's graphics monitor,
     containing the prompt:

          Double click on the  raster map layer to be used
          Double click here to cancel

OUTPUT
     If the user selects a file name from the displayed menu,
     d.ask writes three lines to standard output:

          name=file_name
          mapset=mapset_name
          fullname=file_name@mapset_name

     The output is in the form of /bin/sh commands to set the
     variable name to the file name specified by the user (of the
     element type requested by d.ask), mapset to the GRASS mapset
     in which this file resides, and fullname to the name of the
     file and its mapset.

     If the user elects not to select a file but instead chooses
     the "Double click here to cancel" option, the mouse will be
     deactivated and no variable assignments will be returned to
     standard output.

d.ask                GRASS Reference Manual                 d.ask



     If no files of the specified element type are found in the
     user's current mapset search path, the mouse is activated
     and the following message is displayed on the user's
     graphics monitor:

          No element description files found
          Click here to continue

NOTES
     Parameter values (the element name and description, and
     prompt message) cannot be supplied to d.ask interactively;
     they must be supplied on the command line or from a file.

BUGS
     This program calls other GRASS programs which may generate
     confusing error messages.  Example: an error message from
     the program d.menu will appear if a nonexistent map element
     is chosen.
