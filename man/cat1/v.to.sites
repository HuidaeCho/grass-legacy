NAME
     v.to.sites	- Converts point data in a binary GRASS	vector
     map layer into a GRASS site_lists file.
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.to.sites
     v.to.sites	help
     v.to.sites	input=name output=name [dmax=value -a -c -i ]

DESCRIPTION
     The v.to.sites program extracts data from a GRASS vector map
     layer and stores output in	a new GRASS site_lists file.  If
     -a	flag is	selected, v.to.sites extracts all vertices from	a
     vector file, if not selected, it extracts site (point)
     features only, ignoring lines and areas. If   -i flag is
     selected then, for	each line, if the distance between any
     two vertices on this line is greater that	dmax, additional
     points are	added to keep the distance withing  dmax range.
     The resulting sites map layer can be used with such programs
     as	d.sites.  The user can run the program non-interactively
     by	specifying the names of	an existing vector input map
     layer and a new site list file to be output on the	command
     line.  The	program	will be	run interactively if the user
     types v.to.sites without arguments	on the command line.  In
     this case,	the user will be prompted to enter parameter
     values through the	standard user interface	described in the
     manual entry for parser.


     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of an existing binary vector map
		       layer from which	site data are to be
		       extracted.

     output=name       Name to be assigned to the resultant
		       site_lists file.

     dmax=value	       Maximum distance	between	points (valid
		       only when -a and	-i are used)

     Flags:

     -a		       Outputs all vertices (instead of	site data
		       only) from vector file to site file

     -c		       The Category data is used instead of
		       attribute as a site description (valid
		       only when -a is used)

     -i		       Additional sites	are added between each 2

		       points on a line	if the distance	between
		       them is greater than specified  dmax.
		       (valid only when	-a is used)

     If	any of the sites have been labeled in v.digit, then the
     resultant site list will contain category information (or
     attribute in case -a was used but -c was not).  If	none of
     the sites are labeled, a binary (0/1) site	list file will be
     produced.
