NAME
     r.in.gif  - Converts a GIF87 (8bit) raster file to a GRASS
     raster file.
     (GRASS Raster Data Import Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.in.gif [-v] input=name]

DESCRIPTION
     This program converts a GIF raster file (8bit) to a GRASS
     raster file.  Output is placed in the /cell directory under
     the user's current GRASS mapset.

OPTIONS
Flag:
     Verbose mode

Parameters:
     Name of an existing GIF raster file to be imported.  Name to
     be assigned to resultant binary raster map layer.	Title to
     be assigned to resultant raster map layer.

     The program prompts the user to enter the name of the GIF
     raster file to be converted and the name to be assigned to
     the GRASS raster file to contain the resultant image.  The
     user should adjust boundary coordinates stored in the cell
     header after import using	r.support

     The user must, of course, first create the GIF raster file
     to be converted (e.g., from a scanning system that produces
     GIF raster file format).

NOTE
     The GIF89 format is currently not accepted.
