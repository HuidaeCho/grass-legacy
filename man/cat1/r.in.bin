NAME
     r.in.bin  - Import a binary raster file into a GRASS raster
     map layer.
     (GRASS Raster Data Import Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.in.bin
     r.in.bin help
     r.in.bin [-s] input=name output=name [title="phrase"]
     [mult=value] [bytes=value] north=value south=value
     east=value west=value r=value c=value [subst=old,new]

DESCRIPTION
     r.in.bin allows a user to create a (binary) GRASS raster map
     layer from a binary raster input file with (optional) title.

OPTIONS
Flags:
     Signed data (high bit means negative value)

Parameters:
     Name of an existing ASCII raster file to be imported.  Name
     to be assigned to resultant binary raster map layer.  Title
     to be assigned to resultant raster map layer.  Multiply all
     raster cell values by value.  value is a floating point
     value, and has a default value of 1.0.  Number of bytes per
     cell (1, 2, 4), default: 1 Northern limit of geographic
     region Southern limit of geographic region Eastern limit of
     geographic region Western limit of geographic region Number
     of rows Number of columns Replace 1st value by 2nd one,
     default: 0,0 The north, south, east, and west field values
     entered are the coordinates of the edges of the geographic
     region.  The rows and cols field values entered describe the
     dimensions of the matrix of data to follow.  The data which
     follows is r integers.

EXAMPLE
     The following is a sample call of r.in.bin to import GTOPO30
     DEM data:

     r.in.bin -s input=E020N90.DEM output=gtopo30 bytes=2
     north=90 south=40 east=60 west=20 r=6000 c=4800

     (you can add "subst=-9999,0" if you want sea level to have 0
     value)

NOTES
     The geographic coordinates north, south, east, and west
     describe the outer edges of the geographic region.	 They run
     along the edges of the cells at the edge of the geographic
     region and not through the center of the cells at the edges.
