p.colors <main>	      GRASS Reference Manual	  <main> p.colors



NAME
     p.colors - Allows the user to develop a color table that
     associates map categories with user-specified printer
     colors.
     (GRASS Hardcopy Output Program)

SYNOPSIS
     p.colors

DESCRIPTION
     This function allows the user to modify a color table for a
     raster map layer, by assigning colors to the categories in
     the raster map layer based on printer color numbers (instead
     of red, green, blue percentages).

     The user will need to have the printer color chart available
     to properly select the colors (see manual entry for
     p.chart).

     The p.colors function allows the user to exercise perfect
     control over the colors which appear in the hardcopy image.

NOTES
     If the user assigns a printer color number outside of the
     printer's range, p.colors will not complain, but will not
     save the out-of-range printer color number to the raster map
     layer's color table.

     This command modifies the color table associated with a map
     layer, and will therefore also affect the colors in which a
     map layer is displayed on the user's graphics monitor.  (See
     map color table files stored under $LOCATION/colr and
     $LOCATION/colr2.)
