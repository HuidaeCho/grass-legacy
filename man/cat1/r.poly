NAME
     r.poly - Extracts area edges from a raster map layer and
     converts data to GRASS vector format.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.poly
     r.poly help
     r.poly [-l] input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     r.poly scans the named input raster map layer, extracts area
     edge features from it, converts data to GRASS vector format,
     and smoothes vectors.

     r.poly first traces the perimeter of each unique area in the
     raster map layer and creates vector data to represent it.
     The cell category values for the raster map layer will be
     used to create attribute information for the resultant
     vector area edge data.

     A true vector tracing of the area edges might appear blocky,
     since the vectors outline the edges of raster data that are
     stored in rectangular cells.  To produce a better-looking
     vector map, r.poly smoothes the corners of the vector data
     as they are being extracted.  At each change in direction
     (i.e., each corner), the two midpoints of the corner cell
     (half the cell's height and width) are taken, and the line
     segment connecting them is used to outline this corner in
     the resultant vector file.	 (The cell's cornermost node is
     ignored.)	Because vectors are smoothed by this program, the
     resulting vector map will not be "true" to the raster map
     from which it was created.	 The user should check the
     resolution of the geographic region (and the original data)
     to estimate the possible error introduced by smoothing.

OPTIONS
     The user can run this program either non-interactively or
     interactively.  The program will be run non-interactively if
     the user specifies program arguments and flag settings on
     the command line using the form:

	  r.poly [-l] input=name output=name

     Alternately, the user can simply type r.poly on the command
     line without program arguments.  In this case, the user will
     be prompted for parameter values and flag settings using the
     standard GRASS parser interface described in the manual
     entry for parser.

     -l		       Smooth corners.


     Parameters:

     input=name	       Use the existing raster map name as input.

     output=name       Set the new vector output file name to
		       name.

NOTES
     r.poly extracts only area edges from the named raster input
     file.  If the raster file contains other data (i.e., line
     edges, or point data) the output may be wrong.

     The user must run v.support on the resultant file to build
     the needed topology information stored in the dig_plus file.
