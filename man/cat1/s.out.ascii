NAME
     s.out.ascii - Converts a GRASS site list file into an ASCII
     listing of site locations and their descriptions.
     (GRASS Sites Program)

SYNOPSIS
     s.out.ascii
     s.out.ascii help
     s.out.ascii [-ad] sites=name [fs=character|space|tab]

DESCRIPTION
     s.out.ascii converts an existing site list file (sites=name)
     into an ASCII listing of site locations and (optionally)
     their category labels, in a format suitable for input to
     other programs (e.g., d.points, m.u2ll, etc.).

     Each line of output consists of the easting, northing, and
     category label for a site listed in the named sites file.
     The fs=name option (where name is either a character, a
     space, or a tab) can be used to place a particular field
     separator between these three output fields.  This is useful
     when output is to be manipulated by other programs, like awk
     or sed.

     The GRASS program s.in.ascii can be used to perform the
     reverse function, converting a UNIX file containing
     eastings, northings, and category labels associated with
     site locations into GRASS site list file format.

     Flags:

     -a		       Output all sites found in the named sites
		       file, rather than limiting output to sites
		       falling within the current geographic
		       region.

     -d		       Include site descriptions (category
		       labels) in the output.

		       Parameters:

     sites=name	       Name of an existing site list file.

     fs=character|space|tab
		       The field separator to be placed between
		       the easting, northing, and (optionally)
		       category label on each line of output.
		       The field separator can be a character, a
		       space, or a tab.
		       Default:	 space

     s.out.ascii can be run either non-interactively or
     interactively.  The program will be run non-interactively if
     the user specifies the name of an existing site list file
     and (optionally) a value for fs, using the form

	  s.out.ascii [-ad] sites=name [fs=character|space|tab]

     where name is the name of an existing site list file to be
     converted to a brief ASCII listing, and fs is the field
     separator to be placed between output fields.  The user can
     also the -a and -d options to use all sites in the named
     sites file and to include site descriptions in the output.

     Alternately, the user can simply type s.out.ascii on the
     command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for parameter values using the
     standard GRASS parser interface described in the manual
     entry for parser.

NOTES
     The output from s.out.ascii may be placed into a file by
     using the UNIX redirection mechanism;  e.g.:

	  s.out.ascii sites=archsites > out.file

     s.out.ascii output may also be redirected into other
     programs;	e.g.:

	  s.out.ascii sites=archsites | d.points color=red
	  size=10 type=diamond
