DESCRIPTION
     r.weight is a language driven raster map overlay program.
     It provides a means for performing geographical analyses
     using several raster maps.  r.weight asks the user to weight
     (assign numeric values to) the raster map categories of
     interest.  The assignment of weighted values requires that
     the user intimately understand the analysis being
     undertaken.  How important is the slope of the land in
     comparison with the current land use, or the depth to
     bedrock?  The assignment of values to the land's
     characteristics allows r.weight to mix and compare apples
     and oranges, such as slopes and land uses, and soil types
     and vegetation.

     r.weight is a language-driven analysis tool.  It responds to
     worded commands typed at the terminal.  Help is always
     available via the one word command: help.  Commands
     available in r.weight are listed below.

SUGGESTED APPROACH
     In order for r.weight to generate raster maps useful for
     analysis, the user must make a reasonable and defensible
     request.  While much more powerful than r.combine, r.weight
     is also more dangerous.  The user provides the necessary
     value judgements which are registered as weights.  Only
     well-conceived value judgements will result in defensible
     results.  We suggest the following approach to a weighted
     overlay analysis:

     STEP 1: BEFORE RUNNING WEIGHT
             a) Define the question to be answered.  e.g., "Locate
                sites suitable for building apartments."
             b) Determine what mapped information is useful for
                answering the question.  e.g., geology, soils,
                land_use, flood_potential.
             c) Based on professional judgement, statistical
                inference, and engineering principals, assign
                weights to the categories in the chosen raster maps.
     STEP 2: CHOOSE CELL MAPS
             In r.weight, use the command choose to identify
             up to six raster maps of interest.
     STEP 3: ASSIGN WEIGHTS
             Using the r.weight command assign, assign
             specific weights to raster map categories.
     STEP 4: SAVE ANALYSIS
             Use the save command to save a copy of the analysis
             requested for later use.
     STEP 5: RUN ANALYSIS
             Use execute to run the analysis.
     STEP 6: EVALUATE RESULTS
             To modify an existing analysis request, use the recover
             command to retrieve the analysis and then go to STEP 3.
