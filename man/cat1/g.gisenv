NAME
     g.gisenv - Outputs the user's current GRASS variable
     settings.
     (GRASS File Management Program)

SYNOPSIS
     g.gisenv
     g.gisenv [variable_name]

DESCRIPTION
     When a user runs GRASS, certain variables are set specifying
     the GRASS data base, location, mapset, peripheral device
     drivers, etc., being used in the current GRASS session.
     These variable name settings are recognized as long as the
     user is running a GRASS session.

     No prompts are given to the user when running g.gisenv.  If
     run without arguments, g.gisenv lists all of the user's
     current GRASS variable settings.  Results are sent to
     standard output, and may look like this:

          GISDBASE=/usr/grass4/data
          LOCATION_NAME=spearfish
          MAPSET=PERMANENT

     In this example, the full path name of the user's current
     location (i.e., $LOCATION_NAME) is
     /usr/grass4/data/spearfish, and the full path name of the
     user's current mapset (i.e., $MAPSET) is
     /usr/grass4/data/spearfish/PERMANENT.

     If the user specifies a variable_name on the command line
     (e.g., g.gisenv MAPSET), only the value for that particular
     GRASS variable is output to standard output.  Possible
     variable names depend on the user's system.

     While other variables may be associated with each GRASS
     session (e.g., DIGITIZER, PAINTER, DISPLAY, and other
     variables), those stated below are essential.

     GISDBASE - The $GISDBASE is a directory in which all users'
          GRASS data are stored.  Within the $GISDBASE, data are
          segregated into subdirectories (called "locations")
          based on the map coordinate system used and the
          geographic extent of the data.  Each "location"
          directory itself contains subdirectories called
          "mapsets"; each "mapset" stores "data base elements" --
          the directories (e.g., the cell, cellhd, dig, etc.,
          directories) in which GRASS data files are actually
          stored.

     LOCATION_NAME - The user must choose to work with the data

          under a single GRASS location within any given GRASS
          session; this location is then called the current GRASS
          location, and is specified by the variable
          $LOCATION_NAME.  The $LOCATION_NAME is the GRASS data
          base location whose data will be affected by any GRASS
          commands issued during the user's current GRASS
          session, and is a subdirectory of the current
          $GISDBASE.  Each "location" directory can contain
          multiple "mapset" directories (including the special
          mapset "PERMANENT").  Maps stored under the same GRASS
          LOCATION_NAME (and/or within the same MAPSET) must use
          the same coordinate system and typically fall within
          the boundaries of the same geographic region (aka,
          "location").

     MAPSET - Each "mapset" contains a set of maps relevant to
          the LOCATION_NAME directory in which it appears.  Each
          LOCATION_NAME can contain multiple mapsets.  (Mapsets
          which fall under the same LOCATION_NAME all contain
          data geographically relevant to the LOCATION_NAME, and
          all store data in the same map coordinate system.
          Frequently, maps are placed into different mapsets to
          distinguish file ownership -- e.g., each user might
          have his own mapset, storing any maps that he has
          created and/or are relevant to his work.) During each
          GRASS session, the user must choose one mapset to be
          the current mapset;  the current mapset setting is
          given by $MAPSET, and is a subdirectory of
          $LOCATION_NAME.  During a single GRASS session, the
          user can use available data in any of the mapsets
          stored under the current LOCATION_NAME directory that
          are in the user's mapset search path and accessible by
          the user.  However, within a single GRASS session, the
          user only has write access to data stored under the
          current mapset (specified by the variable $MAPSET).

          Each "mapset" stores GRASS data base elements (i.e.,
          the directories in which GRASS data files are stored).
          Any maps created or modified by the user in the current
          GRASS session will be stored here.  The MAPSET
          directory "PERMANENT" is generally reserved for the set
          of maps that form the base set for all users working
          under each LOCATION_NAME.

     Once within a GRASS session, GRASS users have access only to
     the data under a single GRASS data base directory (the
     current GRASS data base, specified by the variable
     $GISDBASE), and to a single GRASS location directory (the
     current location, specified by the variable $LOCATION_NAME).
     Within a single session, the user may only modify the data
     in the current mapset (specified by the variable $MAPSET),
     but may use data available under other mapsets under the

     same LOCATION_NAME.

     All of these names must be legal names on the user's current
     system.  For UNIX users, names less than 14 characters and
     containing no non-printing or space codes are permissible.
     Examples of permissible names include: one, mymap, VeGe_map,
     and 1_for_me.  The underscore character can safely be used
     in place of a blank for multiple-word names.

NOTES
     The output from g.gisenv when invoked without arguments is
     directly usable by /bin/sh.  The following command will cast
     each variable into the UNIX environment:

          eval `g.gisenv`

     This works only for /bin/sh. The format of the output is not
     compatible with other UNIX shells.
