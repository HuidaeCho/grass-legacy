NAME
     d.rast.edit - Program allowing users to interactively edit
     the cell category values of raster	map layers displayed on
     the graphics monitor.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.rast.edit
     d.rast.edit help
     d.rast.edit

DESCRIPTION
     The d.rast.edit program allows users to interactively edit
     cell category values in a raster map layer	displayed to the
     graphics monitor using a mouse cursor.  This program
     determines	the name of the	raster map layer currently
     displayed in the active frame on the selected graphics
     monitor (if none, program will abort).  The user is then
     prompted for the name of a	new raster layer to be created in
     his mapset.  d.rast.edit does not modify the user's original
     raster map	layer.

Geographic Region Concerns
     d.rast.edit reads the region definition for the raster map
     layer being edited	from its cell header file.  The	new,
     edited copy of the	raster layer will be created with the
     same resolution and region	dimensions.  If	the current
     region resolution does not	match the raster map layer's
     resolution, the program will abort.  The north, south, east,
     and west geographic region	settings of the	current	region
     can be set	to any view, as	long as	they fall within the
     boundaries	of the raster map layer	described in its cell
     header.  This is important, since the current view	must be
     such that individual cell locations are easily visible and
     sufficiently large	on the graphics	monitor	to be pointed at
     with the mouse cursor.  Any mask in place will be ignored
     when writing the new raster map layer.

Mouse Menus
     Cell editing is done using	a mouse	cursor to choose menu
     selections	and indicate areas on the displayed raster map
     that are to be edited.

     Selections	available via the Main Menu and	the subsequent
     functions or sub-menus are	described below:

	  1. Edit
	       invokes edit mode, during which no graphic menus
	       are used, so that none of the displayed map is
	       hidden. At the start of the edit	mode, a	grid is
	       drawn over displayed cells to help distinguish
	       cell boundaries.	Interaction with the program

	       during edit mode	is done	by using the three mouse
	       buttons as follows:

	       Left Button
		    what's here.  Identify the category	value of
		    the	cell under the mouse cursor when the
		    button is pressed.	The category value of
		    this cell is printed in the	text frame.

	       Middle Button
		    edit.  The current category	value of the cell
		    under the mouse cursor is iterated and a
		    prompt for a new cell value	appears	on the
		    textual command frame.  (Remember to move the
		    mouse to the text frame).  Enter a new cell
		    category value which is within the range of
		    current category values for	the map	layer.
		    Note:  the edited cell is displayed	in the
		    color of the newly-assigned	category value,
		    but	is hatched with	lines of the grid color
		    to indicate	it has been edited, since, if the
		    value of the cell is polled	(before	leaving
		    edit mode),	the old	category value will be
		    reported.

	       Right Button
		    exit edit mode.  Command is	returned to the
		    Main Menu on the graphics monitor.	If cell
		    value changes were made during edit	mode,
		    they will be saved upon exit.

	  2. Redraw
	       redisplays the raster map layer on the graphics
	       monitor.

	  3. Zoom
	       calls the d.rast.zoom program, to allow changing
	       the view	of the raster layer.  Zoom's instructions
	       will appear on the text command window.
	       Interaction is conducted	using mouse keys.

	  4. Arrow
	       This function is	available for users editing
	       aspect maps.  The d.rast.arrow program is called,
	       which draws arrows over the displayed cells to
	       indicate	the downslope direction	of the cell.
	       After selecting the arrow selection from	the main
	       menu, sub-menus will appear, allowing input
	       options to be set for the d.rast.arrow program.
	       The first sub-menu selects the type of aspect data
	       displayed.  (regular "GRASS" format, as produced
	       by r.slope.aspect; a format prepared as input to

	       the "AGNPS" program; and	a format prepared for the
	       "ANSWERS" program. The d.rast.arrow program can
	       accept the name of a layer not drawn on the
	       display for use as input, and an	option is given
	       to input	the name of that layer,	if desired.
	       Otherwise, the currently	displayed map layer will
	       be used.	 Next, the color options of d.rast.arrow
	       may be set via separate menus, or a choice for
	       using default settings may be used.

	  5. Number
	       calls the d.rast.num program, which will	print the
	       cell category values over the displayed cells on
	       the graphic monitor.

	  6. Exit
	       quit the	d.rast.edit program.  If edits have been
	       made, the new raster map	layer will be created.
	       Support files are constructed.  Category	labels
	       and color maps (if any) are copied from the
	       original	layer.	d.rast.edit redisplays the
	       original	raster map file	on the monitor as it
	       exits.

NOTES
     d.rast.edit will not create a new raster map layer	if the
     user makes	no cell	edits while running the	program.

     Be	careful	not to cover the graphics monitor window with
     another frame during the editing process.	In some	cases,
     the redraw	option will be able to remove traces of	other
     frames;  otherwise, the graphics monitor will not be
     refreshed until after d.rast.edit exits.  Further note,
     however, that this	has only been tested on	SUN workstations,
     using a modified SUNVIEW graphics monitor driver.

     The primary bane of the d.rast.edit program involves large
     map layers	(with lots of rows and columns)	and/or slow
     computers,	since the program must read and	write raster map
     layers row	by row for the full size of the	map layer as
     dictated by its region size and resolution.  (The current
     region settings of	north, south, east, and	west will not
     limit the size of the edited copy of the map layer, since by
     use of the	d.rast.zoom program, these values may change
     several times during the editing session).	Their effects
     could be lessened if the program were to create a table of
     changes that it could incorporate into the	new raster file
     on	a forked process started when the user exits, or
     otherwise allow the user to issue a "save"	command	when he
     has made all desired edits	to the raster file.  Currently,
     for instance, if the user needs to	use d.rast.zoom	to access
     a different area of the map, he must wait for a read and

     write for each entrance and egress	of the edit mode.

     There is no "undo"	command	or way to exit edit mode without
     saving changes.

     It	would be nice to incorporate a scrollable version of
     d.legend (such that one could see a legend	for files with
     many categories on	a standard size	sub-frame).  It	would be
     even nicer	to be able to select the category values from a
     graphical legend when editing cell	values (thereby	saving a
     trip to the text frame to type in the new value).

     Perhaps method(s) for multiple  or	mass cell edits	would be
     useful.  This could be done by providing modes in which the
     user may:	1) edit	a block	of cells to a given value by
     drawing a box; 2) be able to choose a given value which is
     automatically used	as the new value on each cell chosen
     until a different value is	desired.

     There is no interrupt handling.  This could leave files in
     .tmp or (rarely) result in	half-baked raster files.  The
     original file would survive unscathed by an interrupt at
     most any point in execution, but the graphics monitor may be
     left in an	indeterminate state (try d.erase or d.mon
     select=monitor_name to bring it back into shape).	Beware of
     exiting the program by means other	than using exit	on the
     Main Menu.


     The program has no	method to enter	new values beyond the
     current range of categories, but additional programming
     could make	it so.
