d.profile <main>      GRASS Reference Manual	 <main> d.profile



NAME
     d.profile - Displays profiles of a user-specified raster map
     layer.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.profile

DESCRIPTION
     This command works only interactively.  It clears the entire
     graphics screen and provides a graphical interaction
     allowing the selection of transects for which profiles are
     then generated.

USER PROMPTS
     First, you will be presented with a prompt asking you to
     choose a raster map layer to be profiled.	Once you specify
     a valid raster map layer name, the map layer will be
     displayed in the left half of the graphics display, and the
     right half of the dispay will be divided into four display
     frames.  There will also be two frames along the top of the
     display:  a mouse-button menu frame on the left, and a
     status frame on the right.

     The mouse-button menu initially offers you three options:

	  Mouse Buttons:
	     Left:	  Where am I?
	     Middle:	  Mark FIRST Point of Profile Line.
	     Right:	  QUIT this.

     You may query the displayed raster map layer by indicating
     points with the left mouse-button.	 The coordinates and
     category value of each point that you indicate will be
     displayed on in the status frame.	If you mark the first
     point of the profile line you will be presented with the
     following mouse-button menu:

	  Mouse Buttons:
	     Left:	  Where am I?
	     Middle:	  Mark SECOND Point of Profile Line.
	     Right:	  QUIT this.

     Once you mark the second point of the profile line, the
     profile line will be labeled (with a letter from A to D) and
     displayed in one of the four display frames on the right
     hand side of the screen.  You will then be presented with a
     third mouse-button menu:

	  Mouse Buttons:
	     Left:	  DO ANOTHER
	     Middle:	  CLEAR DISPLAY

	     Right:	  QUIT this.

     If you would like to view another profile, click on the left
     mouse-button.  If you would like to redisplay the raster map
     layer and clear out the four profile frames, click on the
     middle mouse-button.  If you would like to quit, then click
     on the right button.

NOTES
     Useful enhancements to d.profile would include:

     1) Adding an option to display profiles using category
     colors, like a bar-chart.
     2) Allowing profile lines to be defined by a series of
     points, not just two.
     3) Allowing profiles to be saved in a file, for later
     viewing.
     4) Allowing the user to enter profile line points by typing
     coordinates.
