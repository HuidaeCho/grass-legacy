NAME
     r.surf.xy - GRASS module to produce two raster maps for use
     with r.mapcalc. One file contains the x-coordinates of each
     raster map cell, the other, the y-coordinates.

SYNOPSIS
     r.surf.xy x=name

Parameters:
     Name of the new raster map layer to hold x coordinate
     values.  Name of the new raster map layer to hold y
     coordinate values.	 These two cell files can be used to
     produce mathematical functions in the form: z = fn(x,y) This
     is required as r.mapcalc does not provide variables which
     hold the current x and y coordinates of the moving window.
     Use these maps in calculations which are coordinate
     dependent.

NOTE
     x and y values are in RELATIVE coordinates to an origin of
     (0,0) at the bottom left corner. To transfrom back to
     georeferenced coordinates use r.mapcalc to add the relative
     offset to the origin.
