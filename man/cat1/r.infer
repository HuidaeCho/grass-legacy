NAME
     r.infer - Outputs a raster map layer whose category values
     represent the application of user-specified criteria (rules
     statements) to other raster map layers' category values.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.infer
     r.infer help
     r.infer [-vt] rulesfile=name

DESCRIPTION
     r.infer is an inference engine which applies a set of user-
     specified rules to named raster map layers.  A new raster
     map layer named infer is created as output, whose category
     values reflect the ability of each cell in the named input
     layers to satisfy the named conditions.

     r.infer commands (conditions and consequences) are typed
     into a file by the user using a system editor like vi, and
     then input to r.infer as the rulesfile named on the command
     line.  The results are used to generate a new raster map
     layer named infer in the user's current mapset.  This
     program performs analyses similar to r.combine, but uses a
     (possibly) more pleasing syntax and approach.

OPTIONS
     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies the name of a rules file and any desired flags on
     the command line, using the form:

          r.infer [-vt] rulesfile=name

     where name is the name of an ASCII file containing valid
     input rules to r.infer, and the (optional) flags -v and -t
     have the meanings described in the OPTIONS section, below.

     Alternately, the user can simply type r.infer on the command
     line, without program arguments.  In this case, the user
     will be prompted for the needed parameter value and flag
     settings using the standard GRASS parser interface described
     in the manual entry for parser.

     Flags:

     -t   Allows the user to run r.infer in test mode.  The user
          is questioned about the truth of each condition named
          in the file.  r.infer then outputs the value that would
          be placed in the new layer infer for a cell meeting
          conditions specified by the user.  When no sets of
          conditions stated in the input file are satisfied
          (based upon the user's answers), cell values of zero

          are output.  Test mode is used to test the accuracy of
          the user's logic.  Users are encouraged to run r.infer
          in test mode prior to actually creating map layers.

     -v   Makes r.infer run verbosely, giving information about
          each cell as it is analyzed according to the statement
          conditions.

     Parameter:

     rulesfile=name
          Allows the user to input rules to r.infer from an ASCII
          file, rather than from standard input.  This rulesfile
          must exist in the user's current working directory or
          be given by its full pathname.  File rules statements
          take the same form as those given on the command line.
          Examples of valid rules statements are given in the
          sections below.





COMMANDS AND STATEMENTS
     The following commands are available in r.infer:

      Command  |   Aliases |      Followed By    |        Such As
     __________|___________|_____________________|______________________
     IFMAP     |  ANDIFMAP |  cellmap cat#       |  geology 2
               |  ANDMAP   |                     |
     __________|___________|_____________________|______________________
     IFNOTMAP  |  ANDNOTMAP|  cellmap cat#       |  geology 2
     __________|___________|_____________________|______________________
     THENMAPHYP|           |  cat# [statement]   |  3 nice vacation spot
     __________|___________|_____________________|______________________
     THEN      |           |  statement          |  No sandstone
               |           |  condition          |
     __________|___________|_____________________|______________________
     IF        |  AND      |  predefined         |  No sandstone
               |  ANDIF    |  statement condition|

     These five commands may be used to formulate statements with
     functions ranging from a simple reclassification to a more
     complex expert system type application.  Statements are
     composed of one or more conditions followed by one or more
     hypotheses and/or conclusions.  The use of aliases is
     provided to allow for the use of a command which has an
     English meaning consistent with the logic at that point.

     Following is a description of each of the five commands.
     The map layers used in the examples are in the Spearfish
     sample data base.

  IFMAP
  Map condition.
  Map conditions are questions to each cell about the presence of
     specified map layer category values.  r.infer questions each
     cell in the named map layer (here, geology) about its
     contents (i.e., category value).  Cells which satisfy the
     named condition(s) stated by IFMAP (i.e., here, those cells
     which contain geology map layer category values 4 or 5) will
     be assigned the subsequently-stated map conclusion or
     hypothesis (category), in the new map layer infer.  Cells
     which fail to satisfy named map condition(s) will continue
     to move down through the user's rulesfile (searching for
     conditions it is able to satisfy) if any additional
     conclusions/hypotheses are stated in the file, or will be
     assigned category zero in the new map layer infer (if no
     additional conclusions/hypotheses are possible in this
     rulesfile).

     example:  IFMAP geology 4 5


  IFNOTMAP
  Map condition.
  Like IFMAP, but instead questions each cell about the absence
     of specified map layer categories.  Cells which meet the
     IFNOTMAP conditions (i.e., below, those cells which do NOT
     include owner map layer category value 2) will be assigned
     the named conclusionothesis, in the new map layer infer.

     example: IFNOTMAP owner 2


  THENMAPHYP
  Map conclusion.
  Assigns each cell a specified category value in the new map
     layer infer based on the cell's ability or failure to meet
     conditions named above this THENMAPHYP statement in the
     rulesfile.  The user should note that although the user can
     specify a uniquely-named rulesfile, r.infer always directs
     its output to a file named infer in the current mapset
     (overwriting whatever is currently in this file).
     Therefore, if the user wishes to save this file for future
     use, this file should be renamed before the user next runs
     r.infer (e.g., using the GRASS command g.rename).

     It is important to realize that r.infer runs through the
     conditions stated in the named rulesfile one cell at a time,
     moving from the top of the raster input file to the bottom
     of the raster input file.  As soon as the cell currently
     being examined by r.infer satisfies a set of conditions, it
     is assigned a category value in the new map layer infer.
     r.infer does NOT check to see if that same cell satisfies

     other conditions named further down in the input file, too.
     Instead, it moves on to the next cell, and begins anew with
     the conditions named at the top of the input file.
     Essentially, this means that conclusions made higher-up in
     the input file have precedence over conditions named further
     down in the input file.


     example:   IFMAP density 1
               THENMAPHYP 1 no trees

     In the above example, all cells having a category value of 1
     (non-forest) in the map layer density, are assigned a
     category value of 1 in the resultant map layer infer.  The
     trailing text "no trees" is entered into the category
     support file for category 1 in the new map layer infer.

  THEN
  Statement hypothesis.
  At the conclusion of one or several condition statements,
     instead of making a map conclusion as with THENMAPHYP, the
     conditions are used to create a hypothesis.  This may then
     be referenced in later statements using the IF command.  The
     trailing text at the end of the THEN statement is used as
     the means with which to reference the hypothesis.  An
     example follows the description of IF below.

  IF
  Statement condition.
  States a condition based on an hypothesis that was created by a
     previous THEN statement.  IF may be used only after a THEN
     has set up the group of statements that are to be referenced
     later.


     example:  IFMAP elevation.255 170-255
               ANDIFMAP density 3 4
               THEN high elevation with trees
               !
               IF high elevation with trees
               ANDIFMAP owner 2
               THENMAPHYP 1 this is the place

     The above example queries each cell for the presence of both
     elevations greater than 1580 meters (i.e., for elevation.255
     category values 170-255) and a medium to high density of
     trees (i.e., density category values 3 4).  All areas (i.e.,
     cells) that satisfy these criteria are assigned to the
     hypothesis "high elevation with trees." The "!" simply tells
     r.infer to ignore whatever appears on that line (a comment
     statement), and is used here for readability.

     The IF statement then references cells having "high
     elevation with trees" (i.e., those cells that satisfied both
     of the above conditions named by the IFMAP and ANDIFMAP
     statements).  If a cell both has "high elevations with
     trees" and owner map layer category 2 (areas owned by the
     Forest Service), it is assigned by the THENMAPHYP statement
     to category 1 in the new map layer infer.  The trailing text
     "this is the place" is automatically entered into the
     category support file for the new map infer.  Cells failing
     to meet all of the conditions stated in this input file will
     be assigned category 0 in the new map layer infer.
