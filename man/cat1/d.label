d.label <main>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <main> d.label



NAME
     d.label - Creates and displays text labels in the active
     display frame on the graphics monitor.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.label
     d.label help
     d.label [size=value] [backcolor=name]
     [textcolor=name] [font=name]

DESCRIPTION
     d.label allows the user to create and display text labels in
     the active frame on the graphics monitor.	It interactively
     requests that the user type in text and use the pointing
     device (mouse) to identify where this text is to be placed
     within the active graphics frame.	The program will prompt
     the user for label size, background color, text color, and
     text font type, if the user fails to specify these values on
     the command line.	Program prompts use the standard GRASS
     parser interface described in the manual entry for parser.


     Parameters:

     size=value	       Sets the label text size to the specified
		       number.	Values are stated as a percentage
		       of the frame height;  e.g., a size of 10
		       will make each line of text equal to one-
		       tenth the height of the display frame.
		       Options:	 0-1000
		       Default:	 10

     backcolor=name    Sets the color of the label background to
		       the name stated.
		       Options:	 red, orange, yellow, green,
		       blue, indigo, violet, gray, white, and
		       black.
		       Default:	 black

     textcolor=name    Sets the color of the label text to the
		       name stated.
		       Options:	 same as for backcolor.
		       Default:	 white

     font=name	       Sets the font type used for the label's
		       text to name.
		       Options:	 romand, romanp, romant, romans,
		       scriptc, scripts, romancs, italicc,
		       italiccs, gothitt, gothgrt, and gothgbt.
		       The user can view these available fonts by
		       running show.fonts.sh.

		       Default:	 romans	 (Roman simplex font
		       type), or whatever font the user has set
		       the font type to before entering d.label.

NOTES
     This program will allow the user to display labels anywhere
     in the active display frame, even in areas lying outside of
     the current geographic region.

     d.label will only allow the user to type in one line of
     text.  The fully interactive program d.labels can be used to
     create text labels having as many as four lines.

     d.label does not create paint labels files displayable by
     d.paint.labels -- d.labels does.  These programs should be
     integrated in future GRASS releases.

BUGS
     If the user is running GRASS under X Windows, and the user
     enters a text label longer than 80 characters (i.e., allows
     text to wrap onto a second line), X Windows will stop the
     user's GRASS graphics monitor without throwing the user out
     of GRASS.	If this happens, the user should simply restart a
     graphics monitor, using d.mon.
