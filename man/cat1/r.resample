NAME
     r.resample - GRASS raster map layer data resampling
     capability.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.resample
     r.resample help
     r.resample [-q] input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     r.resample resamples the data values in a user-specified
     raster input map layer name (bounded by the current
     geographic region and masked by the current mask), and
     produces a new raster output map layer name containing the
     results of the resampling.  The category values in the new
     raster output map layer will be the same as those in the
     original, except that the resolution and extent of the new
     raster output map layer will match those of the current
     geographic region settings (see g.region).

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies program arguments on the command line, using the
     form

          r.resample [-q] input=name output=name

     where the input name is the name of the raster map layer
     whose data are to be resampled, the output name is the name
     of the raster map layer to store program output, and the -q
     option, if present, directs that r.resample run quietly
     (supressing the printing of program messages to standard
     output).

     Alternately, the user can simply type r.resample on the
     command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for needed inputs and option choices
     using the standard GRASS parser interface described in the
     manual entry for parser.

NOTES
     The method by which resampling is conducted is "nearest
     neighbor" (see r.neighbors).  The resulting raster map layer
     will have the same resolution as the resolution of the
     current geographic region (set using g.region).

     The resulting raster map layer may be identical to the
     original raster map layer.  The r.resample program will copy
     the color table and history file associated with the
     original raster map layer for the resulting raster map layer
     and will create a modified category file which contains
     description of only those categories which appear in

     resampled file.

     When the user resamples a GRASS reclass file, a true raster
     file is created by r.resample.
