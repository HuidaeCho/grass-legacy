NAME
     i.tape.tm - An imagery function that extracts LANDSAT
     Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery from half-inch tape.
     (GRASS Image Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     i.tape.tm

DESCRIPTION
     i.tape.tm is a program that extracts LANDSAT Thematic Mapper
     (TM) imagery from half-inch tape.

     This program must be run in a LOCATION_NAME with a x,y
     coordinate system (i.e., a coordinate system with projection
     0).  For further information regarding this LOCATION_NAME
     refer to the imagery manual entry.

     The first prompt in i.tape.tm asks the user for the tape
     device name.  This is sometimes  /dev/rmt0 (for a half-inch
     tape having a density of 1600 bpi), but this varies with
     each machine.

     The next prompt is:

     Please mount and load tape, then hit RETURN -->


IMAGE IDENTIFICATION MENU
     The first menu in the program asks the user for information
     about the data.

	       please enter the following information

	 Tape Identification:				-----

	 Image Description:				-----

	 Title for the Extracted Raster (Cell) Files:	-----

	 AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
		       (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)


     This program automatically enters the scene ID number into
     the field for Tape Identification.	 The mission, path, row,
     quadrant, date, and whether the image is corrected is
     automatically entered into the field for Image Description.

     The second menu is:

		       THEMATIC MAPPER EXTRACT
     please select the desired tape window (geographic region
			definition) to extract

		      first row: _______(1-2984)
		      last row: _______(1-2984)

		      first col: _______(1-4220)
		      last col: _______(1-4220)


	 AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
		       (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

     The numbers in parentheses are the total number of rows and
     columns on the tape including zeros (filler).  This
     information and additional information can also be obtained
     by running the program m.examine.tape.  m.examine.tape will
     read any tape and provide the user with the number of files
     on a tape, the number of records on a tape, and the record
     lengthes.	Any subset of the image on the tape may be
     extracted.	 For a discussion of row and column extraction
     see the subheading entitled ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION below.

     The next menu is:

	   please make an x by the bands you want extracted

			       _____ 1
			       _____ 2
			       _____ 3
			       _____ 4
			       _____ 5
			       _____ 6
			       _____ 7

	 AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
		       (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

     TM imagery has 7 bands, but the user may want to extract
     only a subset of these bands.  See the subheading in this
     entry entitled ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION.

     The user then is asked to enter the prefix/group for the
     raster band files to be created.  This name will precede
     each band file extracted into GRASS.  For example, if three
     bands are extracted the following three band files will
     result:

			     prefixname.1
			     prefixname.2
			     prefixname.3

     The specified prefixname will also automatically become the
     name for the imagery group file being created.  Each image
     or quad (i.e., each run of i.tape.tm) should be given a
     unique prefix/group name.

     The extraction process will begin by first skipping the
     number of specified files, advancing to the first band
     requested, and then reading the tape.  After extracting the
     requested rows and columns for each band, the program
     creates support files for the raster band map layer.  The
     percent completion of the extraction is displayed on the
     screen.  Because TM imagery is divided into four quads and
     is stored in multiple tape sets, the program is designed to
     read one quad at a time.  The number of tapes required to
     store one quad depends on the number of bytes per inch in
     which the data is stored.	If more than one tape is required
     to store one quad, the program will pause and inform the
     user to mount the next tape.

     The extracted band files will be listed as raster map layers
     available in the current MAPSET and may be displayed using
     the GRASS commands d.display, d.rast or i.points.

NOTES
     After extracting an image from tape the geographic region
     definition in the x,y coordinate LOCATION_NAME will be set
     based upon the extracted rows and columns from the tape.
     The relationship between the image rows and columns and the
     coordinates of the geographic region is discussed in the
     imagery manual entry.

     This program is interactive and requires no command line
     arguments.

ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION
     The display options in GRASS allow the user to locate rows
     and columns on the digital image.	If enough disk space is
     available, one band of an entire image or, one band of a
     portion of an image known to contain the area of interest,
     can be extracted and displayed.  The measurements option in
     d.display, or d.where (following use of d.rast) will echo x
     and y coordinates to the screen.  (These coordinates will
     display negative numbers in the north-south direction, but
     ignoring the negative sign will yield the row number.)  See
     the imagery manual entry for further explanation.

     Each quad of a TM image contains filler on both the left and
     right sides of the quad.  The user may want to identify the
     row and column numbers in order to exclude the filler. This
     filler will otherwise be extracted with the image and take
     up unnecessary disk space.

     If a photograph of the digital image is available, the rows
     and columns to be extracted can be determined from it by
     associating inches with the total number of known rows and
     columns in the scene.  For example, if the total length of
     the photograph is 12 inches, the total number of rows on the
     tape is 2000, and the northwest corner of the area of
     interest begins 2 inches from the top of the photo, then:

		    12" / 2000 rows = 2" / x rows
			     x = 333.333

     The northwest corner of the area of interest starts at row
     333.  The starting row, ending row, starting column, and
     ending column can be calculated in this manner.
