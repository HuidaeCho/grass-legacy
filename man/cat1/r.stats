r.stats <main>       GRASS Reference Manual        <main> r.stats



NAME
     r.stats - Generates area statistics for raster map layers.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.stats
     r.stats help
     r.stats [-1aclmqzgx] input=name[,name,...]
     [fs=character|space] [output=name]

DESCRIPTION
     r.stats calculates the area present in each of the
     categories of user-selected raster map layer(s).  Area
     statistics are given in units of square meters and/or cell
     counts.  This analysis uses the current geographic region
     and mask settings.  Output can be sent to a file in the
     user's current working directory.

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies the program arguments and desired options on the
     command line, using the form

     r.stats [-1aclmqzgx] input=name[,name,...]
     [fs=character|space] [output=name]

     where each input name is the name of a raster map layer on
     which area/cell statistics are to be generated, the
     (optional) output name is the name of a file to contain
     program output (sent to the user's current working
     directory), the fs character or space is the field separator
     to be used to separate data fields in the output file
     (default is a space if unspecified), and the (optional)
     flags -1, -a, -c, -l, -m, -q, -z, -g, and -x have the
     meanings described in the OPTIONS section.

     Alternately, the user can simply type r.stats on the command
     line, without program arguments.  In this case, the user
     will be prompted for needed inputs and option choices using
     the standard GRASS parser interface described in the manual
     entry for parser.

OPTIONS
     Flags:

     -1                The data for each cell in the current
                       geographic region will be output, one cell
                       per line, rather than the totals for each
                       distinct combination.

     -a                Print area totals in square meters.

     -c                Print total cell counts.

     -m                Report all zero values present in the
                       input map layer(s), whether or not they
                       fall inside or outside the current mask
                       (see r.mask).  When a mask is present,
                       r.stats will only report zero values
                       falling within the mask area unless the
                       user runs r.stats with the -m option.
                       When the user runs r.stats with the -m
                       option, r.stats will report zero values
                       falling outside the mask area, in addition
                       to those within the mask.

     -l                Prints the category label(s) as well as
                       the category number(s).

     -q                Run quietly, and suppress printing of
                       percent complete messages to standard
                       output.

     -z                Report only non-zero data values.  Zero
                       data will not be reported.  However, for
                       multiple map layers this means that if
                       zero values occur in every map layer, they
                       will not be reported; if non-zero category
                       values occur in any map layer (along with
                       zeros in others), the non-zero values
                       along with the zero values will be
                       reported.

     -g                Print the grid coordinates (easting and
                       northing), for each cell.  This option
                       works only if the -1 option is also
                       specified.

     -x                Print the x and y (column and row) values,
                       for each cell.  This option works only if
                       the -1 option is also specified.


     Parameters:

     input=name        The name(s) of one or more existing raster
                       map layer(s) whose cell counts or area
                       statistics are to be calculated.

     fs=character  or  fs=space
                       The field separator (fs) to be used to
                       separate data fields in the output file.
                       Options:  a character or space
                       Default:  a space

     output=name       The name to be assigned to the ASCII

                       output file.

NON-INTERACTIVE PROGRAM USE
     If users invoke program options on the command line, r.stats
     will print out area statistics for the user-specified raster
     map layers in a columnar format suitable for input to UNIX
     programs like awk and sed.  Output can be saved by
     specifying the name of an output file on the command line.

     If a single map layer is specified on the command line, a
     list of areas in square meters (assuming the map's
     coordinate system is in meters) for each category in the
     raster map layer will be printed.  (If the -c option is
     chosen, areas will be stated in number of cells.) If
     multiple raster map layers are specified on the command
     line, a cross-tabulation table of areas for each combination
     of categories in the map layers will be printed.

     For example, if one raster map layer were specified, the
     output would look like:

          1:1350000.00
          2:4940000.00
          3:8870000.00

     If three raster map layers a, b, and c, were specified, the
     output would look like:

          0:0:0:8027500.00
          0:1:0:1152500.00
          1:0:0:164227500.00
          1:0:1:2177500.00
          1:1:0:140092500.00
          1:1:1:3355000.00
          2:0:0:31277500.00
          2:0:1:2490000.00
          2:1:0:24207500.00
          2:1:1:1752500.00
          3:0:0:17140000.00
          3:1:0:11270000.00
          3:1:1:2500.00

     Within each grouping, the first field represents the
     category value of map layer a, the second represents the
     category values associated with map layer b, the third
     represents category values for map layer c, and the last
     field gives the area in square meters for the particular
     combination of these three map layers' categories.  For
     example, above, combination 3,1,1 covered 2500 square
     meters.  Fields are separated by colons.

NOTES
     r.stats works in the current geographic region with the
     current mask.

     If a nicely formatted output is desired, pipe the output
     into a command which can create columnar output.  For
     example, the command:

         r.stats input=a,b,c | pr -3 | cat -s

     will create a three-column output

     1:4:4:10000.00          2:1:5:290000.00         2:4:5:2090000.00
     1:4:5:1340000.00        2:2:5:350000.00         3:1:2:450000.00
     2:1:1:1090000.00        2:4:1:700000.00         3:1:3:5280000.00
     2:1:3:410000.00         2:4:3:10000.00          3:1:5:3140000.00

     The output from r.stats on more than one map layer is
     sorted.

     Note that the user has only the option of printing out cell
     statistics in terms of cell counts and/or area totals.
     Users wishing to use different units than are available here
     should use the GRASS program r.report.
