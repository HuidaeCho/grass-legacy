NAME
     r.support - Allows the user to create and/or modify raster
     map layer support files.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.support

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS program r.support allows the user to create and/or
     modify raster map layer support files.  It may be run only
     on raster map layers in the user's current mapset.

     No non-interactive version of this program currently exists;
     the user runs the program by typing r.support, and will be
     queried for inputs.

     Various GRASS programs depend on one or more of the
     following GRASS support files:

     cellhd    The cell header file contains information on a
               map's projection, zone, regional boundaries, row
               and column totals, cell resolution, storage
               format, and compression.  It describes where and
               how this map's raster (cell) data fits in with
               reference to other raster map layers' data.
               Without it, the raster map layer could not be
               displayed or analyzed properly.  Using r.support,
               the user can change the # of columns, # of bytes
               per cell, and default geographic region settings.
               Generally, users would not change this
               information.  Cell header files are stored under
               the cellhd directory under the user's current
               mapset.

     stats     Raster map layer statistics are saved in the form
               of a histogram and range of the category values
               which occur in the map layer.  Statistics files
               are stored in subdirectories of the cell_misc
               directory under the user's current mapset.

     cats      A category file associates each category value in
               the raster map layer with a category description
               (label).  The user may add or edit the category
               descriptions, alter the number of categories, and
               add or alter the map's title.  Category files
               associated with raster map layers are stored under
               the cats directory in the user's current mapset.

     colr      A color file associates each category value in the
               raster map layer with a color.  Using r.support,
               the user may assign one of eight color table types

               to the raster map layer.  Map color table files
               are stored under the colr and colr2 directories
               under the user's current mapset.

     hist      Historical information about the raster map layer
               is stored in a history file.  The user may add or
               edit the raster map's title, data type, data
               source, data description, and include comments.
               (Note that the specification of map data type here
               is somewhat archaic, and should always be set to
               raster.) Map history files are stored under the
               hist directory under the user's current mapset.

NOTES
     The r.support program attempts to verify that the
     information in the cell header is reasonable.  The data
     format specified in the header is verified against the
     raster map layer itself.  This includes checking that files
     which the header indicates are compressed are really
     compressed, and that the number of rows and columns
     specified in the header correspond to the actual file size.

     The r.support program can also be used to determine the
     number of columns and rows of data in a raster map layer, in
     the event that no cell header is available.  This is useful,
     for example, for importing raster map layers created by
     software other than GRASS.

     If the file is not compressed, the file size should be the
     product of the number of rows and columns.  If the file is
     compressed, this test cannot be performed since the file
     size will bear no relation to the product.  The number of
     rows can still be verified, but the number of columns
     cannot.

     To compute or correct the stats, the cell header must be
     correct, since the raster map layer is read to determine the
     stats.

     If a new cats or colr (or colr2) file is required, the stats
     must be correct.

     The user is allowed to change the number of categories
     specified in the category file.  This should only be done if
     the user knows that the maximum category value in the raster
     map layer is different than that which is recorded in the
     category file.  Changing the category value in the cats file
     allows the user to add more category labels, or to remove
     labels.  It does NOT change the category values in the
     raster map layer itself.

     The color file is unique among GRASS support files.  While

     it is necessary to protect a user's original data from being
     modified by users working under other mapsets, these users
     need to be able to create color tables for maps that are
     stored under mapsets other than their own.  Color table
     files meet both these objectives.

     Color table files get stored in one of two directories, both
     under the user's current mapset.  The color files created by
     a user for raster maps stored under that user's current
     mapset get stored in the directory $LOCATION/colr and cannot
     be modified or removed by other users.  The color table
     files that the user modifies/creates for raster map layers
     not stored under the user's current mapset get stored in a
     secondary color file under the user's mapset.  This
     secondary color table is stored under
     $LOCATION/colr2/<mapset> where <mapset> is the name of the
     mapset under which the raster map data are stored.  In
     versions of GRASS prior to 3.0, this was also the case for
     color tables in the user's own mapset.  Now, however, if a
     user modifies a color table associated with a raster map
     layer in his own current mapset, these changes will be made
     to the user's original color file (i.e., the user's color
     changes will overwrite whatever previous color table file
     existed for this map under the user's $LOCATION/colr
     directory).  No secondary color files are created for raster
     map layers stored in the user's own mapset.

WARNING
     In order to modify the cell header, the raster (cell) map
     layer under consideration must not be a reclass file.  This
     is because the reclass file's header does not contain
     positional information, but rather a reference to another
     raster map layer.  Thus it shares a cell header with the
     referenced raster map layer.  In order to change the cell
     header, r.support must be run on the true raster file
     referenced.
