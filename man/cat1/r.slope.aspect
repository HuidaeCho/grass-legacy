     NAME r.slope.aspect - Generates raster map layers of slope,
     aspect, curvatures and partial derivatives from a raster map
     layer of true elevation values.

     (GRASS Raster Program)




     SYNOPSIS r.slope.aspect

     r.slope.aspect help

     r.slope.aspect [-aq] elevation=name [slope=name]
     [aspect=name] [format=name] [zfactor=value] [prec=name]
     [pcurv=name] [tcurv=name] [dx=name] [dy=name] [dxx=name]
     [dyy=name] [dxy=name]  [min_slp_allowed=value]




     DESCRIPTION r.slope.aspect generates raster maps of slope,
     aspect, curvatures and first and second order partial
     derivatives from a raster map layer of true elevation
     values. The user must specify the input elevation file name
     and at least one output file name. The user can also specify
     the format for slope (degrees, percent; default=degrees),
     and zfactor: multiplicative factor to convert elevation
     units to meters; (default 1.0).




     OPTIONS The program will be run non-interactively if the
     user specifies program inputs and any desired options on the
     command line, using the form r.slope.aspect [-aq]
     elevation=name [slope=name] [aspect=name] [format=name]
     [zfactor=value] [prec=name]  [pcurv=name] [tcurv=name]
     [dx=name] [dy=name] [dxx=name] [dyy=name] [dxy=name]
     [min_slp_allowed=value] If the user runs: r.slope.aspect
     without command line arguments, the program will prompt the
     user for flag settings and parameter values.


     Flags: Do not align the settings of the current geographic
     region (to which the output slope and aspect map layers will
     be set) to those of the elevation layer. See NOTES.  Run
     quietly, and suppress the printing of information on program
     operations during execution.

     The raster aspect map layer which is created indicates the
     direction that slopes are facing. The aspect categories
     represent the number degrees of east. Category and color
     table files are also generated for the aspect map layer. The
     aspect categories represent the number degrees of east and
     they increase counterclockwise: 90deg is North, 180 is West,
     270 is South and 360 is East.

     The resulting raster slope map layer will contain slope
     values, stated in degrees of inclination from the horizontal
     if format=degrees option (which is also default ) is chosen,
     and in percent rise if format=percent option is chosen. The
     category file, but not the color table, is generated by
     r.slope.aspect for the raster slope map layer.Profile and
     tangential curvatures are the curvatures in the direction of
     steepest slope and in the direction of the countour tangent
     respectively.  For some applications, the user will wish to
     use a reclassified map layer of slope that groups slope
     values into ranges of slope. This can be done using
     r.reclass. An example of a useful reclassification is given
     below:

			  (in degrees)	  (in percent)

		  1	    0-	1	      0-  2%
		  2	    2-	3	      3-  5%
		  3	    4-	5	      6- 10%
		  4	    6-	8	     11- 15%
		  5	    9- 11	     16- 20%
		  6	   12- 14	     21- 25%
		  7	   15- 90	     26% and higher

	  The following color table works well with the above
	  reclassification.

	       category	  red	green	blue

		  0	  179	 179	 179
		  1	    0	 102	   0
		  2	    0	 153	   0
		  3	  128	 153	   0
		  4	  204	 179	   0
		  5	  128	  51	  51
		  6	  255	   0	   0
		  7	    0	   0	   0



     NOTES To ensure that the raster elevation map layer is not
     inappropriately resampled, the settings for the current
     region are modified slightly (for the execution of the
     program only): the resolution is set to match the resolution

     of the elevation map and the edges of the region (i.e. the
     north, south, east and west) are shifted, if necessary, to
     line up along edges of the nearest cells in the elevation
     map. If the user really wants the elevation map resampled to
     the current region resolution, the -a flag should be
     specified.	 <p>The current mask, if set, is ignored.  <p>The
     algorithm used to determine slope and aspect uses a 3x3
     neighborhood around each cell in the elevation file. Thus,
     it is not possible to determine slope and aspect for the
     cells adjacent to the edges in the elevation map layer.
     These cells are assigned a "no data" value (category 0) in
     both the slope and aspect raster map layers.  <p>Because
     Horn's formula is used to find the derivatives in x and y
     directions, the aspect is biased in 0, 45, 90, 180, 225,
     270, 315, and 360 directions; i.e., the distribution of
     aspect categories is very uneven, with peaks at 0, 45,...,
     360 categories.

     Because most cells with a very small slope end up having
     category 0, 45,..., 360 it is sometimes possible to reduce
     bias in these directions by filtering out computation of
     aspect in areas where terrain is almost flat. The new option
     min_slp=value was added (minimum slope for which aspect is
     computed). The aspect for all cells with slope < min_slp is
     set to 0 (no value).


     WARNING the following may not be true anymore because of
     introduction of NULL, but it has not been tested
     <p>Elevations of zero (as well as below sea level
     elevations) are valid.  This means that areas assigned
     category value 0 may have one of two possible meanings: they
     may either be areas of "no data" or areas having 0
     elevation.	 <p>If the user wishes r.slope.aspect to assume
     that cells assigned category value zero in the elevation map
     layer represent true elevation values, not areas of "no
     data", the user should set the -z flag when running this
     program.  <p>If the -z flag is not set and the raster map
     layer of true elevation contains areas of "no data" that are
     assigned to category 0, either at its edges or in its
     interior, incorrect (and usually quite large) slopes will
     result.
