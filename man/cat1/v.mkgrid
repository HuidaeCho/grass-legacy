NAME
     v.mkgrid - Creates a (binary) GRASS vector map of a user-
     defined grid.
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.mkgrid
     v.mkgrid help
     v.mkgrid map=name grid=rows,columns coordinate=x,y
     box=length,width

DESCRIPTION
     v.mkgrid will create a binary format, vector map
     representation of a regular coordinate grid.

     Parameters:

     map=name		     Name to be assigned to binary vector
			     map layer output.

     grid=rows,columns	     Number of ROWS and COLUMNS to appear
			     in grid.

     coordinate=x,y	     Lower left EASTING and NORTHING
			     coordinates of vector map layer
			     output.

     box=length,width	     LENGTH and WIDTH of boxes in grid.

     If the user simply types v.mkgrid on the command line
     without specifying parameter values, the program will prompt
     the user for inputs using the standard interface described
     in the manual entry for parser.

NOTES
     The new binary vector map output is placed under the dig
     directory in the user's current mapset, and can be used like
     any vector map layer.  Run v.support to build the topology
     information for the vector map before using v.mkgrid map
     layer outputs in the v.digit program.

     Since the grid is computer-generated, the corner coordinates
     will be exact and can be used when patching together several
     v.mkgrid grids.

     This is NOT to be used to generate a vector map of USGS
     quadrangles, because USGS quads are not exact rectangles.
     To generate a vector map of USGS quads, use the program
     v.mkquads.

     The program ignores the current GRASS geographic region
     settings.	It will create the complete grid even if part of
