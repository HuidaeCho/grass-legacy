NAME
     r.report - Reports statistics for raster map layers.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.report
     r.report help
     r.report [-hmfqe] map=name[,name,...]
     [units=name[,name,...]] [pl=value] [pw=value] [output=name]

DESCRIPTION
     r.report allows the user to set up a series of report
     parameters to be applied to a raster map layer, and creates
     a report.  If invoked with command line arguments, the
     report will print out to the screen only.  However, output
     may be redirected to a file or another program using the
     UNIX redirection mechanism.  If invoked without command line
     arguments, the user is given the option of printing out each
     report and/or saving output to a file.

     The program will be run non-interactively, if the user
     specifies the names of raster map layers and any desired
     options on the command line, using the form

          r.report [-hmfqe] map=name[,name,...]
          [units=name[,name,...]] [pl=value] [pw=value]

     where each map name is the name of a raster map layer on
     which to report, each unit name is a unit of measure in
     which results are to be reported, the pl value gives the
     page length, the pw value gives the page width, and the
     (optional) flags -h, -e, -m, -f, and -q have the meanings
     stated below.


     Flags:

     -h                  Suppress the print-out of page headers.

     -m                  Report on zero values, because a mask is
                         being used.

     -f                  Use formfeeds between pages when
                         printing report output.

     -q                  Run quietly, without printing program
                         messages to standard output.

     -e                  Use scientific format for the numbers
                         that are too long to fit in the tab
                         table field if their decimal form is
                         used.

     -z                  Report only non-zero data values.  Zero
                         data will not be reported.  However, for
                         multiple map layers this means that if
                         zero values occur in every map layer,
                         they will not be reported; if non-zero
                         category values occur in any map layer
                         (along with zeros in others), the non-
                         zero values along with the zero values
                         will be reported.

     Parameters:

     map=name,name,...   Names of raster map(s) on which to
                         report.

     units=name          Units of measure in which results are to
                         be reported.  These units are based on
                         the number of cells in the user's area
                         of interest (i.e., cells within the
                         current geographic region definition,
                         and the current mask [if any]).  These
                         are established with the programs
                         g.region and r.mask, respectively.
                         Options:  Possible units of measurement
                         are:
                         mi   (cover measured in square miles)
                         me   (cover measured in square meters)
                         k    (cover measured in square
                         kilometers)
                         a    (cover measured in acres)
                         h    (cover measured in hectares)
                         c    (the number of cells in the area of
                         interest)
                         p    (the percent cover, excluding no
                         data areas)

     pl=value            Page length, in lines, in which report
                         will be output.
                         Default:  0   (lines)

     pw=value            Page width, in characters, in which
                         report will be output.
                         Default:  79   (characters)

     output=name         The name of a file to store the report
                         in. If not specified, the report is
                         printed on the terminal screen.


     Alternately, the user can simply type r.report on the
     command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for program flag settings and

     parameter values.

     The report itself consists of two parts, a header section
     and the main body of the report.

     The header section of the report identifies the raster map
     layer(s) (by map layer name and title), location, mapset,
     report date, and the region of interest.  The area of
     interest is described in two parts:  the user's current
     geographic region is presented, and the mask is presented
     (if any is used).

     The main body of the report consists of from one to three
     tables which present the statistics for each category and
     the totals for each unit column.

     Note that, unlike r.stats, r.report allows the user to
     select the specific units of measure in which statistics
     will be reported.

     Following is the result of a r.report run on the raster map
     layer geology (located in the Spearfish, SD sample data
     base), with the units expressed in square miles and acres.
     Here, r.report output is directed into the file report.file.

NOTES
     If the user runs r.report interactively and saves the report
     output in a file, this file will be placed into the user's
     current working directory.

     If the user runs r.report non-interactively, report output
     can be saved by redirecting it to a file or a printer using
     the UNIX redirection mechanism.
