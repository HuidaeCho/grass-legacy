v.circle <main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	  <main> v.circle



NAME
     v.circle -	Create a vector	file which consists of circle(s)
     which uses	each point in a	"site_lists" file as the center
     of	those circle(s).
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.circle
     v.circle help
     v.circle [-s] [radius=value] [radius_uom=name] [area=value]
	[area_uom=name]	sitefile=name output=name


DESCRIPTION
     "v.circle"	will create "polygon" circle(s)	around points
     read from an existing "site_lists"	file.  The "site_lists"
     point(s) will be the center(s) for	those circle(s)	with one
     circle created per	point.	The "polygon" circle(s)	will be
     written to	a binary vector	file.  Each "polygon" circle will
     have 361 points with each point on	the circumference of the
     circle representing 1 degree of arc.


COMMAND	LINE OPTIONS
     Flags

     -s	  Automatically	run "v.support"	on newly created vector
	  file.

     Parameters

     radius
	  Radius of circle(s) with "site_lists"	point(s) as
	  center(s).  If radius	selected then area values are not
	  used for computations.  If both radius and area
	  selected, then radius	has precedence over area.
	  default: 0.0

     radius_uom
	  Radius unit of measure,  ie. (m)meters,  ft(feet),
	  (mi)miles.
	  default: m

     area Area of circle(s) with "site_lists" point(s) as
	  center(s).  If area selected then radius values are not
	  used for computations.
	  default: 0.0

     area_uom
	  Area unit of measure,	 ie. sqm(square	meters),
	  ac(acres),  sqmi(square miles),  hec(hectares).
	  default: sqm
