NAME
     d.what.vect - Allows the user to interactively query the
     category contents of a (binary) vector map layer at user-
     selected locations within the current geographic region.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.what.vect
     d.what.vect help
     d.what.vect [-1] map=name

DESCRIPTION
     d.what.vect outputs the category value(s) associated with
     user-specified location(s) in a user-specified vector map
     layer.  This program currently returns only category values
     for line types in the user-specified vector file.

     The program will query the contents of the vector map layer
     named by the user on the command line.  This map layer must
     exist in the user's current mapset search path.

     The program activates the mouse, and expects the user to
     indicate the location(s) to be queried by depressing a mouse
     button over desired location(s) within the current
     geographic region in the active display frame on the graphic
     monitor.


     Flag:

     -1		       Identify and query just one point
		       location.  Only one mouse click is
		       executed.  This option is provided for
		       shell scripts and programs that want to
		       obtain only one point from the user.


     Parameter:

     map=name	       Name of an existing binary vector map in
		       the user's mapset search path.

EXAMPLE
     A sample d.what.vect session is given below.  Although it is
     not necessary that the user first display a vector map to be
     queried in the active display frame, it is helpful to have a
     map displayed there for reference.


     d.vect map=roads.24000
		       Displays the 1:24,000 scale roads vector
		       map layer on the graphics monitor.

d.what.vect <main>    GRASS Reference Manual   <main> d.what.vect



     d.what.vect map=roads.24000
		       After typing this, the user moves the
		       mouse to a desired location on the
		       displayed roads map layer, and presses the
		       left mouse button to query the category
		       value of the roads vector map at this
		       location.  The program then outputs the
		       category value of a line type
		       corresponding to this user-selected map
		       location, for the vector map queried by
		       the user.

		       The query may be repeated as often as
		       desired using the left mouse button.  The
		       right button on the mouse is used to quit
		       the d.what.vect session.

     Users can also use this program inside of shell scripts that
     require as input a map category value and a mouse button
     depressed.	 Users can set the -1 flag to run d.what.vect
     only once, and return only the map category value found and
     the number of the mouse button depressed.	(Mouse button
     return values are as follows:  0 indicates no button was
     pressed, 1 indicates that the left mouse button was pressed,
     2 indicates the middle button was pressed, and 3 indicates
     that the right mouse button was pressed.)

NOTES
     Currently, d.what.vect only outputs category values for
     lines.  It does not output category labels for lines, nor
     output category values or category labels for areas in a
     vector file.

     d.what.vect will always print its output to the user's
     terminal screen.  d.what.vect output can be redirected into
     a file; however, if it is, the output will go both to the
     screen and to the file.  For example:

	  d.what.vect map=roads > what.out

     will both send d.what.vect output to the screen and capture
     its output in the file named what.out.

     d.what.rast can be used to interactively query the map
     category contents of multiple raster map layers at user-
     selected locations.
