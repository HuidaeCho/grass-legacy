v.trim <main>        GRASS Reference Manual         <main> v.trim



NAME
     v.trim - Trims small spurs, and removes excessive nodes from
     a binary GRASS vector (dig) file.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.trim
     v.trim help
     v.trim input=name output=name [trim=value]

DESCRIPTION
     v.trim scans the user-specified GRASS vector input file and
     removes from it all lines having a length less than a user-
     specified trimming factor.  Excess nodes (those unnecessary
     to a line's definition) between line junctions are also
     removed.  The resulting vector output is sent to a user-
     named output file; the original vector input file is not
     modified by v.trim.

     The trimming factor parameter (trim=value) gives the user
     control over the size of small spurs or "dangling lines" to
     be removed.  The trimming factor is expressed in the same
     units (map coordinates) as the vector (dig) data within the
     user's current GRASS data base LOCATION (e.g.:  in meters
     for UTM locations; in pixels or cells for locations in an
     x,y coordinate system; etc.).

OPTIONS
     The user can run this program either non-interactively or
     interactively.  The program will be run non-interactively if
     the user specifies program arguments on the command line,
     using the form:

          v.trim input=name output=name [trim=value]

     If vector map input and output names are given on the
     command line, any other parameter values left unspecified on
     the command line will be set to their default values (see
     below).  Alternately, the user can simply type v.trim on the
     command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for needed parameter values using the
     standard GRASS user interface described in the manual entry
     for parser.

     Parameters:

     input=name        Name of an existing vector map layer in
                       the user's current mapset search path
                       containing lines to be "trimmed".

     output=name       Name of a new vector file to contained the
                       "trimmed" output.

v.trim <main>        GRASS Reference Manual         <main> v.trim



     trim=value        A user-specified trimming factor, denoting
                       the length of trimmed lines in map units.
                       All lines having a length less than this
                       trimming factor will be "trimmed" (i.e.,
                       removed) from the named vector input file.
                       Default:  10  (in units of meters or
                       cells)

NOTES
     v.support must be run on the vector input file prior to
     running v.trim.

     v.support must also be run on the resultant vector output
     file to build the needed topology information stored under
     the user's dig_plus directory.

     r.line maintains the same format (binary or ASCII) and
     attribute type (linear or area edge) as those of the
     original vector (dig) input file.

     A trimming factor of zero (0) will not remove any small
     spurs, but will remove all excess nodes.
