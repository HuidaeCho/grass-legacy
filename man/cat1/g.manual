g.manual <main>	      GRASS Reference Manual	  <main> g.manual



NAME
     g.manual - Accesses GRASS User's Reference Manual entries.
     (GRASS File Management Program)

SYNOPSIS
     g.manual
     g.manual help
     g.manual [-1aefs] [entries=name[,name,...]]

DESCRIPTION
     The g.manual command provides user access to the on-line
     GRASS User's Reference Manual entries.  The user may request
     a list of available manual entries, and may get a manual
     entry printed to the terminal screen and/or to the line
     printer.

     g.manual can be run either interactively or non-
     interactively.  If the user types

	  g.manual

     on the command line without program arguments, the program
     will prompt the user for a manual entry to display. The user
     may enter "list" to get a section-by-section listing of the
     manual entries available.	Once the user has viewed the
     desired information it may be printed by responding to the
     questions appropriately.

     The user can run the program non-interactively, by
     specifying the appropriate options and/or the name(s) of the
     manual entries to displayed.

OPTIONS
     -1	  This option will list all manual entries, one per line.

     -a	  This option will list all manual entries in a more
	  appealing format.  The manual page list will be
	  separated by manual section.

     -e	  This option tells g.manual to ignore empty manual
	  sections when printing the listings from the -1 or -a
	  options.

     -f	  This option will add formfeeds to output listing when
	  using the -a option.

     -s	  This option will cause g.manual to run silently.
	  Instead of displaying the manual page it will simply
	  set the exit status to:
	     0	 if entry exists, or
	     1	 if it does not exist.
