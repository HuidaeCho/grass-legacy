NAME
     v.area - Display GRASS area and perimeter information for
     GRASS vector map.
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.area
     v.area help
     v.area [-f] map=name [color=name]

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS program v.area first displays the selected vector
     file.  Then user can select area on map by clicking with
     mouse within the desired area.  Selected area will be
     highlighted in selected color on graphics display.	 On
     regular screen area information will be displayed, in square
     meters, hectares, acres, and square miles,	 Perimeter
     measurements, in meters, feet, and miles, are also
     displayed.

     User can repeatedly select areas for analysis, one at a
     time.

     Flag:

     -f		       Fill selected area with selected color on
		       graphics display, rather than simply
		       outlining it in the highlight color.


     Parameters:

     map=name	       Name of the vector map layer to be
		       displayed.

     color=name	       Color in which perimeter will be
		       highlighted.
		       Default:	 red


     If the user simply types v.area without specifying program
     arguments on the command line, the program will prompt the
     user for the name of a map.  Then the user is given the
     option of specifying a highlight color, and then, whether or
     not the display of selected area(s) is to be filled, rather
     than merely outlined, with the highlight color.
