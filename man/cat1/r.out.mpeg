NAME
     r.out.mpeg - Raster File Series to MPEG Conversion Program

GRASS VERSION
     4.x, 5.x

SYNOPSIS
     r.out.mpeg

     r.out.mpeg help

     r.out.mpeg [-qc] view1=name[,name,...]]

DESCRIPTION
     r.out.mpeg is a tool for combining a series of GRASS raster
     files into a single MPEG-1 (Motion Pictures Expert Group)
     format file.  MPEG-1 is a "lossy" video compression format,
     so the quality of each resulting frame of the animation will
     be much diminished from the original raster image.	 The
     resulting output file may then be viewed using your favorite
     mpeg-format viewing program.

     The user may define up to four "views", or sub-windows, to
     animate simultaneously.  e.g., View 1 could be rainfall,
     View 2 flooded areas, View 3 damage to bridges or levees,
     View 4 other economic damage, all animated as a time series.
     A black border 2 pixels wide is drawn around each view.
     There is an arbitrary limit of 100 files per view (100
     animation frames).	 Temporary files are created in the
     conversion process, so lack of adequate tmp space could also
     limit the number of frames you are able to convert.

     The environment variable GMPEG_SIZE is checked for a value
     to use as the dimension, in pixels, of the longest dimension
     of the animation image.  If GMPEG_SIZE is not set, the
     animation size defaults to the rows & columns in the current
     GRASS region, scaling if necessary to a default minimum size
     of 200 and maximum of 500.	 These size defaults are
     overridden when using the -c flag (see below).  The
     resolution of the current GRASS region is maintained,
     independent of image size.	 Playback programs have to decode
     the compressed data "on-the-fly", therefore smaller
     dimensioned animations will provide higher frame rates and
     smoother animations.

     UNIX - style wild cards may be used with the command line
     version in place of a raster file name, but it must be
     quoted.

     Example: r.out.mpeg view1="rain[1-9]","rain1[0-2]"
     view2="temp*"

     If the number of files differs for each view, the view with
     the fewest files will determine the number of frames in the
     animation.

OPTIONS
Flags:
     Quiet - suppress progress report.	Convert "on the fly",
     uses less disk space by using r.out.ppm with stdout option
     to convert frames as needed instead of converting all frames
     to ppm before encoding.  Only use when encoding a single
     view.  Use of this option also overrides any size defaults,
     using the CURRENTLY DEFINED GRASS REGION for the output
     size. So be careful to set region to a reasonable size prior
     to encoding.

Parameters:
     Raster file(s) for View1.	Raster file(s) for View2.  Raster
     file(s) for View3.	 Raster file(s) for View4.  Name for MPEG
     output file.  Default: gmovie.mpg Quality factor (1-5).
     Default: 3 A quality value of qual=1.

BUGS
     MPEG images must be 16-pixel aligned for successful
     compression, so if the rows & columns of the calculated
     image size (scaled, with borders added) are not evenly
     divisible by 16, a few rows/columns will be cut off the
     bottom & right sides of the image. The MPEG format is
     optimized to recognize image MOTION, so abrupt changes from
     one frame to another will cause a "noisy" encoding.

NOTES
     This program requires the program mpeg_encode:

     MPEG-1 Video Software Encoder
