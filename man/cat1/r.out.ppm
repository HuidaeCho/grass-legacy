r.out.ppm <main>     GRASS Reference Manual	 <main>	r.out.ppm



NAME
     r.out.ppm - Converts a GRASS raster file to a PPM image file
     at	the pixel resolution of	the CURRENTLY DEFINED REGION.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.out.ppm
     r.out.ppm help
     r.out.ppm -qG ] [ input=name ] [ output=name ]


DESCRIPTION
     r.flow The	PPM file created is 24bit color, rawbits storage
     by	default.  Using	-G, you	may force r.out.ppm to use 8bit
     greyscale instead.	 The greyscale conversion uses the NTSC
     conversion:  Y = .30*Red +	.59*Green + .11*Blue.  One pixel
     is	written	for each cell value, so	if ew_res and ns_res
     differ, the aspect	ratio of the resulting image will be off.

     Parameters:


     input=name	       Raster file to be converted.


     output=name       Name for	new PPM	file. (use out=- for
		       stdout) default:	<rasterfilename>.ppm


NOTES
     A few ppm file comments are written - the name of the GRASS
     raster file, resolution, etc.  Although these are perfectly
     legal, I've found one PD image utility that chokes	on them,
     so	if you need a commentless ppm file, use	out=- >
     outfile.ppm. (When	sending	output to stdout, no comments are
     written.)
