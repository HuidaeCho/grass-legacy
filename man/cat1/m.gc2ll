NAME
     m.gc2ll - Converts geocentric to geographic coordinates.
     (GRASS Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.gc2ll x=# y=# z=# s=spheroid

DESCRIPTION
     m.gc2ll returns geographic coordinates for geocentric ones
     supplied by the user.  It performs the reverse operation of
     the GRASS program m.ll2gc.	 The x, y and z values are the
     three dimensions needed to locate a point in three-
     dimensional space.	 The values that are printed include the
     latitude, the longitude and the height above (or distance
     below) the spheroid.

     The list of spheroids available is somewhat dynamic.  It may
     not contain exactly the ones listed below.	 To determine the
     current list of possible spheroids, simply type in:

	  m.gc2ll x=0 y=0 z=0 s=help

     A list of available spheroids will be printed on the screen.
     If the spheroid desired is not on the list, the values for
     the semi-major axis and the eccentricity squared for the
     spheroid may be entered in place of a spheroid name in the
     following format:

	  s=a=semi-major_axis,e=eccentricity_squared

     SOME POSSIBLE SPHEROIDS
     (The on-line listing includes only the spheroid names)

     For a brief discussion of geocentric coordinates see
     m.ll2gc.

     This is an experimental program.  It is part of an initial
     effort to incorporate geographic coordinates into GRASS.
