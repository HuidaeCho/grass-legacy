NAME
     d.text - Draws text in the active display frame on the
     graphics monitor.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.text
     d.text help
     d.text [size=value] [color=name] [line=value]

DESCRIPTION
     d.text draws text in the active display frame on the
     graphics monitor.  Text can be provided through standard
     input or redirected from a file (using the UNIX redirection
     mechanism).


     Parameters:

     size=value        Height of letters, stated as a percent of
                       the available display frame height.
                       Options:  0 - 100
                       Default:  5

     color=name        Sets display text color to name.
                       Options:  red, orange, yellow, green,
                       blue, indigo, violet, gray, white, and
                       black
                       Default:  gray

     line=value        The screen line number on which the first
                       line of text will be drawn.
                       (Line 1 is at the top of the active
                       display frame.)
                       Options:  1 - 1000
                       Default:  1

     In addition to the options provided on the command line,
     colors, text size, font type, and boldness, can be adjusted
     with commands in the standard input (i.e., if the user
     invokes d.text without options on the command line, and then
     assigns values to these options on lines within the standard
     input).  In this case, the user also sees the standard GRASS
     parser interface described in the manual entry for parser.

     Commands:
      .C color
     (where color is one of the available colors) causes text
     appearing on subsequent lines to be drawn in that color.

     Text size can be adjusted with the command:
      .S size

d.text               GRASS Reference Manual                d.text



     (where size is a percentage within the range 0 to 100).
     Note that a size of 10 would allow 10 lines to be drawn in
     the active display frame, 5 would allow the drawing of 20
     lines, and 50 would allow the drawing of 2 lines.

     Font type can be manipulated using the command:
      .F font
     (where font is one of the fonts known by the GRASS program
     d.font).  Available fonts are listed in the GRASS manual
     entry for d.font.  The default font type used (if
     unspecified by the user) is romans.  Run the GRASS macro
     show.fonts.sh to see what these fonts look like.

     The user can also stipulate that text be printed in bold on
     lines beneath the command:
      .B 1
     This command means bold on .
     Similarly, the command:
      .B 0
     turns bold off of all text appearing on lines beneath it.
     (Bold off is used by default, if unspecified by the user.)

EXAMPLE
     The following command will print the short phrase "This is a
     test of d.text" in the active display frame using the color
     yellow, in bold, and using 4/100'ths (4%) of the active
     frame's vertical space per line:

            d.text
            .C yellow
            .S 4
            .B 1
            This is a test of d.text

     The user presses control-d (the "ctrl" and "d" keys) to end
     input to d.text.

NOTES
     Note that the GRASS command d.title creates map titles in a
     format suitable for input to d.text.

     d.text needs escape sequences that can be used within lines
     to change colors, boldness, and perhaps size.
