NAME
     r.describe - Prints terse list of category values found in a
     raster map layer.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.describe
     r.describe help
     r.describe [-1rqd] map=name

DESCRIPTION
     r.describe prints a terse listing of category values found
     in a user-specified raster map layer.

     The program will be run non-interactively, if the user
     specifies the name of a raster map layer and any desired
     flags on the command line, using the form

          r.describe [-1rqd] map=name

     where the map name is the name of a raster map layer whose
     categories are to be described, and the (optional) flags -1,
     -r, -q, and -d have the meanings described below.

     Alternately, the user can simply type r.describe on the
     command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for needed flag settings and the
     parameter value using the standard GRASS parser interface
     described in the manual entry for parser.

PROGRAM USE
     The user can select one of the following two output reports
     from r.describe:

     (1) RANGE.  A range of category values found in the raster
     map layer will be printed.  The range is divided into three
     groups:  negative, positive, and zero.  If negative values
     occur, the minimum and maximum negative values will be
     printed.  If positive values occur, the minimum and maximum
     positive values will be printed.  If zero occurs, this will
     be indicated.

     (2) FULL LIST.  A list of all category values that were
     found in the raster map layer will be printed.

     The following sample output from r.describe:

          0 2-4 10-13

     means that category data values 0, 2 through 4, and 10
     through 13 occurred in the named map layer.

     The user must choose to read the map layer in one of two
     ways:

     (1) DIRECTLY.  The current geographic region and mask are
     ignored and the full raster map layer is read.  This method
     is useful if the user intends to reclassify or rescale the
     data, since these functions (r.reclass and r.rescale) also
     ignore the current geographic region and mask.

     (2) REGIONED and MASKED.  The map layer is read within the
     current geographic region, masked by the current mask.

NON-INTERACTIVE PROGRAM USE
     r.describe examines a user-chosen raster map layer.  If run
     non-interactively, the layer name must be supplied on the
     command line.

     A compact list of category values that were found in the
     data layer will be printed.

     Following is a sample output:

          0 2-4 10-13

     -1   Print the output one value per line, instead of the
          default short form.  In the above example, the -1
          option would output:

               0
               2
               3
               4
               10
               11
               12
               13


     -r   Only print the range of the data.  The highest and
          lowest positive values, and the highest and lowest
          negative values, are output. In the above example, the
          -r option would output:

               0 2 13

          If the -1 option is also specified, the output appears
          with one category value per line.

     -q   Quiet. The -q option will tell r.describe to be silent
          while reading the raster file.  If not specified,
          program percentage-completed messages are printed.

     -d   Use the current geographic region settings.  Normally,
          r.describe will read the data layer directly, ignoring
          both the current region settings and mask.  The -d
          option tells r.describe to read the map layer in the
          current region masked by the current mask (if any).

NOTES
     The range report will generally run faster than the full
     list.
