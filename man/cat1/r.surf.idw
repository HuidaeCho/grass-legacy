NAME
     r.surf.idw - Surface interpolation utility for raster map
     layers.

SYNOPSIS
     r.surf.idw [-e] input=name output=name [npoints=value]

DESCRIPTION
     r.surf.idw fills a grid cell (raster) matrix with
     interpolated values generated from a set of input layer data
     points.  It uses a numerical approximation technique based
     on distance squared weighting of the values of nearest data
     points. The number of nearest data points used to determined
     the interpolated value of a cell can be specified by the
     user (default:  12 nearest data points).

     If there is a current working mask, it applies to the output
     raster file.  Only those cells falling within the mask will
     be assigned interpolated values.  The search procedure for
     the selection of nearest neighboring points will consider
     all input data, without regard to the mask.

     The command line input is as follows:

     Flag:

     -e		       Error analysis option that interpolates
		       values only for those cells of the input
		       raster map which have non-zero values and
		       outputs the difference (see NOTES below).

     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of an input raster map layer
		       containing an incomplete set of data
		       values.	(i.e., some grid cells contain
		       known data values while the rest contain
		       zero (0)).

     output=name       Name to be assigned to new output raster
		       map that represents the surface generated
		       from the known data values in the input
		       layer.

     npoints=value     Number of nearest data points used to
		       determine the interpolated value of an
		       output raster cell.
		       Default:	 12

NOTES
     r.surf.idw is a surface generation utility which uses
     inverse distance squared weighting (as described in Applied

     Geostatistics by E. H. Isaaks and R. M. Srivastava, Oxford
     University Press, 1989) to assign interpolated values.  The
     implementation includes a customized data structure somewhat
     akin to a sparse matrix which enhances the efficiency with
     which nearest data points are selected.  For
     latitude/longitude projections, distances are calculated
     from point to point along a geodesic.

     Unlike r.surf.idw2, which processes all input data points in
     each interpolation cycle, r.surf.idw attempts to minimize
     the number of input data for which distances must be
     calculated.  Execution speed is therefore a function of the
     search effort, and does not increase appreciably with the
     number of input data points.

     r.surf.idw will generally outperform r.surf.idw2 except when
     the input data layer contains few non-zero data, i.e. when
     the cost of the search exceeds the cost of the additional
     distance calculations performed by r.surf.idw2.  The
     relative performance of these utilities will depend on the
     comparative speed of boolean, integer and floating point
     operations on a particular platform.

     Worst case search performance by r.surf.idw occurs when the
     interpolated cell is located outside of the region in which
     input data are distributed.  It therefore behooves the user
     to employ a mask when geographic region boundaries include
     large areas outside the general extent of the input data.

     The degree of smoothing produced by the interpolation will
     increase relative to the number of nearest data points
     considered.  The utility may be used with regularly or
     irregularly spaced input data.  However, the output result
     for the former may include unacceptable nonconformities in
     the surface pattern.

     The -e flag option provides a standard surface-generation
     error analysis facility.  It produces an output raster map
     of the difference of interpolated values minus input values
     for those cells whose input data are non-zero.  For each
     interpolation cycle, the known value of the cell under
     consideration is ignored, and the remaining input values are
     used to interpolate a result.  The output raster map may be
     compared to the input raster map to analyze the distribution
     of interpolation error.  This procedure may be helpful in
     choosing the number of nearest neighbors considered for
     surface generation.
