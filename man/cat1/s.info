NAME
     s.info - Reports attribute, label, and other information
     about a sites file.
     (GRASS Sites Program)

SYNOPSIS
     s.info
     s.info help
     s.info [-qwQ] sites=name

DESCRIPTION
     s.info reads the entire sites file and reports header &
     label information, type of category, number of attributes &
     dimensions, and min and max values for each dimension,
     attribute, or category.  For best results sites should
     conform to the multiple attribute format as specified in
     floating point GRASS.  This program can be run non-
     interactively or interactively.  If the user gives the name
     of a GRASS site_lists map and (optionally) specifies other
     parameter values on the command line the program will be run
     non-interactively;	 any parameter values left unspecified
     are set to their default values (see below).  Alternately,
     the user can type simply s.info on the command line; in this
     case, the program will prompt the user for parameter values
     using the standard GRASS parser interface described in the
     manual entry for parser.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flags

     -q	  Load quietly

     -w	  Only count sites in current window for min/max.

     -Q	  Show quartiles for decimal attributes

     Parameters

     sites
	  Name of sites file.


BUGS
     If the -Q flag is given, the sites are cached in order to
     determine quartile values; otherwise the sites are read
     sequentially without caching.  Therefore, use of the -Q
     option may result in an out-of-memory error for very large
     sites files.  The algorithm used to find quartile values
     matches that used by s.univar, so if the number of sites is
     not evenly divisible by 4, the resulting Q1 and Q3 values
     may not exist in the data, but is an average of the two

     neighboring values.  Likewise, if the number of sites is not
     evenly divisible by 2, the resulting median will be an
     average of its neighbors.
