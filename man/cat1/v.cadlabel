NAME
     v.cadlabel - Attaches labels to (binary) vector contour
     lines that have been imported to GRASS from DXF format.
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.cadlabel
     v.cadlabel help
     v.cadlabel lines=name labels=name

DESCRIPTION
     v.cadlabel attaches labels to index contour lines by using
     the index contour lines and labels files that have been
     converted from DXF format to GRASS vector format by the
     v.in.dxf program.  Users have the option of creating either
     binary or ASCII output with v.in.dxf.  Since v.cadlabel
     works only on binary vector files, the ASCII GRASS vector
     (dig_ascii) files that are generated by v.in.dxf must be
     converted to binary GRASS vector (dig) files using the
     v.in.ascii program before v.cadlabel can be executed.

     v.cadlabel searches a binary GRASS vector file of contour
     lines to find the contour lines that are closest to each box
     (contour label) in the binary GRASS vector file containing
     contour labels.  The two contour lines that are closest to a
     box are tagged with the same label (an elevation value) as
     that of the box.

OPTIONS
     Program parameters are described below.

     Parameters:

     lines=name        Name of the binary GRASS vector (dig)
                       file, imported from DXF format, that
                       contains index contour lines.

     labels=name       Name of the binary GRASS vector (dig_att)
                       file, imported from DXF format, that
                       contains index contour line labels.

NOTES
     Because line data that are created in CAD format may have
     unsnapped nodes or gaps, v.cadlabel will not always be able
     to label every index contour line.  Also, intermediate
     contour lines that may be contained in the index contour
     vector file (because they resided on the same DXF level as
     the index contour lines in the DXF design file) will not be
     labeled.  Any lines that are not labeled with v.cadlabel can
     be labeled with the contour labeling program in v.digit.

     If the intermediate contour lines are in a separate GRASS
     dig file, they can be patched to an labeled index contour
     file with the GRASS program v.patch, and then labeled in
     v.digit.

     The user does not need to v.patch the labels vector file
     (boxes) to the lines vector file (contour lines). The
     purpose of the labels vector file is to determine which
     labels should be assigned to which contour lines (in the
     lines vector file) during the execution of v.cadlabel.
