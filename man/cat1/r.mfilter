NAME
     r.mfilter - Raster file matrix filter.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.mfilter
     r.mfilter help
     r.mfilter [-qpz] input=name output=name filter=name
     [repeat=value] [title="phrase"]

DESCRIPTION
     r.mfilter filters the raster input to produce the raster
     output according to the matrix filter designed by the user
     (see FILTERS below).  The filter is applied repeat times
     (default value is 1).  The output raster map layer can be
     given a title if desired.	(This title should be put in
     quotes if it contains more than one word.)

OPTIONS
     The program can be run either non-interactively or
     interactively.  To run r.mfilter non-interactively, the user
     should specify desired flag settings and parameter values on
     the command line, using the form:

	  r.mfilter [-qpz] input=name output=name filter=name
	  [repeat=value] [title="phrase"]

     If the user specifies input, output, and filter file names
     on the command line, other parameters whose values are
     unspecified on the command line will be set to their default
     values (see below).

     Alternately, the user can simply type r.mfilter on the
     command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for flag settings and parameter values
     using the standard GRASS parser interface described in the
     manual entry for parser.

     Flags:

     -q		       r.mfilter will normally print messages to
		       indicate what is is doing as it proceeds.
		       If the user specifies the -q flag, the
		       program will run quietly.

     -z		       The filter is applied only to zero
		       category values in the input raster map
		       layer.  The non-zero category values are
		       not changed.  Note that if there is more
		       than one filter step, this rule is applied
		       to the intermediate raster map layer --
		       only zero category values which result

		       from the first filter will be changed.  In
		       most cases this will NOT be the desired
		       result.	Hence -z should be used only with
		       single step filters.

     Parameters:

     input=name	       The name of an existing raster file
		       containing data values to be filtered.

     output=name       The name of the new raster file to contain
		       filtered program output.

     filter=name       The name of an existing, user-created UNIX
		       ASCII file whose contents is a matrix
		       defining the way in which the input file
		       will be filtered.  The format of this file
		       is described below, under FILTERS.

     repeat=value      The number of times the filter is to be
		       applied to the input data.
		       Options:	 integer values
		       Default:	 1

     title="phrase"    A title to be assigned to the filtered
		       raster output map.  If the title exceeds
		       one word, it should be quoted.
		       Default:	 (none)



FILTERS
     The filter file is a normal UNIX ASCII file designed by the
     user.  It has the following format:

     TITLE	  title
     MATRIX	  n
		  .
     n lines of n integers
		  .
     DIVISOR	  d
     TYPE	  S/P


     TITLE     A one-line title for the filter.	 If a title was
	       not specified on the command line, it can be
	       specified here.	This title would be used to
	       construct a title for the resulting raster map
	       layer.  It should be a one-line description of the
	       filter.

     MATRIX    The matrix (n x n) follows on the next n lines.	n

	       must be an odd integer greater than or equal to 3.
	       The matrix itself consists of n rows of n
	       integers.  The integers must be separated from
	       each other by at least 1 blank.

     DIVISOR   The filter divisor is d.	 If not specified, the
	       default is 1.  If the divisor is zero (0), then
	       the divisor is dependent on the category values in
	       the neighborhood (see HOW THE FILTER WORKS below).

     TYPE      The filter type.	 S means sequential, while P mean
	       parallel.  If not specified, the default is S.

	       Sequential filtering happens in place.  As the
	       filter is applied to the raster map layer, the
	       category values that were changed in neighboring
	       cells affect the resulting category value of the
	       current cell being filtered.

	       Parallel filtering happens in such a way that the
	       original raster map layer category values are used
	       to produce the new category value.


     More than one filter may be specified in the filter file.
     The additional filter(s) are described just like the first.
     For example, the following describes two filters:


EXAMPLE FILTER FILE
     TITLE     3x3 average, non-zero data only, followed by 5x5 average
     MATRIX    3
     1 1 1
     1 1 1
     1 1 1
     DIVISOR   0
     TYPE      P

     MATRIX    5
     1 1 1 1 1
     1 1 1 1 1
     1 1 1 1 1
     1 1 1 1 1
     1 1 1 1 1
     DIVISOR   25
     TYPE      P

HOW THE FILTER WORKS
     The filter process produces a new category value for each
     cell in the input raster map layer by multiplying the
     category values of the cells in the n x n neighborhood
     around the center cell by the corresponding matrix value and

     adding them together.  If a divisor is specified, the sum is
     divided by this divisor, rounding to the nearest integer.
     (If a zero divisor was specified, then the divisor is
     computed for each cell as the sum of the MATRIX values where
     the corresponding input cell is non-zero.)

     If more than one filter step is specified, either because
     the repeat value was greater than one or because the filter
     file contained more than one matrix, these steps are
     performed sequentially. This means that first one filter is
     applied to the entire input raster map layer to produce an
     intermediate result; then the next filter is applied to the
     intermediate result to produce another intermediate result;
     and so on, until the final filter is applied.  Then the
     output cell is written.

NOTES
     If the resolution of the geographic region does not agree
     with the resolution of the raster map layer, unintended
     resampling of the original data may occur.	 The user should
     be sure that the geographic region is set properly.
