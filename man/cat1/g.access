NAME
     g.access - Controls user access to the current GRASS mapset.
     (GRASS File Management Program)

SYNOPSIS
     g.access

DESCRIPTION
     This program allows the user to control access to the
     current mapset.  Normally, any user can read data from any
     GRASS mapset.  But sometimes it is desirable to prohibit
     access to certain sensitive data.	The g.access command
     allows a user to restrict read and execute access to the
     current mapset (see UNIX chmod command).  g.access will not
     modify write access to the current mapset.

     The user may, for example, allow only users in the same UNIX
     group to read data files in the mapset, or restrict the
     mapset to personal use only.

     After typing
	  g.access
     the user will be presented with a screen page which reflects
     the current mapset permissions.  The user can then change
     them.  The screen page looks like:

     +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     LOCATION: spearfish			     MAPSET: demo	       |
     |									       |
     This program allows you to control access to your mapset by other users.  |
     Access may be granted/removed for everyone, or for everyone in your group.|
     |									       |
     Mark an 'x' to allow access;  erase the field to restrict access.	       |
     |									       |
     |	 GROUP: _x_							       |
     |	 OTHER: _x_							       |
     |									       |
     |		AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE	       |
     |			      (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)			       |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     If you remove the x (using the space bar), access will be
     denied to that class of user (group or other).  If you type
     an x, access will be granted to that class of user.

NOTES
     There is no non-interactive version of g.access.

     Under GRASS version 4.0, access to the mapset PERMANENT must
     be open to all users.  This is because GRASS looks for the
     user's default geographic region definition settings and the
     location title in files that are stored under the PERMANENT
     mapset directory.	The g.access command, therefore, will not

     allow you to restrict access to the PERMANENT mapset.

     The g.mapsets command isn't smart enough to tell if access
     to a specified mapset is restricted, and the user is
     therefore allowed to include the names of restricted mapsets
     in his search path.  However, the data in a restricted
     mapset is still protected;	 any attempts to look for or use
     data in a restricted mapset will fail.  The user will simply
     not see any data listed for a restricted mapset.
