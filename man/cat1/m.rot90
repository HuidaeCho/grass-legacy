NAME
     m.rot90 - Rotates elevation data extracted by either
     m.dted.extract or m.dmaUSGSread
     (GRASS Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.rot90
     m.rot90 help
     m.rot90 [-q] input=name output=name rows=value cols=value
     bpc=value

DESCRIPTION
     m.rot90 is used as a companion program to the DTED and DEM
     digital elevation data tape extraction programs
     m.dted.extract and m.dmaUSGSread.  m.rot90 rotates the
     contents of the output files generated by these tape
     extraction programs 90 degrees.  Rotation is necessary to
     compensate for the orientation of the data read from tape.
     This program can be used in conjunction with the program
     r.in.ll to convert this rotated data into GRASS raster map
     layer form.

     m.rot90 requires five inputs to be entered by the user.
     These parameters and the optional flag setting are described
     below.

     Flags:

     -q                Run quietly, suppressing output of
                       messages on program progress to standard
                       output.

     Parameters:

     input=name        The full pathname of an already-existing
                       file containing the data to be rotated.
                       This input file is usually the output file
                       created by m.dted.extract or
                       m.dmaUSGSread.

     output=name       Name to be assigned to the resultant,
                       rotated output file.  The full pathname of
                       the output file in which the rotated data
                       are to be stored.

     rows=value        The number of rows of data in the input
                       file.

     cols=value        The number of columns of data in the input
                       file.

     bpc=value         The number of bytes per cell in the input

                       file.

EXAMPLE
     The following command:

          m.rot90  input=/tmp/dma.out  output=/tmp/rot.out
          rows=301  cols=358  bpc=2

     will rotate the file /tmp/dma.out, and place the rotated
     file in /tmp/rot.out.  Here, the input file is 301 rows by
     358 columns, at 2 bytes per data value.

NOTES
     The user should note that since the output file is rotated
     90 degrees from the original input file, the rows and
     columns have been interchanged.  Hence, in the above
     example, the number of rows (301) and columns (358) stated
     by the user on the command line were those present in the
     input file.  The output file, however, will have 358 rows
     and 301 columns.
