NAME
     v.import  -  Converts ASCII Digital Line Graph (DLG) files,
     binary DLG files, and ASCII vector files into binary vector
     files and creates the needed vector support files.
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.import

DESCRIPTION
     v.import is an interactive program which runs other vector
     import programs.  It allows you to import DLG or ASCII
     vector files into GRASS vector format.  It also runs
     v.support.	 No arguments are required on the command line.
     However, before running v.import, the user should move the
     ASCII DLG files to be imported into GRASS in a directory
     named dlg under the user's current GRASS mapset (i.e., under
     the directory known to GRASS as $LOCATION).  If a dlg
     directory does not already exist under the user's current
     GRASS mapset, then the user will have to make one using the
     UNIX mkdir command, and then move the ASCII DLG files to be
     imported under that new dlg directory.

     This program performs all of the processes that are needed
     to convert ASCII Digital Line Graph (DLG) files, binary DLG
     files, and ASCII vector files into binary vector files.  It
     also creates two support files, the dig_plus file and the
     dig_att file (only created when importing DLG files).  The
     dig_plus file contains topological information obtained by
     analyzing the vector file.	 The dig_att file contains
     category (attribute) information files by the labeling
     function of the GRASS v.digit program.  All of the above
     files must be run through v.import before they can be used
     in the v.digit program of GRASS 4.0.

IMPORT FILES
     After entering the command v.import, the user will be asked
     for the type of file that is to be imported and for which
     support files will be created:

		   Import to GRASS Vector Format and Create Needed Support Files

	   1  -	  ASCII DLG file to GRASS Vector Format
	   2  -	  Binary DLG file to GRASS Vector Format
	   3  -	  ASCII VECTOR file to GRASS Vector Format
	   4  -	  Binary VECTOR file to GRASS Vector Format

     If numbers 1-3 are chosen, v.import will respond with the
     current data base units (in feet or meters), and ask if the
     new vector file is in the correct units for the data base
     location.	If the new vector file is not in the correct
     units, v.import will not allow it to be placed in the

     current data base location.  For each data base location,
     all map layers should have the same units.	 If, for some
     reason, a map layer uses different units than the rest of
     the map layers in the same data base location, a new data
     base location will have to be created for it.


ASCII DLG File to GRASS Vector Format:
     Convert an ASCII DLG file (such as those created in GRASS
     2.0) to a GRASS vector file and creates the dig_plus and
     dig_att support files.  The user is asked two questions:

	  1. Determine if this map is composed of Area or Line information.
	     Do you want to give precedence to Areas (opposed to Lines)? (y/n) [y]

	  NOTE: Some machine-processed DLG files do not make the
	  distinction between lines and area edges.  For example,
	  in a roads map, where the desired information is line
	  data, a downtown block surrounded by roads may be
	  processed as an area.	 Because of this, the user is
	  asked to choose whether to give precedence to areas or
	  lines.  If precedence is given to lines, the user
	  should be aware that any lines that bound unlabeled
	  areas in the DLG file will be stored as line data.  Any
	  unlabeled areas would therefore be lost (this is only a
	  concern when areas are unlabeled, labeled area
	  information will be retained).  If precedence is given
	  to areas, lines will be stored as boundaries to areas
	  that are unlabeled.

	  2. During the building of the Vector format:
	     Do you want to snap nodes to other nodes within a threshold (y/n) [n]

	  NOTE: BE CAREFUL!  This threshold is calculated using
	  the scale of the original DLG or dig file.  If the
	  threshold is too high, excessive snapping may occur,
	  destroying the file.	In general, users seldom need to
	  snap nodes.  If snapping of nodes is desired, the user
	  may want to run v.support separately.	 v.support allows
	  the user to set the snapping threshold.

     This process is done in three phases:
     1. The ASCII DLG file is converted to a binary DLG file.
     2. The binary DLG file is converted to a binary Vector file,
     and the dig_att support file containing attribute (category)
     information is created.
     3. The dig_plus support file is created by analyzing the
     vector file for topological information.


Binary DLG File to GRASS Vector Format:
     Converts binary DLG files (such as those created in GRASS

     2.0) to a vector file and creates the dig_plus and dig_att
     support files. The user is asked whether precedence should
     be given to Areas or Lines and if nodes should be snapped to
     other nodes within a calculated threshold.

     This process is done in two phases:
     1. The binary dlg file is converted to a binary vector file,
     and the dig_att vector support file containing attribute
     information is created.
     2. The dig_plus vector support file is created by analyzing
     the vector file for topological information.


ASCII Vector file to GRASS Vector Format:
     Converts ASCII vector files (such as those created in GRASS
     2.0) into GRASS binary vector files, and creates the
     dig_plus vector support file.  Since a vector maintains the
     distinction between lines and area edges, the user is not
     asked to give precedence to either.  However, the user will
     be asked if snapping from nodes to other nodes within a
     calculated threshold is desired.

     This process is done in two phases:
     1. The ASCII vector file is converted to a binary vector
     file, and the dig_plus vector support file is created.
     2. The dig_plus vector support file is created by analyzing
     the vector file for topological information.


Binary Vector file to GRASS Vector Format:
     Creates the dig_plus vector support file.

     This process is done in one phase:
     1. The dig_plus vector support file is created by analyzing
     the vector file for topological information.

NOTES
     Before running v.import, the user should move the ASCII DLG
     files to be imported into GRASS in a directory named dlg
     under the user's current GRASS mapset (i.e., under the
     directory known to GRASS as $LOCATION).  If a dlg directory
     does not already exist under the user's current GRASS
     mapset, then the user will have to make one using the UNIX
     mkdir command, and then move the ASCII DLG files to be
     imported under that new dlg directory.
