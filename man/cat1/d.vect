d.vect               GRASS Reference Manual                d.vect



NAME
     d.vect - Displays GRASS vector data in the active frame on
     the graphics monitor.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.vect
     d.vect help
     d.vect map=name [color=name]

DESCRIPTION
     d.vect displays the user-named binary vector file in the
     active display frame on the graphics monitor, in the user-
     named color.  The vector file must already exist under a
     mapset listed in the user's current mapset search path.

     This program can be run either non-interactively or
     interactively.  If the user gives the name of a binary
     vector map to be displayed and (optionally) specifies a
     color for vector display, the program will run non-
     interactively.  (If the user gives a vector map name but no
     vector color on the command line, the named vector map layer
     will be displayed in the default color white.) Alternately,
     the user can simply type d.vect on the command line; in this
     case, the program will prompt the user for parameter values
     using the standard GRASS parser interface described in the
     manual entry for parser.

     Parameters:

     map=name            Vector map layer to be displayed in the
                         active display frame.
                         Must be binary vector file in the user's
                         current mapset search path.

     color=name          Sets vector display color to name.
                         Options:  white, red, orange, yellow,
                         green, blue, indigo, violet, magenta,
                         brown, gray, and black
                         Default:  white

NOTES
     This program needs to be upgraded with features that would:
          1) Allow different line colors, weights, and textures
          to be assigned to vectors with different category
          values.
          2) Allow different fill patterns and colors to be
          assigned to areas.
          3) Be linked with an associated program identifying
          these options.
