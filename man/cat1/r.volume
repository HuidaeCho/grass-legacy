NAME
     r.volume - Calculates the volume of data "clumps", and
     (optionally) produces a GRASS site_lists file containing the
     calculated centroids of these clumps.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.volume
     r.volume help
     r.volume [-fq] data=name [clump=name] [site_list=name]

DESCRIPTION
     This program computes the cubic volume of data contained in
     user-defined clumps.  r.volume outputs:

          (1) The category value assigned to each clump formed by
          the clump map layer.  This value is stored under the
          "Cat Number" column (field 1) in the output table.
          (2) The average category value of the cells found in a
          data map that fall within the boundaries of each clump
          in a clump map.  The table stores this value under the
          "Average in Clump" column (field 2).
          (3) The summed total value of the category values
          assigned to the cells falling within each of these
          clumps.  This value is output under the "Data Total"
          column (field 3).
          (4) The number of cells from the data map that fall
          within the boundaries of each clump formed by the clump
          map layer.  This cell count is stored under the "#
          Cells in Clump" column (field 4) in the output table.
          (5,6) The centroid (easting and northing) of each
          clump.  These values are output under the "Centroid
          Easting" and "Centroid Northing" columns (fields 5 and
          6) in the output.
          (7) The total "volume" of each clump.  For each clump,
          the volume is calculated by multiplying the area of
          each cell by its category value, and taking the sum of
          this value for all cells within the clump.  Since, in
          GRASS, each cell in the data map will have the same
          cell dimensions (i.e., the same area), this is
          equivalent to multiplying the area of one cell by the
          "Data Total" column (field 3).
          (The area of each cell is equal to the product of its
          east-west resolution by its north-south resolution.
          See g.region.)

          Results are sent to standard output in the form of a
          table.  If the user sets the -f flag, this table will
          be output in a form suitable for input to such UNIX
          programs as awk and sed;  the table's columns are
          stored as colon-separated fields.  The user can also
          (optionally) elect to store clump centroids in a GRASS

          site_lists file.  A sample output report is shown
          below.

          r.volume works with the current geographic region
          definitions and respects the current MASK.

          The user can run r.volume non-interactively by
          specifying parameter values on the command line.  If
          the user omits parameter values from the command line,
          the program will prompt the user for input using the
          standard interface described in the manual entry for
          parser.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flags:

     -f                Generate unformatted output.  Output is in
                       a form suitable for input to UNIX programs
                       like awk; each column in the output is
                       separated by a colon.  Results are sent to
                       standard output.

     -q                Run quietly, suppressing the printing of
                       debugging messages to standard output.

     Parameters:

     data              Name of an existing raster map layer
                       containing the category values to be
                       summed.  The cell resolution (area) of the
                       data map will also be used.

     clump             Name of an existing raster map layer that
                       defines the boundaries of each clump.
                       Preferably, this map should be the output
                       of r.clump.  If the user has imposed a
                       mask, the program uses this mask as the
                       clump map layer if no other clump layer is
                       specified by the user.

     site_list         The name to be assigned to a new GRASS
                       site_lists file, in which clump centroids
                       can be stored.

                                              Total Volume = 67226740000.00

     For ease of example, it is assumed that each clump in the
     fields.only map layer is a field, that cell category values
     in the elevation map layer represent actual elevation values
     in meters, and that the data base is a UTM data base (in
     meters).  This means that field #1 (clump #1) contains 64
     cells;  the average elevation in field #1 is 1181.09 meters.
     The sum of all of the elevation values assigned to cells
     within field #1 is 75590 meters.  The volume (x*y*z) of
     space in field #1 is equal to 755900000 cubic meters.

     The "Data Total" column is the sum of the cell category
     values appearing in the elevation map layer, within each
     field of the fields.only map layer.  The Total Volume is the
     sum multiplied by the e-w resolution times the n-s
     resolution.

CENTROIDS
     The coordinates of the clump centroids are the same as those
     stored in the GRASS site_lists file (if one was requested).
     They are guaranteed to fall on a cell of the appropriate
     category;  thus, they are not always the true, mathematical
     centroids.  However, they will always fall at a cell center.

FORMAT OF SITE LIST
     For each line of above table the GRASS site_lists file
     reads:

          easting|northing|#cat v=volume a=average t=sum n=count

     This can be converted directly to a raster map layer in
     which each point is assigned to a separate category.

APPLICATIONS
     By preprocessing the elevation map layer with r.mapcalc and
     using suitable masking or clump maps, very interesting
     applications can be done with r.volume.  For instance, one
     can calculate:  the volume of rock in a potential quarry;
     cut/fill volumes for roads;  and, water volumes in potential
     reservoirs.  Data layers of other measures of real values
     can also be used.

NOTES
     The output is sent to the terminal screen.  The user can
     capture the output in a file using the UNIX redirection
     mechanism, as in the following example:

          r.volume d=data_map c=clump_map s=site_list > table.out

     Output can also be sent directly to the printer, as shown
     below:

          r.volume d=data_map c=clump_map s=site_list | lpr

     The user should be aware of what units of measurement the
     cell e-w and n-s resolution are in, and in what units the
     data map's cell category values are stated (since these
     three values will be multiplied together to produce the
     volume).

     This program respects the current mask, and uses this mask
     as the clump map layer if none is specified by the user.
