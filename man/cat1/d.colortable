d.colortable         GRASS Reference Manual          d.colortable



NAME
     d.colortable - To display the color table associated with a
     raster map layer.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.colortable
     d.colortable help
     d.colortable map=name [color=name] [lines=value] [cols=value]

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS program d.colortable is used to display the color
     table associated with a raster map layer in the active frame
     on the graphics monitor.  The map name should be an
     available raster map layer in the user's current mapset
     search path and location.

     Parameters:

     map=name          Name of a raster map layer in the user's
                       current mapset search path whose color
                       table is to be displayed.

     color=name        Color of the lines separating the colors
                       of the color table.
                       Options:  red, orange, yellow, green,
                       blue, indigo, violet, gray, white, and
                       black.
                       Default:  white

     lines=value       Number of lines to appear in the color
                       table.
                       Options:  1 - 1000

     cols=value        Number of columns to appear in the color
                       table.
                       Options:  1 - 1000

                       If the values of both lines and cols are
                       not specified by the user, d.colortable
                       divides the active frame equally among the
                       number of categories present in the named
                       raster map layer.  If one option is
                       specified, the other is automatically set
                       to accommodate all categories.  If both
                       are specified, as many categories as
                       possible are displayed.

     The user can specify all needed parameters on the command
     line using the form:

d.colortable         GRASS Reference Manual          d.colortable



          d.colortable map=name [color=name] [lines=value] [cols=value]

     If the user specifies the name of a map on the command line
     but does not specify the values of other parameters,
     parameter default values will be used.  Alternately, if the
     user types simply d.colortable on the command line without
     any program arguments, the program will prompt the user for
     parameter settings using the standard GRASS parser interface
     described in the manual entry for parser.

EXAMPLE
     The user running the command:

          d.colortable map=soils color=red lines=1 cols=3

     would see the active graphics frame divided into three
     columns extending the full frame height.  The lines dividing
     the color table associated with the soils map would be
     displayed in red.  The user would see, at most, only three
     of the colors from the soils color table displayed in the
     active frame (because the user requested that this frame be
     divided into three sections).

NOTES
     If the user wishes to display the entire color table
     associated with a map, the user should either stipulate a
     number of lines (rows) and columns (cols) sufficient to
     accommodate the number of categories in the map's color
     table, or fail to assign values to one or both of lines
     and/or cols.  If the user runs d.colortable using the
     default number of lines and columns (the full graphics
     frame), all categories from the map's color table will be
     displayed.  However, if the user requests that the color
     table associated with a map which has 10 data categories be
     displayed in a graphics frame with only 3 lines (rows) and 2
     columns (a total of six cells), only six of the ten map
     categories will be displayed.

     The user should run the command d.colormode mode=float
     before running d.colortable, for accurate display of the
     map's color table.

     The user should run the GRASS program d.erase between runs
     of d.colortable to avoid confusion.
