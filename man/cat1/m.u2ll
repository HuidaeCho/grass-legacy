NAME
     m.u2ll - Converts Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
     coordinates to geographic (latitude/longitude) coordinates.
     (GRASS Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.u2ll
     m.u2ll help
     m.u2ll [-srwod] spheroid=name [zone=value] [input=name]
     [output=name]

DESCRIPTION
     m.u2ll converts Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
     northings and eastings to geographic coordinates (i.e.,
     latitudes and longitudes).	 The user must specify the UTM
     coordinates to be converted and the spheroid on which the
     geographic coordinates will be based.  The program also
     needs to know the UTM zone in which the input coordinates
     are located.  However, if the user is running GRASS from a
     UTM data base LOCATION, m.u2ll will use this data base's UTM
     zone designation, if no zone is specified by the user.

     The GRASS program m.ll2u performs the reverse operation,
     converting geographic coordinates to UTM coordinates.

     The list of spheroids available is somewhat dynamic.  At the
     time of this release, available spheroids included: airy,
     australian, bessel, clark66, everest, grs80, hayford,
     international, krasovsky, wgs66, wgs72, and wgs84 (see table
     below).

     This command can be run either non-interactively or
     interactively.  The user can run the program non-
     interactively by entering desired flag settings and
     parameter values on the command line using the following
     format:

	  m.u2ll [-srwod] spheroid=name [zone=value] [input=name]
	  [output=name]

     Alternately, the user can simply type:

	  m.u2ll

     on the command line.  In this case, the user will be
     prompted for parameter values and flag settings through the
     standard interface described in the manual entry for parser.

     Input can be entered from the keyboard or from an input
     file.  In either case, input should be entered with one UTM
     easting and northing pair per line, in the format shown
     below:

	  easting northing
	  easting northing
	  easting northing
	  easting northing
	    .
	    .
	  end

     If the user sets the -r flag, m.u2ll will expect the order
     of the coordinates to be reversed, and stated as northing,
     easting pairs, rather than as easting, northing pairs.  This
     is useful for passing ASCII GRASS vector (/dig) files, whose
     coordinates are stated as northing, easting pairs, directly
     through m.u2ll.

     Similarly, the user can elect to send output to an output
     file or (by default) to standard output (the user's terminal
     screen).  Example input and output are shown below (see
     EXAMPLE).

     Program flag settings and parameters have the following
     meanings.

     Flags:

     -s		       Specified UTM zone is in the southern
		       hemisphere.

     -r		       The order of coordinates is reversed in
		       the input, and entered as:  north east.
		       This option allows the user to pass an
		       ascii vector file through m.u2ll.

     -w		       Do not flag invalid east, north input
		       lines as errors.

     -o		       Flag other invalid input lines as errors.

     -d		       Output latitude/longitude values in
		       decimal degrees, rather than in the form
		       dd:mm:ss.

     Parameters:

     spheroid=name     Reference spheroid (ellipsoid).
		       Options:	 airy, australian, bessel,
		       clark66, everest, grs80, hayford,
		       international, krasovsky, wgs66, wgs72,
		       wgs84

     zone=value	       UTM zone in which UTM coordinates are
		       located.

EXAMPLE
     Assume the user has input the command:

	  m.u2ll  -s  spheroid=wgs72  zone=4  input=utm.infile
	  output=ll.outfile

     where the input file utm.infile contains the following
     easting and northing UTM coordinate values and zone
     designations:

	  237740.85 2167292.10
	  238740.00 2167000.00
	  239000.00 2167100.00
	  237100.00 2166000.00
	  end

     Output would then be sent to the output file ll.outfile,
     containing the below longitude and latitude coordinate
     values:

	  166:02:25.645137W 70:27:46.615528S
	  166:00:53.237056W 70:27:59.692673S

	  166:03:41.428895W 70:28:25.61617S

NOTES
     Users can add information to the ellipsoid parameter
     definition file on their systems (located in
     $GISBASE/etc/ellipse.table) to add spheroids not now among
     those supported by GRASS.

     See m.ll2u for a brief discussion of spheroids.

     The UTM zone designation determines on what area of the
     earth a point is found.  The same UTM coordinates will be
     found in each different UTM zone.	Look at the marginalia of
     your source map to determine into which UTM zone your UTM
     coordinates fall.	Although the user can permissibly omit
     specification of a UTM zone when running this program under
     a UTM data base LOCATION, it is safer to specify it (see
     DESCRIPTION, above).

     m.u2ll converts the first pair of coordinates on each line
     of input and leaves anything else on the line alone.  If a
     line begins:

	  xxxxxx.xx xxxxxxx.xx

     then the xxxxxx.xx xxxxxxx.xx UTM coordinate pair is
     converted to a longitude, latitude pair.  Any other
     information appearing on the line is left alone.  If the
     line doesn't begin with a pair of coordinates in the above
     format, then the line is left as it is.
