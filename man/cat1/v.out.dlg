NAME
     v.out.dlg - Converts binary GRASS vector data to DLG-3
     Optional vector data format.
     (GRASS Vector Data Export Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.out.dlg
     v.out.dlg help
     v.out.dlg input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS program v.out.dlg allows the user to convert GRASS
     vector data to DLG-3 Optional format, for export to other
     systems.

     The user can run the program non-interactively by specifying
     all program arguments on the command line, in the form:

	  v.out.dlg input=name output=name

     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of the binary GRASS vector data file
		       to be converted to DLG-3 format.

     output=name       Name to be assigned to the DLG-3 Optional
		       format output file created.

     If the user does not give the names of an input and output
     file on the command line, the program will prompt the user
     to enter these names.

NOTES
     The v.out.dlg program requires that the input vector map
     layer have full topological information associated with it.
     This means that the GRASS program v.support should have been
     the last program to have effected any changes upon the
     vector map layer before it is run through v.out.dlg.  If
     this is not the case, v.out.dlg will terminate with a
     message that v.support needs to be run.

     The output from v.out.dlg will be placed in $LOCATION/dlg.
