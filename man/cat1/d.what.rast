d.what.rast          GRASS Reference Manual           d.what.rast



NAME
     d.what.rast - Allows the user to interactively query the
     category contents of multiple raster map layers at user-
     specified locations within the current geographic region.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.what.rast
     d.what.rast help
     d.what.rast [-1t] [map=name[,name,...]] [fs=name]

DESCRIPTION
     d.what.rast outputs the category values and labels
     associated with cell(s) at user-specified location(s) on
     user-named raster map layer(s).

     The program will query the contents of raster map layer(s)
     named by the user on the command line.  These map layers
     must exist in the user's current mapset search path.  If the
     user does not name any raster map layers on the command
     line, d.what.rast will query the category contents of
     whatever raster map layer is already displayed in the active
     frame on the graphics monitor.

     The program activates the mouse, and expects the user to
     indicate the cell location(s) to be queried by depressing a
     mouse button over desired location(s) within the current
     geographic region in the active display frame on the graphic
     monitor.

     Flags:

     -1                Identify and query just one point
                       location.  Only one mouse click is
                       executed.  This option is provided for
                       shell scripts and programs that want to
                       obtain only one point from the user.

     -t                Provide only terse output.  This option is
                       provided to simplify the parsing of output
                       by other programs.


     Parameters:

     map=name          Name of existing raster map layer(s).
                       Limit: 15 maps
                       Default:  Query map currently displayed in
                       the active graphics frame.

     fs=name           Output field separator to be used (in
                       terse mode only).

                       Default:  :

     d.what.rast output consists of the geographic coordinates of
     the location pointed to, and, for each map layer, the map
     layer name, the category value, and category label in the
     named raster map layers at this location.

EXAMPLE
     It is helpful, but not necessary, to first display a map to
     be used for reference in the active display frame before
     running d.what.rast.  For example, the user might type the
     following series of commands and receive the output below.


     d.rast map=soils
                       To first display the soils map in the
                       active frame.


     d.what.rast map=soils,aspect
                       User then moves the mouse to desired
                       location on the displayed soils map layer,
                       and presses the left mouse button to query
                       the category contents of the soils and
                       aspect maps at this geographic location.
                       The program then outputs the below
                       information to the user's terminal.

                       617112(E) 3732014(N)
                       soils in PERMANENT (44)Nunn clay loam, NdC
                       aspect in PERMANENT (20)15 degrees north of west


     The first line of output gives the easting (E) and northing
     (N) coordinates of the geographic location at which the user
     clicked the mouse.  The subsequent two lines give the map
     name and mapset, map category value (within parentheses),
     and map category label corresponding to this user-selected
     map location, for each of the maps queried by the user.

     The query may be repeated as often as desired using the left
     mouse button.  The right button on the mouse is used to quit
     the d.what.rast session.

     Users can set the -t flag to obtain a terse output from
     d.what.rast.  This is useful when the user wishes output to
     be parsed by another program (like awk).  If the -t flag is
     set, users can also select the field separator used (with
     the fs=name option), or elect to use the default : field
     separator.  In this case, the command

     d.what.rast -t map=soils,aspect

d.what.rast          GRASS Reference Manual           d.what.rast



                       produces output in the form shown below.
                       The first line of output gives the
                       easting, northing, and the mouse button
                       return value (see NOTES, below).  Each
                       subsequent line gives the map name and its
                       mapset, the category value, and category
                       label of the point specified on the user-
                       named raster map layers.  The default
                       output field separator, a colon, is used
                       since none was specified on the command
                       line.

                                     617112:3732014:1
                       soils@PERMANENT:44:Nunn clay loam, NdC
                       aspect@PERMANENT:20:15 degrees north of west


     Users can also use this program inside of shell scripts that
     require as input a map category value and a mouse button
     depressed.  Users can choose an option to run d.what.rast
     only once, and return only the map category value found and
     the number of the mouse button depressed.

NOTES
     Mouse button return values are as follows:  0 indicates no
     button was pressed, 1 indicates that the left mouse button
     was pressed, 2 indicates the middle button was pressed, and
     3 indicates that the right mouse button was pressed.

     d.what.rast will always print its output to the terminal
     screen.  d.what.rast output can be redirected into a file;
     however, if it is, the output will go both to the screen and
     to the file.  For example:

          d.what.rast map=soils,aspect > what.out

     will both send d.what.rast output to the screen and capture
     its output in the file named what.out.

     The maximum number of raster map layers that can be queried
     at one time is 15.

     d.what.vect allows the user to interactively query the
     category contents of multiple vector map layers at user-
     specified locations.
