NAME
     r.random - Creates a raster map layer and site list file
     containing randomly located sites.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.random
     r.random help
     r.random [-qz] input=name nsites=number[%]
     [raster_output=name] [sites_output=name]

DESCRIPTION
     The program r.random allows the user to create a raster map
     layer and a site list file containing geographic coordinates
     of points whose locations have been randomly determined.
     The program locates these randomly generated sites within
     the current geographic region and mask (if any), on non-zero
     category value data areas within a user-specified raster map
     layer.  If the user sets the -z flag, sites will be randomly
     generated across all cells (even those assigned category
     value 0).

     The raster_output raster map layer is created in the user's
     current mapset.  The category values and corresponding
     category names already associated with the random site
     locations in the input map layer are assigned to these sites
     in the raster_output map layer.

     The site_lists file created by r.random contains a listing
     of the sites' geographic coordinates;  these coordinates are
     the center points of the randomly selected cells.

OPTIONS
     The user may specify the quantity of random locations to be
     generated either as a positive integer (e.g., 10), or as a
     percentage of the raster map layer's total area (e.g., 10%,
     or 3.05%).	 If unspecified, the number of sites is set to
     '0' by default.  If stated as a percentage of the raster
     map's total size, the number of random locations generated
     will be set equal to the number of cells contained within
     the stated percentage of the raster map layer.  Options are
     0-100;  percentages less than one percent may be stated as
     decimals.	The default percentage value used, if unspecified
     by the user, is '0'.  (Note that choosing 1% of a raster
     map's cells frequently produces an abundance of random
     locations.)

     r.random can be run interactively or non-interactively.  The
     user may provide program arguments on the command line,
     specifying an input map layer name (input=name), output
     raster map layer name (raster_output=name), output site list
     file name (sites_output=name), and (optionally) give the

     number of sites to be randomly generated as a total number
     of sites (nsites=number) or as a percentage of the map's
     size (nsites=number%).  The user can also direct that
     r.random run quietly (using the -q) option, and/or direct
     r.random to also generate random site locations against
     cells containing category zero (using the -z option).

     Alternately, the user can simply type r.random on the
     command line without program arguments.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for needed inputs and option choices
     using the standard GRASS user interface described in the
     manual entry for parser.

     Flags:

     -q		       Run quietly.  r.random will normally print
		       output messages to standard output as it
		       runs. The -q option will suppress the
		       printing of these messages.

     -z		       Include areas assigned a category value of
		       zero within the pool of areas within which
		       r.random will randomly generate site
		       locations.  If the -z option is specified,
		       sites that fall in areas assigned a
		       category value of zero in the input map
		       layer will be assigned to a newly-created
		       category in the output raster map layer.
		       If the -z flag is not set, cells having
		       category value 0 in the output layer will
		       represent the areas at which randomly-
		       located sites were not placed.

     Parameters:

     input=name	       An existing raster map layer in the user's
		       current mapset search path.  r.random will
		       randomly generate sites on a user-
		       specified portion of the cells in this
		       input raster map.

     nsites=number  or	nsites=number%
		       Allows the user to specify the quantity of
		       sites to be randomly generated as either a
		       positive integer, or as a percentage value
		       of the number of cells in the input map
		       layer.  If stated as a positive integer,
		       number is the number of sites (i.e.,
		       number of cells) to appear in the
		       raster_output layer and/or sites_output
		       file.
		       Options:	 Non-percentage values should be

		       given as positive integer values less than
		       or equal to the number of cells in the
		       input map layer.	 Percentage values given
		       should be within the range 0.00 - 100.00
		       (decimal values are allowed).

     raster_output=name
		       The new raster map layer to hold program
		       output.	This map will contain the sites
		       randomly generated by r.random.	If the -z
		       flag is not set, all sites will be
		       assigned whatever category values were
		       assigned these cell locations in the input
		       raster map layer.  If the -z flag is set,
		       all sites except those falling on cells
		       assigned category value 0 in the input
		       value will be assigned the category values
		       assigned these cells in the input layer;
		       sites falling on cells assigned category
		       value 0 in the input layer will be
		       assigned to a newly created category in
		       the raster_output layer.

     sites_output=name The new GRASS site_lists file to hold
		       program output.	If no sites_output file
		       name is given on the command line, no
		       site_lists file will be created by
		       r.random.  (See raster_output parameter
		       description, above.)

		       Note.  Although the user need not request
		       that r.random output both a raster map
		       layer (raster_output) and a site list file
		       (sites_output), the user must specify that
		       at least one of these outputs be produced.

NOTES
     To create random site locations within some, but not all,
     non-zero categories of the input raster map layer, the user
     must first create a reclassified raster map layer of the
     original raster map layer (e.g., using the GRASS program
     r.reclass) that contains only the desired categories, and
     then use the reclassed raster map layer as input to
     r.random.
