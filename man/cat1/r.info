NAME
     r.info - Outputs basic information about a user-specified
     raster map layer.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.info
     r.info help
     r.info map=name

DESCRIPTION
     r.info reports some basic information about a user-specified
     raster map layer.	This map layer must exist in the user's
     current mapset search path.  Information about the map's
     boundaries, resolution, projection, data type, category
     number, data base location and mapset, and history are put
     into a table and written to standard output.  The types of
     information listed can also be found in the /cats, /cellhd,
     and /hist directories under the mapset in which the named
     map is stored.

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies the name of a raster map layer on the command
     line, using the form:

	  r.info map=name

     where name is the name of a raster map layer on which the
     user seeks information.  The user can save the tabular
     output to a file by using the UNIX redirection mechanism
     (<);  for example, the user might save a report on the soils
     map layer in a file called soil.rpt by typing:

	  r.info map=soils > soil.rpt

     Alternately, the user can simply type r.info on the command
     line, without program arguments.  In this case, the user
     will be prompted for the name of a raster map layer using
     the standard GRASS parser interface described in the manual
     entry for parser.	The user is asked whether he wishes to
     print the report and/or save it in a file.	 If saved, the
     report is stored in a user-named file in the user's home
     directory.

     Below is the report produced by r.info for the raster map
     geology in the Spearfish sample data base.
