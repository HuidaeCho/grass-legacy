i.tape.mss.h         GRASS Reference Manual          i.tape.mss.h



NAME
     i.tape.mss.h - An imagery function that extracts header
     information from LANDSAT Multispectral Scanner (MSS) imagery
     data stored on half-inch tape.
     (GRASS Image Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     i.tape.mss.h
     i.tape.mss.h help
     i.tape.mss.h tape_drive_name

DESCRIPTION
     i.tape.mss.h reads the header information on a Multispectral
     Scanner (MSS) tape.  This program reads the specified input
     file (the computer-compatible tape tape_drive_name), and by
     default displays the output to the user's terminal.  The
     user may redirect output to a file by using the UNIX
     redirection mechanism.  For example:

          i.tape.mss.h /dev/rmt0 > h.out

     The name of the tape drive depends on the computer being
     used.

     This program can be run either non-interactively or
     interactively.  The user can run the program by specifying
     program arguments on the command line.  Alternately, the
     user can simply type i.tape.mss.h on the command line,
     without program arguments.  In this event, the program will
     prompt the user to enter a tape device name using the
     standard user interface described in the manual entry for
     parser.
