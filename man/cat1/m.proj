NAME
     m.proj - Calculates conversion coordinates	for geographic
     positions.
     (GRASS Map	Development Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.proj
     m.proj help

DESCRIPTION
     This program allows a user	to interactively:  convert
     coordinates from one projection to	another

     It	allows a user to do all	of the above:  reading from a
     file, writing to the screen,  or reading from the keyboard,
     writing to	a file,	or reading from	a file,	writing	to a
     file,

     Note:  The	program	does not transform GRASS files,	it is
     designed to determine coordinate values on	an individual
     position.

     The map projections currently supported are listed	in
     etc/projections file

     Each of the above projections (with the exception of State
     Plane) can	be computed with the spheroids listed in
     etc/ellipse.table file


INPUT FILE FORMAT
     When reading from a file of LATITUDE/LONGITUDE data the file
     will contain three	(2) columns of information:
     the first column -	latitude   - in	degrees	minutes	seconds,
     the second	column - longitude - in	degrees	minutes	seconds,

     For example:
	       +40 36 31.4563	-87 2 7.8193
	       40n 36 31.4563	87w 2 7.8193

     When reading from a file of PROJECTION COORDINATES	data the
     file will contain three (2) columns of information:
     the first column -	easting	- ground coordinates
     the second	column - northing - ground coordinates

     For example:
	       500000.00    4496918.64
	       -424489.11   1908736.13

     Note: NO column headings are required, just the numbers.
