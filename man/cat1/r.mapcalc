     _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c performs arithmetic on raster map layers.  New
     raster map layers can be created which are arithmetic
     expressions involving existing raster map layers, integer or
     floating point constants, and functions.

     If used without command line arguments, _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c will read
     its input, one line at a time, from standard input (which is
     the keyboard, unless redirected from a file or across a
     pipe).  Otherwise, the expression on the command line is
     evaluated.  _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c expects its input to have the form:

          rreessuulltt==_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n

     where _r_e_s_u_l_t is the name of a raster map layer to contain
     the result of the calculation and _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n is any legal
     arithmetic expression involving existing raster map layers,
     integer or floating point constants, and functions known to
     the calculator.  Parentheses are allowed in the expression
     and may be nested to any depth.  _r_e_s_u_l_t will be created in
     the user's current mapset.

     The formula entered to _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c by the user is recorded
     both in the _r_e_s_u_l_t map title (which appears in the category
     file for _r_e_s_u_l_t) and in the history file for _r_e_s_u_l_t.

     Some characters have special meaning to the command shell.
     If the user is entering input to _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c on the command
     line, expressions should be enclosed within single quotes.

     if the comparison is true, 0 otherwise.

     Anything in the expression which is not a number, operator,
     or function name is taken to be a raster map layer name.
     Examples:

          elevation   x3   3d.his

     Most GRASS raster map layers meet this naming convention.
     However, if a raster map layer has a name which conflicts
     with the above rule, it should be quoted.  For example, the
     expression

          x = a-b

     would be interpreted as:  x equals a minus b, whereas

          x = "a-b"

     would be interpreted as:  x equals the raster map layer
     named _a_-_b

     Also

          x = 3107

     would create _x filled with the number 3107, while

          x = "3107"

     would copy the raster map layer _3_1_0_7 to the raster map layer
     _x.

     Quotes are not required unless the raster map layer names
     look like numbers or contain operators, OR unless the
     program is run non-interactively.  Examples given here
     assume the program is run interactively.  See NOTES, below.

     _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c will look for the raster map layers according to
     the user's current mapset search path.  It is possible to
     override the search path and specify the mapset from which
     to select the raster map layer.  This is done by specifying
     the raster map layer name in the form:

          name@mapset

     For example, the following is a legal expression:

          result = x@PERMANENT / y@SOILS

     The mapset specified does not have to be in the mapset
     search path.  (This method of overriding the mapset search
     path is common to all GRASS commands, not just _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c.)

     Maps and images are data base files stored in raster format,
     i.e., two-dimensional matrices of integer values.  In
     _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c, maps may be followed by a _n_e_i_g_h_b_o_r_h_o_o_d modifier
     that specifies a relative offset from the current cell being
     evaluated.  The format is _m_a_p_[_r_,_c_], where _r is the row
     offset and _c is the column offset.  For example, _m_a_p_[_1_,_2_]
     refers to the cell one row below and two columns to the
     right of the current cell, _m_a_p_[_-_2_,_-_1_] refers to the cell two
     rows above and one column to the left of the current cell,
     and _m_a_p_[_0_,_1_] refers to the cell one column to the right of
     the current cell.  This syntax permits the development of
     neighborhood-type filters within a single map or across
     multiple maps.

     Sometimes it is desirable to use a value associated with a
     category's _c_o_n_t_e_n_t_s instead of the category value itself.
     If a raster map layer name is preceded by the @@ operator,
     then the labels in the category file for the raster map
     layer are used in the expression instead of the category
     value.

     For example, suppose that the raster map layer _s_o_i_l_._p_h
     (representing soil pH values) has a category file with

     labels as follows:

          cat   label
          --------------
          0     no data

          1     1.4
          2     2.4
          3     3.5
          4     5.8
          5     7.2
          6     8.8
          7     9.4

     Then the expression:

          result = @soils.ph * 10

     would produce a result with category values 0, 14, 24, 35,
     58, 72, 88 and 94.

     Note that this operator may only be applied to raster map
     layers and produces a floating point value in the
     expression.  Also the category label must start with a valid
     number.  Missing labels, or labels that do not start with a
     number will (silently) produce a 0 value for that category.

     It is often helpful to manipulate the colors assigned to map
     categories.  This is particularly useful when the spectral
     properties of cells have meaning (as with imagery data), or
     when the map category values represent real quantities (as
     when category values reflect true elevation values).  Map
     color manipulation can also aid visual recognition, and map
     printing.

     The # operator can be used to either convert map category
     values to their grey scale equivalents or to extract the
     red, green, or blue components of a raster map layer into
     separate raster map layers.

          result = #map

     converts each category value in _m_a_p to a value in the range
     0-255 which represents the grey scale level implied by the
     color for the category.  If the map has a grey scale color
     table, then the grey level is what #map evaluates to.
     Otherwise, it is computed as:

           .18 * red + .81 * green + .01 * blue

     The # operator has three other forms:  r#map, g#map, b#map.
     These extract the red, green, or blue components in the
     named raster map, respectively.  The GRASS shell script
     _b_l_e_n_d_._s_h extracts each of these components from two raster
     map layers, and combines them by a user-specified
     percentage.  These forms allow color separates to be made.
     For example, to extract the red component from _m_a_p and store
     it in the new 0-255 map layer _r_e_d, the user could type:

          red = r#map

     To assign this map grey colors type:

          r.colors map=red color=rules
          black
          white

     To assign this map red colors type:

          r.colors map=red color=rules

     Floating point numbers are allowed in the expression. A
     floating point number is a number which contains a decimal
     point:

          2.3   12.   .81

     Floating point values in the expression are handled in a
     special way.  With arithmetic and logical operators, if
     either operand is float, the other is converted to float and
     the result of the operation is float.  This means, in
     particular that division of integers results in a
     (truncated) integer, while division of floats results in an
     accurate floating point value.  With functions of type *
     (see table above), the result is float if any argument is
     float, integer otherwise.

     However, GRASS raster map layers can only store integer
     values.  If the final value of the expression is a floating
     point value, this value is rounded to the nearest integer
     before storing it in the result raster map layer.

     Note that raster map layers in the expression are considered
     to be integers.

     The user must be aware of the current geographic region and
     current mask settings when using _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c.  All raster map
     layers are read into the current geographic region masked by
     the current mask.  If it is desired to modify an existing
     raster map layer without involving other raster map layers,
     the geographic region should be set to agree with the cell
     header for the raster map layer.  For example, suppose it is
     determined that the _e_l_e_v_a_t_i_o_n raster map layer must have
     each category value increased by 10 meters.  The following
     expression is legal and will do the job:

          new_elevation = elevation + 10

     Since a category value of 0 is used in GRASS for locations
     which do not exist in the raster map layer, the new raster
     map layer will contain the category value 10 in the
     locations that did not exist in the original elevation.
     Therefore, in this example, it is essential that the
     boundaries of the geographic region be set to agree with the
     cell header.

     However, if there is a current mask, then the resultant
     raster map layer is masked when it is written; i.e., 0
     category values in the mask force zero values in the output.

     Extra care must be taken if the expression is given on the
     command line.  Some characters have special meaning to the
     UNIX shell.  These include, among others:

          * ( ) > & |

     It is advisable to put single quotes around the expression;
     e.g.:

          result = 'elevation * 2'

     Without the quotes, the *, which has special meaning to the
     UNIX shell, would be altered and _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c would see
     something other than the *.

     If the input comes directly from the keyboard and the _r_e_s_u_l_t
     raster map layer exists, the user will be asked if it can be
     overwritten.  Otherwise, the _r_e_s_u_l_t raster map layer will
     automatically be overwritten if it exists.

     Quoting _r_e_s_u_l_t is not allowed.  However, it is never
     necessary to quote _r_e_s_u_l_t since it is always taken to be a
     raster map layer name.

     the map title will contain only some of it, but most (if not
     all) of the formula will be placed into the history file for
     the _r_e_s_u_l_t map.

     When the user enters input to _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c non-interactively on
     the command line, the program will not warn the user not to
     overwrite existing map layers.  Users should therefore take
     care to assign program outputs raster file names that do not
     yet exist in their current mapsets.

     Continuation lines must end with a  and have NO trailing
     white space (blanks or tabs).  If the user does leave white
     space at the end of continuation lines, the error messages
     produced by _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c will be meaningless and the equation
     will not work as the user intended.

     Error messages produced by _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c are almost useless.  In
     future, _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c should make some attempt to point the user
     to the offending section of the equation, e.g.:

          x = a * b ++ c

     ERROR: somewhere in line 1: ...  b ++ c ...


     Currently, there is no comment mechanism in _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c.
     Perhaps adding a capability that would cause the entire line
     to be ignored when the user inserted a # at the start of a
     line as if it were not present, would do the trick.

     The function should require the user to type "end" or "exit"
     instead of simply a blank line.  This would make separation
     of multiple scripts separable by white space.
