DESCRIPTION
     This program reads	a previously selected subset of	STF1 or
     PL94-171 U.S. Census Bureau demographic records (see
     m.in.stf1.tpe and m.in.stf1.db3), and writes one of the
     following:

	 GRASS site list (coordinates and a value).
	 GRASS vector polygon attribute	labels file (coordinates and a label value).
	 Text report to	stdout in one of two formats.

     Any arithmetic expression combining constants with	any of

v.apply.census <main> GRASS Reference Manual<main> v.apply.census



     the more than 900 hundred demographic (numeric) fields can
     be	defined	and will be evaluated (by the Unix bc -l utility)
     to	compute	the value for each input record.

     The location coordinates for the polygon label point or the
     site location is obtained from certain columns (269-287) in
     the input records,	making this program quite specific for
     the specified types of STF1 and PL94-171 input file records.
     Use with other types of input data	is not advised.


SOME PARAMETERS	EXPLAINED BRIEFLY
      out=
	 att	for results to vector map attribute file
	 site	for results to site list
	 -	for results to stdout; this is the default
	 table:	for results in table form to stdout with
		  the column value(s) represented by the ':Lxxx:Lxxx' string
		  preceeding the expression value instead of easting and northing.
		  Lxxx is in same choice of representation as column designation
		  in formula (see below).

      formula=
	 mapname=Computation with STF1A	columns, constants and bc operators
		 (see below).  mapname of vector or site map to	make is	required
		 in all	cases (but ignored for '-' or 'table:' output modes).

      name_field=
	 name is Keyword in stdin stream preceeding the	number of a STF1 record
		 to read from input_stf1 file.	The number is a	physical sequence
		 number, not a record identification number.  This parameter is
		 appropriate only in special uses of this program.  If '-a' is
		 given,	or this	parameter is omitted, all records in STF.file will
		 be processed.


THE formula PARAMETER
     The string	after the '=' in this parameter	almost always
     must be enclosed in quotes	to protect it from Shell
     interpretation of characters such as * / (	 ) and spaces
     (which may	be used	to increase readability, but are not
     necessary).  This string is always	of the form
     mapname=expression.

     The mapname string	can be any legal GRASS map name	(up to 14
     characters).  The second '=' is required and may be
     preceeded and followed by a space.

     In	the expression,	great flexibility is provided for the
     computation of interesting	combinations of	the data fields
     contained in the demographic records.

     The usual operators used in the expression	include: +, -, *,
     /,	and %.	The user should	review the Unix	manual entry for
     the bc calculator for the complete	list of	available
     functions and other operators.

     Parentheses are used in the normal	algebraic manner.

     The operands in the expression may	consist	of any mixture
     of:

	  integer constants
	  real constants
	  functions allowed by bc
	  numeric fields from the demographic records

     Numeric fields from both the IDENTIFICATION and MATRIX
     SECTIONS of the demographic records may be	used.  Review the
     User and Technical	Documentation for these	demographic
     files; or use the -p option of this program to print the
     MATRIX SECTION document (the demographic data fields), or
     m.in.stf1.db3 to print a simplified list of IDENTIFICATION
     SECTION field names.  When	substituting values from the
     numeric fields into the expression, <SPACE> characters are
     replaced by zero.	(Spaces, which are rare	in the
     demographic data, are usually the result of missing values
     or	restricted information).

     The numeric fields	from the demographic records may be
     designated	in one of three	ways in	the expression.

     1.	  'Lcccc', where 'L' is	an upper case alphabetic letter
     which indicates the length	of the numeric field in	the data
     records: A=1, B=2,	... , I=9, J=10, O=15, etc; and	'cccc' is
     the starting column number	for the	data field of interest:
     301 for 100% population count, 7221 for total number of
     four-room housing units, 58 for 101st Congressional
     District, etc. The	proper specification of	the Congressional
     District number would be 'B58' because it is a two-column
     field.  'I301' would indicate that	the 100% poplation should
     be	used in	the calculation; it's a	nine-column field.

     2.	 'Pnna0nnn' or 'Hnna0nnn', where 'n' is	a digit	and 'a'
     is	a digit	or (rarely) upper case letter.	These forms
     represent the MATRIX field	naming schemes used in the CD-ROM
     "dBase 3" files.  They can	be used	in processing STF1
     records extracted from the	CD-ROM or TAPE distribution
     media.  All eight characters of the field name must be used.
     (Note:  this form cannot be used in processing the	PL94-171
     records.)

     3.	 'ID_NAME'.  The STF1 and PL94-171 files use the same set
     of	IDENTIFICATION SECTION field names (67 fields) for the



GRASS 4.3		Baylor University			3






v.apply.census <main> GRASS Reference Manual<main> v.apply.census



     "locational" information contained	in the first 300
     characters	of each	record.	 The field name, in all	upper
     case letters, may be used if the numeric value of the field
     is	needed in the expression.  Two of the most useful fields
     are AREALAND and AREAWAT which allow the direct computation
     of	population density values.

     The bc calculator usually returns a value with a very large
     number of decimal places.	Vector attributes are
     automatically truncated(!)	to integers by the v.support
     program when the topology file is built.  Site list
     descriptions are likewise truncated to integers by	GRASS
     programs which use	the descriptions as numeric values (e.g.,
     sites to cell in s.menu).


THE 'out=table:' PARAMETER
     The default operation of v.apply.census when tabular reports
     are produced to stdout (when not making a sites list or
     vector attribute file) is to print	the easting and	northing
     coordinates and then the value resulting from the
     expression.  Often	the user wishes	to have	an identifier
     different from the	coordinates.  The construction
     out=table:field will replace the coordinates with the
     character string indicated	by field, which	may have any of
     the three forms used for numeric fields in	the formula
     expression, see above.  Note: a special case exists for the
     66	character description field which begins in column 192;
     the entire	field will be printed if designated by either of
     these two forms: out=table:ANPSADPI or out=table:Z192.

     Complex tables may	be produced by making multiple runs of
     v.apply.census, redirecting the tabular output to files, and
     using the Unix tools cut, paste, and colrm	to combine the
     resulting files.


EXAMPLES
     [These examples assume that STF1 records for the census
     tracts (SUMLEV=140) in a particular county	(CNTY=037) have
     been extracted from the distribution source (with
     m.in.stf1.db3 or m.in.stf1.tpe and	saved in a file	named
     037.140 in	the current directory.]

     1.	 Create	a site list where the label values are the
     percentage	of females in each input record:

	v.apply.census in=037.140 out=site formula='pct.female =
     100 * (I373 / I301)'

     2.	 Label an existing vector map (named tract.pop)	of tract
     boundaries	with the total population of each tract	(run

     v.support and build topology after	creating the attributes
     file):

	v.apply.census in=037.140 out=atts
     formula=tract.pop=P0010001	 (or)
	v.apply.census in=037.140 out=atts formula=tract.pop=I301

     3.	 Produce a tabular report of the census	tract numbers and
     the number	of Hispanics per square	kilometer:

	v.apply.census in=037.140 out=table:TRACTBNA
     formula="m=(P0080001/AREALAND)*1000"

     4.	 Produce a tabular report of the number	of people per
     housing unit for each tract and the coordinates of	the
     internal (label) point:

	v.apply.census in=037.140 formula="map=P0010001/H0010001"


FORMAT OF THE FORMULA TEXT FILE
     Running this program with the ef=file command line	parameter
     causes the	named file to be read and each formula contained
     therein to	be processed as	if it were entered on the command
     line.  The	out= parameter may optionally be respecified in
     this file;	each out= selection remains in effect until
     explicitly	changed.  The program exits after the last
     formula is	processed.

     The following is a	sample formula file.  Note the use of
     lines beginning with '#' as manditory formula separators and
     comment lines.  Also note that expressions	may be continued
     on	successive lines; the lines are	concatenated to	a maximum
     of	500 characters for a single formula.  Blank lines are
     ignored.

	  popden.sqkm =	1000 * P0010001	/ (AREALAND+AREAWAT)
	  # that computes population density in	people per sq. km.
	  #
	  # next do people per sq. mile	as a vector attribute file
	  out=att
	  popden.sqmi =	2.59*1000 *
	  P0010001 / (AREALAND+
	  AREAWAT)
	  #
	  # next do total population as	a vector attribute file
	  total.pop = I301
	  #
	  # output the county identification numbers as	the descriptions
	  # in a site list
	  out=sites county = CNTY
	  #

	  # output the 66 char.	description and	FIPS Place Code	as a table
	  out=table:ANPSADPI
	  map=PLACEFP
	  # optional ending comment line


BUGS/FEATURES
     Computational errors in bc	are not	handled	too gracefully:	a
     warning is	output and a zero result is used.

     bc	tends to output	lots of	decimal	places.	 The user must
     clean this	up for output sent to stdout.

     The GRASS site list output	format used includes the '#'
     before the	label value to facilitate the production of
     raster maps with cell values representing the results of the
     formula execution.

     If	using the "name_field" and "ef"	parameters, the	formula
     file may contain only one formula.


SEE ALSO
     m.in.stf1.tpe is used as a	preprocessor to	select subsets of
     STF1 or PL-171 tape format	records	for input to this
     program.  m.in.stf1.db3 is	used as	a preprocessor to select
     subsets of	STF1 records from the CD-ROM in	"dBase 3" format.
     Unix utility programs such	at grep	or awk can also	be used
     to	select subsets of lines	from the PL94-171 files, but not
     from the STF1 tape	files due to their very	long record
     lengths.
