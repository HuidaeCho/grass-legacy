NAME
     s.surf.idw - Surface generation from sites data program.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     s.surf.idw input=name output=name [npoints=count]

DESCRIPTION
     s.surf.idw fills a raster matrix with interpolated values
     generated from a set of irregularly spaced data points using
     numerical approximation (weighted averaging) techniques.
     The interpolated value of a cell is determined by values of
     nearby data points and the distance of the cell from those
     input points.  In comparison with other methods, numerical
     approximation allows representation of more complex surfaces
     (particularly those with anomalous features), restricts the
     spatial influence of any errors, and generates the
     interpolated surface from the data points.  It is the most
     appropriate method to apply to most spatial data.

     This program allows the user to use a GRASS site list file,
     rather than a raster map layer, as input.

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies the values of needed program parameters and any
     desired optional parameter values on the command line, using
     the form:

          s.surf.idw input=name output=name [npoints=count]

     Alternately, the user can simply type s.surf.idw on the
     command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for needed inputs and option choices
     using the standard GRASS parser interface described in the
     manual entry for parser.


     Parameters:

     input=name        Name of an input site list file that
                       contains a set of irregularly spaced data
                       values; i.e., some cells contain known
                       data values while the rest contain zero
                       (0).

     output=name       Name to be assigned to the new output
                       raster map layer containing a smooth
                       surface generated from the known data
                       values in the input site list file.

     npoints=count     The number of points to use for
                       interpolation.  By default, the 12 nearest

                       points are used for interpolation.
                       Default:  12

NOTES
     The amount of memory used by this program is related to the
     number of non-zero data values in the input sites list file.
     If the input site list is very dense (i.e., contains many
     non-zero data points), the program may not be able to get
     all the memory it needs from the system.  The time required
     to execute increases with the number of input data points.

     If the user has a mask set, then interpolation is only done
     for those cells that fall within the mask.  However, all
     non-zero data points in the input map are used even if they
     fall outside the mask.
