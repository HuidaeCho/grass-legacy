NAME
     r.water.outlet - Watershed basin creation program.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.water.outlet
     r.water.outlet help
     r.water.outlet drainage=name basin=name easting=value
          northing=value

DESCRIPTION
     r.water.outlet generates a watershed basin from a drainage
     direction map (from r.watershed or r.water.aspect) and a set
     of coordinates representing the outlet point of watershed.

OPTIONS
     drainage
          Input map: drainage direction.  Indicates the "aspect"
          for each cell.  Multiplying positive values by 45 will
          give the direction in degrees that the surface runoff
          will travel from that cell.  The value -1 indicates
          that the cell is a depression area.  Other negative
          values indicate that surface runoff is leaving the
          boundaries of the current geographic region.  The
          absolute value of these negative cells indicates the
          direction of flow.  This map is generated from either
          r.watershed or r.water.aspect.

     basin
          Output map: Values of one (1) indicate the watershed
          basin.  Values of zero are not in the watershed basin.

     easting
          Input value: Easting value of outlet point.

     northing
          Input value: Northing value of outlet point.

NOTES
     In the context of this program, a watershed basin is the
     region upstream of an outlet point.  Thus, if the user
     chooses an outlet point on a hill slope, the resulting map
     will be a thin silver of land representing the overland
     slope uphill of the point.

     It is usually a good idea for the user to "find" the stream
     channel of the desired basin.  If the user runs
     r.water.accum, r.water.swale with a small swale threshold,
     and d.where on the resulting map, the user can pinpoint the
     exact location of the outlet point with ease.
