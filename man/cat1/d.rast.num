NAME
     d.rast.num	- Overlays cell	category values	on a raster map
     layer displayed to	the graphics monitor.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.rast.num
     d.rast.num	help
     d.rast.num	[map=name] [grid_color=name]

DESCRIPTION
     d.rast.num	overlays cell category values onto a raster map
     layer displayed to	the user's graphics monitor.  Category
     values will be displayed in white and/or black, based on the
     colors in which underlying	cells are displayed.  A	grid
     outlining each map	cell will also be overlain in a	user-
     specified color.

     The user should run d.rast	to display the desired map layer
     on	the graphics monitor before running this program.

     d.rast.num	can be run non-interactively or	interactively.
     If	the user specifies the map whose category values are to
     be	displayed and/or the grid color	on the command line, the
     program will run non-interactively.  Alternately, the user
     may simply	type d.rast.num	on the command line; in	this
     case, the program will prompt the user for	parameter values
     using the standard	GRASS user interface described in the
     manual entry for parser.  If no grid color	is given the
     default will be used.  If no map layer is specified, the
     program will use whatever raster map layer	is currently
     displayed in the active frame on the graphics monitor.

COMMAND	LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     map=name	       Name of existing	raster map layer whose
		       category	values will be displayed.
		       Default:	 (whatever raster map layer is
		       currently displayed)

     grid_color=name   Color in	which an overlain grid will be
		       displayed.
		       Options:	 white,	red, orange, yellow,
		       green, blue, indigo, violet, magenta,
		       brown, gray, black
		       Default:	 gray

NOTES
     The user is advised to set	the current region to a
     relatively	small area (i.e., less than 100	rows by	100
     columns); otherwise, the individual cells being displayed
