NAME
     v.mkquads - Creates a GRASS vector map layer and/or sites
     list and/or geographic region definition file for a USGS
     7.5-minute quadrangle.
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.mkquads
     v.mkquads help
     v.mkquads [-esrvx] map=name

DESCRIPTION
     There are three types of output available from the GRASS
     program v.mkquads :

     (1)  a vector map of all the full USGS quadrangles that will
	  fit within the boundaries of the current geographic
	  region.

     (2)  a GRASS sites list containing the corner coordinates of
	  each of these quads.

     (3)  GRASS geographic region definition files associated
	  with each of the quads created.

     A quad is defined as the area covered by a USGS 7.5-minute
     (1:24,000) map.  This program is useful for managing a GRASS
     data base LOCATION which contains a number of quads which
     are to be patched together.

     Flags:

     -e		  Encompass current geographic region with quads
		  (rather than only creating those quads that lie
		  inside of the geographic region).  Use of this
		  option will affect all output options.

     -s		  Create a GRASS sites list file.  The sites list
		  will contain all the corner coordinates of all
		  the full quads that can be built in the current
		  geographic region.  The sites list file can
		  then be displayed using the d.sites program.

     -r		  Create region file(s): quad.1 quad.2 ...  The
		  program will generate a separate geographic
		  region definition file for each quad;	 each of
		  the geographic region files created will have
		  the prefix quad. with some number attached to
		  it.  For example, if only one quad were
		  created, the geographic region file quad.1
		  would also be created in the windows directory
		  under the user's current mapset.  To make the

		  program-generated geographic region definition
		  file quad.1 your current geographic region
		  setting, run the GRASS g.region program.

     -v		  Create vector file (default).	 Only full quads
		  will be created.  The binary vector map layer
		  output is placed under the user's dig directory
		  and can be used like any other vector map
		  layer.  Run v.support to build the topology
		  information for the vector map before using
		  v.mkquads map layer outputs in the v.digit
		  program.  Since the quads are computer-
		  generated, the corner coordinates will be
		  exact.  This simplifies digitizing if one or
		  more quad sheets will have to be brought
		  together for a data base, because all of the
		  quad corner points to be joined will be
		  guaranteed to match.

     -x		  Create a GRASS registration (reg) file.


     Parameter:

     map=name	  The name of a file to contain program output.

     If the user runs v.mkquads without including program
     parameter value and desired flags on the command line, the
     program will prompt the user for the above information using
     the standard GRASS interface described in the manual entry
     for parser.

NOTES
     All output options can be used on the command line at the
     same time.	 A listing of all the quad points in
     latitude/longitude and UTM coordinates will be displayed
     each time the program is executed.	 The spheroid being used
     for the lat/lon to UTM conversions is clark66.

BUGS
     Currently, this program only works for GRASS locations in a
     Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system (in
     meters).  There are no guarantees that v.mkquads will
     function properly if a quadrangle crosses UTM zones.  This
     program has not been tested outside the northwest UTM
     quadrant.
