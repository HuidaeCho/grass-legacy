NAME
     r.out.ascii - Converts a raster map layer into an ASCII text
     file.
     (GRASS Raster Data Export Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.out.ascii
     r.out.ascii help
     r.out.ascii [-h] map=name [digits=value]

DESCRIPTION
     r.out.ascii converts a user-specified raster map layer
     (map=name) into an ASCII text file suitable for export to
     other computer systems.  The digits=value option (where
     value is a number of the user's choice) can be used to
     request that numbers in the ouput be equally-spaced (i.e.,
     columnar output).  Each category value in the ASCII map
     layer will then take up value number of spaces.  However, to
     use this, the user should know the maximum number of digits
     that will occur in the output file, and add one to this
     number (to leave a space between each column).  The user can
     find the maximum number of digits occurring in the output
     file by running r.out.ascii without the digits=value option.

     The GRASS program r.in.ascii can be used to perform the
     reverse function, converting an ASCII file in suitable
     format to GRASS raster file format.

     Flag:

     -h                Suppress printing of header information.

                       Parameters:

     map=name          Name of an existing raster map layer.

     digits=value      The minimum number of digits (per cell) to
                       be printed.

     r.out.ascii can be run either non-interactively or
     interactively.  The program will be run non-interactively if
     the user specifies the name of a raster map layer and
     (optionally) a value for digits, using the form

          r.out.ascii map=name [digits=value]

     where name is the name of a raster map layer to be converted
     to ASCII format, and value is the minimum number of digits
     (per cell) to be printed to output.  The user can also the
     -h option to suppress the output of file header information.

     Alternately, the user can simply type r.out.ascii on the
     command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for parameter values using the
     standard GRASS parser interface described in the manual
     entry for parser.

NOTES
     The output from r.out.ascii may be placed into a file by
     using the UNIX redirection mechanism;  e.g.:

          r.out.ascii map=soils > out.file

     The output file out.file can then be printed or copied onto
     a magnetic tape or floppy disk for export purposes.
