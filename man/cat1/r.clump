NAME
     r.clump - Recategorizes data in a raster map layer by
     grouping cells that form physically discrete areas into
     unique categories.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.clump
     r.clump help
     r.clump [-q] input=name output=name [title="string"]

DESCRIPTION
     r.clump finds all areas of contiguous cell category values
     in the input raster map layer name.  It assigns a unique
     category value to each such area ("clump") in the resulting
     output raster map layer name.  If the user does not provide
     input and output map layer names on the command line, the
     program will prompt the user for these names, using the
     standard parser interface (see manual entry for parser).

     Category distinctions in the input raster map layer are
     preserved.	 This means that if distinct category values are
     adjacent, they will NOT be clumped together.  (The user can
     run r.reclass prior to r.clump to recategorize cells and
     reassign cell category values.)

     Flag:

     -q		       Run quietly, without printing messages on
		       program progress to standard output.


     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of an existing raster map layer being
		       used for input.

     output=name       Name of new raster map layer to contain
		       program output.

     title="string"    Optional title for output raster map
		       layer, in quotes.  If the user fails to
		       assign a title for the output map layer,
		       none will be assigned it.

ALGORITHM
     r.clump moves a 2x2 matrix over the input raster map layer.
     The lower right-hand corner of the matrix is grouped with
     the cells above it, or to the left of it.	(Diagonal cells
     are not considered.)

NOTES
     r.clump works properly with raster map layers that contain
     only "fat" areas (more than a single cell in width).  Linear
     elements (lines that are a single cell wide) may or may not
     be clumped together depending on the direction of the line
     -- horizontal and vertical lines of cells are considered to
     be contiguous, but diagonal lines of cells are not
     considered to be contiguous and are broken up into separate
     clumps.

     A random color table and other support files are generated
     for the output raster map layer.
