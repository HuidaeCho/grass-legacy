NAME
     r.spreadpath - Recursively	traces the least cost path
     backwards to cells	from which the cumulative cost was
     determined. (GRASS	Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.spreadpath
     r.spreadpath help
     r.spreadpath [-v] x_input=name y_output=name
     [coordinate=x,y[x,y,...]] output=name

DESCRIPTION
     r.spreadpath recursively traces the least cost path
     backwards to the origin, given backlink information input
     map layers	and target locations from where	paths are to be
     traced. The backlink information map layers record	each
     cell's backlink UTM northing (the y_input)	and easting (the
     x_input) coordinates from which the cell's	cumulative cost
     was determined.

     The backlink inputs can be	generated from another GRASS
     raster program r.spread. One of the major applications of
     r.spreadpath along	with r.spread is to accurately find the
     least cost	corridors and/or paths on a raster setting. More
     information on r.spread and r.spreadpath can be found in Xu
     (1994).

     Flags:

     -v		       Run verbosely.

     Parameters:

     x_input=name      Name of input raster map	layer containing
		       backlink	UTM easting coordinates.

     y_input=name      Name of input raster map	layer containing
		       backlink	UTM northing coordinates.

     coordinate=x,y[,x,y,x,y, ...]
		       Each x,y	coordinate pair	gives the easting
		       and northing (respectively) geographic
		       coordinates of a	target point from which
		       to backwards trace the least cost path. As
		       many points as desired can be entered by
		       the user.

     output=name       Name of raster map layer	to contain
		       output.	Also can be used as the	map layer
		       of the input target points.  If so used,
		       the input target	point map will be
		       overwritten by the output.

OPTIONS
     The user can run r.spread either interactively or non-
     interactively.  The program is run	interactively if the user
     types r.spreadpath	without	specifying flag	setting	and
     parameter values on the command line.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for input.

     Alternately, the user can run r.spreadpath	non-
     interactively, by specifying the names of raster map layers
     and desired options on the	command	line, using the	form:

	  r.spreadpath [-v] x_input=name y_output=name
	  [coordinate=x,y[x,y,...]] output=name
