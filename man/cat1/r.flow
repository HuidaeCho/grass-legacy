NAME
     r.flow - construction of slope curves (flowlines),	flowpath
     lengths, and flowline densities from a raster DEM
     (GRASS Raster/Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.flow
     r.flow elevin=name	[ aspin=name ] [ barin=name ]
	  [ -u3mMq ] [ skip=val	] [ bound=val ]
	  [ flout=name ] [ lgout=name ]	[ dsout=name ]


DESCRIPTION
     r.flow generates flowlines	using a	combined raster-vector
     approach from an input elevation raster map elevin, and
     optionally	an input aspect	raster map aspin and/or	an input
     barrier raster map	barin.	There are three	possible output
     maps which	can be produced	in any combination
     simultaneously:  a	vector file flout of flowlines,	a raster
     map lgout of flowpath lengths, and	a raster map dsout of
     flowline densities.

     Aspect used for input must	follow the same	rules as aspect
     computed in other GRASS4.1	programs (see r.slope.aspect,
     s.surf.tps).

     Flowline output is	given in a vector map flout.  The line
     segments of flowline vectors have endpoints on a grid formed
     by	drawing	imaginary lines	through	the centers of the cells
     in	the elevation map.  Flowlines are generated from each
     cell downhill by default; they can	be generated uphill using
     the flag -u.  A flowline stops if its next	segment	would
     reverse the direction of flow (from up to down or vice-
     versa), cross a barrier, or arrive	at a cell with undefined
     elevation or aspect.  Another option, skip=val, indicates
     that only the flowlines from every	valth cell are to be
     included in flout.	 The default skip is max(1, <rows in
     elevin>/50, <cols in elevin>/50).	A high skip usually
     speeds up processing time and often improves the readability
     of	a visualization	of flout.


     Flowpath length output is given in	a raster map lgout.  The
     value in each grid	cell is	the sum	of the planar lengths of
     all segments of the flowline generated from that cell.  If
     the flag -z is given, elevation is	taken into account in
     calculating the length of each segment.


     Flowline density output is	given in a raster map dsout.  The
     value in each grid	cell is	the number of flowlines	in the
     entire map	which have segment endpoints within that cell.

OPTIONS
     If	the user specifies program arguments and flag settings on
     the command line, the program will	immediately begin
     working.  Alternatively, the user can simply type r.flow on
     the command line and the program will ask for parameter
     values and	flag settings interactively, using the standard
     GRASS parser interface.


     Flags:

     -u		       Generate	flowlines uphill (default
		       generates flowlines downhill).


     -3		       Compute three-dimensional lengths (default
		       is two-dimensional).


     -m		       Use less	memory and compute aspect at each
		       cell on the fly.	 This option incurs a
		       performance penalty.  If	this flag is
		       given, the aspect input map (if any) will
		       be ignored.


     -M		       Use a fixed size	memory and utilize page-
		       swapping	to handle large	input files.
		       This option incurs a severe performance
		       penalty but is the only way to handle
		       arbitrarily-large data files.  If this
		       flag is given, the -m flag will be
		       ignored.


     -q		       Quiet operation.	 Do not	print diagnostic
		       messages	indicating progress.


     Parameters:


     elevin=name       Use the existing	raster file name with
		       elevations as input (required).


     aspin=name	       Use the existing	raster file name with
		       aspects as input.


     barin=name	       Use the existing	raster file name with
		       non-zero	values representing barriers as

		       input.


     skip=val	       Set the number of cells between flowlines
		       in the flout output map to val.


     bound=val	       Set the maximum number of segments of each
		       flowline	to val (default	is the maximum
		       possible).


     flout=name	       Output coordinates of flowlines to a
		       vector file named name.


     lgout=name	       Output flowpath length values to	a raster
		       file named name.


     dsout=name	       Output flowline density values to a raster
		       file named name.


NOTES
     For best results, use input elevation maps	with high
     precision units (e.g., centimeters) so that flowlines do not
     terminate prematurely in flat areas.

     To	prevent	the creation of	tiny flowline segments with
     imperceivable changes in elevation, an endpoint which would
     land very close to	the center of a	grid cell is quantized to
     the exact center of that cell.  The maximum distance between
     the intercepts along each axis of a single	diagonal segment
     and another segment of 1/2	degree different aspect	is taken
     to	be "very close"	for that axis.	Note that this distance
     (the so-called "quantization error") is about 1-2%	of the
     resolution	on maps	with square cells.

     The values	in length maps computed	using the -u flag
     represent the distances from each cell to an upland flat or
     singular point.  Such distances are useful	in water erosion
     modeling for computation of the LS	factor in the standard
     form of USLE.  Uphill flowlines tend to merge on ridge
     lines; by redirecting the order of	the flowline points in
     the output	vector map, dispersed waterflow	can be simulated.
     The density map can be used for the extraction of ridge
     lines.

     Computing the flowlines downhill simulates	the actual flow
     (also known as the	raindrop method).  These flowlines tend
     to	merge in valleys; they can be used for localization of

     areas with	waterflow accumulation and for the extraction of
     valley lines.  The	downslope flowline density multiplied by
     the resolution is equal to	the upslope contributing area,
     defined as	the area from which water flows	into a given
     cell.  This area is a measure of potential	water flux and
     can be used in the	modeling of water erosion for the
     computation of the	unit stream power based	LS factor.

     The program has been designed for modeling	erosion	on
     hillslopes	and has	rather strict conditions for ending
     flowlines.	 It is therefore not very suitable for the
     extraction	of stream networks or delineation of watersheds
     unless a DEM without pits or flat areas is	available.

     If	r.flow is invoked with the -M flag, it will create up to
     three segment files; concurrently running copies of r.flow
     using this	flag will compete for the same three files.
     Until concurrency control is standardized in GRASS	it is
     suggested that all	concurrently running copies of r.flow
     using the -M flag have distinct input and output files.

	  [dsout=name]
	  Invalid options were specified on the	command	line.

     ERROR: r.flow: cannot get header for filename
     ERROR: r.flow: cannot create raster|vector	map filename

	  Self-explanatory or beyond explanation.

     ERROR: r.flow: input file's resolution differs from current
	  region resolution
	  The resolutions of all input files and the current
	  region must match.  In future	versions this error will
	  be demoted to	a warning.

     ERROR: r.flow: resolution too unbalanced (val x val)
	  The difference in length between the two axes	of a grid
	  cell is so great that	quantization error is larger than
	  one of the dimensions.  Resample the map and try again.
