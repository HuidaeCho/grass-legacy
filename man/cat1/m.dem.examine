NAME
     m.dem.examine - Provides a terse description of USGS Digital
     Elevation Model (DEM) data files stored on 1/2-inch magnetic
     tape.
     (GRASS Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.dem.examine input=name blocksize=value

DESCRIPTION
     m.dem.examine reads Digital Elevation Model (DEM) terrain
     elevation data produced and supplied by the USGS from the
     input file specified by name, in the block size specified by
     value.  If no input file is named on the command line, the
     program assumes that /dev/rmt0 is the input file.  The
     information provided to the user comes from each file
     included on tape.  Included are the maximum and minimum
     elevation values and the approximate UTM boundaries of each
     file.  The program assumes unlabeled tapes in ASCII format
     with no header or trailer files.
