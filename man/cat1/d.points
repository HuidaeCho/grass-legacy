NAME
     d.points - Displays point graphics in the active frame on
     the graphics display monitor.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.points
     d.points help
     d.points [color=name] [size=value] [type=name] [file=name]

DESCRIPTION
     d.points displays points whose coordinate locations are
     specified by the user and located within the current
     geographic region in the active display frame on the
     graphics monitor.  Point coordinates are read either from
     standard input or from a file stated by the file=name
     option.  When entering coordinates through standard input,
     the user presses control-d to signal the end of input to
     d.points.

     The program can be run interactively or non-interactively.
     The user can run the program completely non-interactively by
     specifying the name of a points file (containing the
     geographic coordinates of icons to be sited) and the values
     of all needed parameters on the command line.  If the name
     of an input file to d.points is given on the command line,
     any other parameter values left unspecified on the command
     line (e.g., the icon color, size, and/or type) are set to
     their default values.

     The user can instead elect to run the program partially
     interactively, by specifying any/all of the parameters
     except the points file=name parameter on the command line.
     In this case, d.points will expect the user to enter icon
     locations from standard input (i.e., at the keyboard) and
     will (silently) prompt the user for these locations.  Each
     icon location should be entered as an easting and northing
     pair separated by a space, followed by a carriage return.
     Coordinates should be stated in whatever map coordinate
     system is used by the user's current GRASS location.  The
     user presses control-d to signal the end of standard input
     to d.points.

     Alternately, the user can simply type d.points on the
     command line, and be prompted for the values of all
     parameters (the user can still input icon coordinates from
     an input file using this form).  In this case, the user is
     presented with the standard GRASS parser interface described
     in the manual entry for parser.

     color=name   Sets the current color to the name stated.
                  Options:  red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
                  indigo, violet, gray, white, and black
                  Default:  gray

     size=value   Size of icon in pixels.
                  Options:  0-1000  (pixels)
                  Default:  5  (pixels)

     type=name    Sets the shape (type) of the icon to be drawn
                  to name.
                  Options:  x, diamond, box, +
                  Default:  +

     file=name    Take input from the UNIX file name.  (Note:
                  This file must be in the user's current
                  directory or given by its full path name.)
                  Default:  Standard input.
                  The file contents should consist of a series of
                  geographic coordinates that fit within the
                  boundaries of the current geographic region
                  falling within the active display frame (refer
                  to d.where or g.region for these coordinates).
                  Each icon location should be specified by an
                  easting and northing (in that order) separated
                  by a single blank space, and followed by a
                  carriage return.  Eastings and northings should
                  be stated in whatever map coordinate system is
                  being used by the user's current GRASS
                  location.

NOTES
     d.points will display a point at the location specified in
     the active frame, even if the point lies outside the
     boundaries of current geographic region.
