NAME
     r.mask - Establishes or removes the current working mask.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.mask

DESCRIPTION
     The r.mask program allows the user to block out certain
     areas of a map from analysis, by "hiding" them from sight of
     other GRASS programs.  This is done by establishing a mask.
     While a mask exists, most GRASS programs will operate only
     on data falling inside the masked area, and ignore any data
     falling outside of the mask.

     Because the mask is actually only a reclass file called
     "MASK" that is created when the user identifies a mask using
     r.mask, it can be copied, renamed, removed, and used in
     analyses, just like other GRASS raster map layers.  The user
     should be aware that a mask remains in place until a user
     renames it to something other than "MASK", or removes it
     using r.mask or g.remove.

     r.mask provides the following options:

            1     Remove the current mask
            2     Identify a new mask
          RETURN  Exit from program

     The user establishes a new mask by choosing option (2).  The
     user will be asked to name an existing raster map layer from
     among those available in the current mapset search path.
     Once done, the user is shown a listing of this map's
     categories, and is asked to assign a value of "1" or "0" to
     each map category.  Areas assigned category value "1" will
     become part of the mask's surface, while areas assigned
     category value "0" will become "no data" areas in the MASK
     file.

     If a category is not assigned category value "1" it will
     automatically be assigned the category value "0" in the
     resulting MASK file.  Any cells falling in category "0" will
     fall outside the newly formed mask, and their presence will
     be ignored by GRASS programs run later on, as long as the
     MASK file remains in place.

NOTES
     The above method for specifying a "mask" may seem
     counterintuitive.  Areas inside the mask are not hidden;
     areas outside the mask will be ignored until the MASK file
     is removed.

     This program actually creates a raster map layer (reclass
     type) called MASK,  which can be manipulated (renamed,
     removed, copied, etc.) like any other raster map layer.

     Somewhat similar program functions to those performed by
     r.mask can be done using r.mapcalc, g.region, and other
     programs.

     This program can only be run interactively.
