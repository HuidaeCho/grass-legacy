NAME
     v.out.ascii - Converts a binary GRASS vector map layer into
     an ASCII GRASS vector map layer.
     (GRASS Vector Data Export Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.out.ascii
     v.out.ascii help
     v.out.ascii input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     v.out.ascii converts a GRASS vector map in binary format to
     a GRASS vector map in ASCII format.

     The program can be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies all needed program arguments on the command line,
     in the form

	  v.out.ascii input=name output=name

     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of the binary GRASS vector input file
		       to be converted to ASCII format.

     output=name       Name of the ASCII GRASS vector output
		       file.

     If the user runs v.out.ascii without giving the names of an
     input and output file on the command line, the program will
     prompt the user for these names.

NOTES
     The GRASS program v.in.ascii performs the function of
     v.out.ascii in reverse;  i.e., it converts vector files in
     ASCII format to their binary format.  These two companion
     programs are useful both for importing and exporting vector
     files between GRASS and other software, and for transferring
     data between machines.

     The output from v.out.ascii will be placed in the user's
     current mapset under the $LOCATION/dig_ascii directory.

     v.out.ascii does not copy the dig_cats file associated with
     the binary vector input map to the new output file name.
     The user must copy the dig_cats file to the new output name
     if this is desired (e.g., using the UNIX cp command).
