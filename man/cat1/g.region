NAME
     g.region - Program to manage the boundary definitions for
     the geographic region.
     (GRASS Region Management Program)

SYNOPSIS
     g.region
     g.region help
     g.region [-dgpu] [region=name] [raster=name] [vector=name]
	[sites=name] [3dview=name] [n=value] [s=value] [e=value]
	[w=value] [res=value] [nsres=value] [ewres=value]
	[zoom=name] [align=name] [save=name]

DESCRIPTION
     The g.region program allows the user to manage the settings
     of the current geographic region.	These regional boundaries
     can be set by the user directly and/or set from a region
     definition file (stored under the windows directory in the
     user's current mapset).  The user can create, modify, and
     store as many geographic region definitions as desired for
     any given mapset.	However, only one of these geographic
     region definitions will be current at any given moment, for
     a specified mapset;  i.e., GRASS programs that respect the
     geographic region settings will use the current geographic
     region settings.

INTERACTIVE PROGRAM USE: MAIN MENU
     The main menu consists of an information section listing the
     current GRASS data base LOCATION, MAPSET, and CURRENT
     REGION, followed by user options:

DEFINITIONS
     Region:
	  Here, a region refers to a geographic area with some
	  defined boundaries, based on a specific map coordinate
	  system and map projection.  Each region also has
	  associated with it the specific east-west and north-
	  south resolutions of its smallest units (rectangular
	  units called "cells").

	  The region's boundaries are given as the northernmost,
	  southernmost, easternmost, and westernmost points that
	  define its extent.  The north and south boundaries are
	  commonly called northings, while the east and west
	  boundaries are called eastings.

	  The region's cell resolution defines the size of the
	  smallest piece of data recognized (imported, analyzed,
	  displayed, stored, etc.) by GRASS programs affected by
	  the current region settings.	The north-south and east-
	  west cell resolutions need not be the same, thus
	  allowing non-square data cells to exist.

     Default Region:

g.region <main>	      GRASS Reference Manual	  <main> g.region



	  Each GRASS LOCATION_NAME has a fixed geographic region,
	  called the default geographic region (stored in the
	  region file DEFAULT_WIND under the special mapset
	  PERMANENT), that defines the extent of the data base.
	  While this provides a starting point for defining new
	  geographic regions, user-defined geographic regions
	  need not fall within this geographic region.

     Current Region:
	  Each mapset has a current geographic region.	This
	  region defines the geographic area in which all GRASS
	  displays and analyses will be done.  Data will be
	  resampled, if necessary, to meet the cell resolutions
	  of the current geographic region setting.

     Region Data Base:
	  Each GRASS MAPSET may contain any number of pre-
	  defined, and named, geographic regions.  These region
	  definitions are stored in the user's current mapset
	  location under the windows directory (also referred to
	  as the user's data base of region definitions).  Any of
	  these pre-defined geographic regions may be selected,
	  by name, to become the current geographic region.
	  Users may also access saved region definitions stored
	  under other mapsets in the current location, if these
	  mapsets are included in the user's mapset search path.

REGION EDIT PROMPT
     Most of the options will require the user to edit a
     geographic region, be it the current geographic region or
     one stored in the user's data base of region definitions
     (the windows directory).  A standard prompt is used to
     perform this edit.	 An example is shown below:

     The fields NORTH EDGE, SOUTH EDGE, WEST EDGE and EAST EDGE,
     are the boundaries of the geographic region that the user
     can change.  The fields Default North, Default South, Def
     West and Def East are the boundaries of the default
     geographic region that are displayed for reference and
     cannot be changed.	 The two GRID RESOLUTION Region fields
     (east-west, and north-south) are the geographic region's
     cell resolutions that the user can change.	 The two GRID
     RESOLUTION Default fields list the resolutions of the
     default geographic region;	 these are displayed for
     reference and cannot be changed here by the user.

REGION MANAGEMENT MENU OPTIONS
     1 Modify the current geographic region directly
	  Allows the user to edit the current region.

     2 Set current geographic region from default region
	  Copies the default region to the current geographic
	  region, and then lets the user edit the current
	  geographic region.

region
     3 Set current geographic region from a data base geographic
	  Allows the user to select a geographic region by name
	  from the data base of geographic regions to become the

g.region <main>	      GRASS Reference Manual	  <main> g.region



	  current geographic region, and then lets the user edit
	  the current geographic region.

	  Note:	 geographic region definition files may be
	  selected from other mapsets as well, if accessible and
	  in the user's mapset search path.

     4 Set current geographic region from a raster (cell) map
	  layer
	  Allows the user to select a raster map layer, copies
	  the cell header for this map layer to the current
	  geographic region, and then lets the user edit the
	  current geographic region.  This option is useful when
	  subsequent GRASS operations will be used to produce a
	  raster map layer from one input raster map layer and it
	  is necessary that the result coincide with the input
	  raster map layer.

     5 Save the current geographic region (window) in the data
	  base
	  Allows the user to save the current geographic region
	  settings in the user's data base of such settings.
	  These files are stored in the windows directory under
	  the user's current mapset.  This option is useful when
	  the current geographic region is set directly using
	  option 2, or even by another GRASS program (e.g.,
	  d.display).  This option installs an otherwise
	  temporary geographic region setting into the geographic
	  region definition data base for recall when needed.

     6 Create a new data base geographic region setting
	  Creates a new geographic region definition in the
	  user's data base of such settings in the windows
	  directory under the current mapset, using the
	  geographic region edit prompt described above.  After
	  the geographic region definition is created, the user
	  is asked if this geographic region setting should also
	  be used as the current geographic region.

     7 Modify a data base geographic region setting
	  Modifies a geographic region setting (in the data base
	  of such settings in the windows directory of the
	  current mapset), using the geographic region edit
	  prompt.  After the changes have been made, the user is
	  asked if this geographic region setting should also be
	  used as the current geographic region.

NON-INTERACTIVE PROGRAM USE
     Alternately, the user can modify the settings of the current
     geographic region by specifying all needed parameters on the
     command line.  The user enters the command	 g.region parms,
     where parms are the following parameters and/or flags:



GRASS 5.0beta6	      GRASS Development Team			5






g.region <main>	      GRASS Reference Manual	  <main> g.region



     Flags:

     -d		       Set current region settings equal to
		       default region settings.

     -g		       Print the current region settings (shell
		       script style) in a format that can be
		       given back to g.region on its command
		       line.

     -p		       Print the current region settings.

     -u		       Do not update the current region file
		       settings.  Allows the user to temporarily
		       use a different region setting, without
		       saving this setting.

     Parameters:

     region=name       Make current region settings same as the
		       named region file settings

     raster=name       Make current region settings same as those
		       in the named raster map's cell header.
		       But see zoom=name option, below.

     vector=name       Make the current region settings the same
		       as those of the named vector map.

     sites=name	       Set the current region to the smallest
		       region encompassing all coordinates in the
		       named site_lists file, aligned with the
		       current region.

     3dview=name       Make current region settings same as those
		       in the named 3dview file, which holds the
		       region that was current when the 3dview
		       was saved.

     n=value	       Set map coordinate value for the region's
		       northern edge to x

     s=value	       Set map coordinate value for the region's
		       southern edge to x

     e=value	       Set map coordinate value for the region's
		       eastern edge to x

     w=value	       Set map coordinate value for the region's
		       western edge to x

     res=value	       Set grid resolution (both north-south and



6		      GRASS Development Team	   GRASS 5.0beta6






g.region <main>	      GRASS Reference Manual	  <main> g.region



		       east-west) to x

     nsres=value       Set north-south grid resolution value to x

     ewres=value       Set east-west grid resolution value to x

     zoom=name	       Set current region settings to the
		       smallest region encompassing all non-zero
		       data in the named raster map layer that
		       fall inside the user's current region.
		       If the user also includes the raster=name
		       option on the command line, zoom=name will
		       set the current region settings to the
		       smallest region encompassing all non-zero
		       data in the named zoom map that fall
		       inside the region stated in the cell
		       header for the named raster map.

     align=name	       Set the current resolution equal to that
		       of the named raster map, and align the
		       current region to a row and column edge in
		       the named map.  Alignment only moves the
		       existing region edges outward to the edges
		       of the next nearest cell in the named
		       raster map -- not to the named map's
		       edges.  To perform the latter function,
		       use the raster=name option.

     save=name	       Save current region settings in the named
		       region file

EXAMPLES
     g.region n=7360100 e=699000
	  will reset the northing and easting for the current
	  region, but leave the south edge, west edge, and the
	  region cell resolutions unchanged.

     g.region -dp s=698000
	  will set the current region from the default region for
	  the GRASS data base location, reset the south edge to
	  698000, and then print the result.

     g.region n=n+1000 w=w500
	  The n=value may also be specified as a function of its
	  current value:  n=n+value increases the current
	  northing, while n=nvalue decreases it.  This is also
	  true for s=value, e=value, and w=value.  In this
	  example the current region's northern boundary is
	  extended by 1000 units and the current region's western
	  boundary is decreased by 500 units.

     g.region n=s+1000 e=w+1000

g.region <main>	      GRASS Reference Manual	  <main> g.region



	  This form allows the user to set the region boundary
	  values relative to one another.  Here, the northern
	  boundary coordinate is set equal to 1000 units larger
	  than the southern boundary's coordinate value, and the
	  eastern boundary's coordinate value is set equal to
	  1000 units larger than the western boundary's
	  coordinate value.  The corresponding forms s=n-value
	  and
	  w=e-value may be used to set the values of the region's
	  southern and western boundaries, relative to the
	  northern and eastern boundary values.

     g.region raster=soils
	  This form will make the current region settings exactly
	  the same as those given in the cell header file for the
	  raster map layer soils.

     g.region raster=soils zoom=soils
	  This form will first look up the cell header file for
	  the raster map layer soils, use this as the current
	  region setting, and then shrink the region down to the
	  smallest region which still encompasses all non-zero
	  data in the map layer soils.	Note that if the
	  parameter raster=soils were not specified, the zoom
	  would move to encompass all non-zero data values in the
	  soils map that were located within the current region
	  setting.

     g.region -up raster=soils
	  The -u option suppresses the re-setting of the current
	  region definition.  This can be useful when it is
	  desired to only extract region information.  In this
	  case, the cell header file for the soils map layer is
	  printed without changing the current region settings.

     g.region -u raster=soils zoom=soils save=soils
	  This will zoom into the smallest region which
	  encompasses all non-zero soils data values, and save
	  the new region settings in a file to be called soils
	  and stored under the windows directory in the user's
	  current mapset.  The current region settings are not
	  changed.

     g.region -p
	  This will print the current region in the format:

	       projection:   1 (UTM)
	       zone:	     15
	       north:	     4294050.00
	       south:	     4249950.00
	       east:	     526050.00

	       west:	     500950.00
	       nsres:	     100.00
	       ewres:	     100.00
	       rows:	     441
	       cols:	     251

     g.region -g
	  The -g option prints the region in the following
	  format:

	       n=4294050.00
	       s=4249950.00
	       e=526050.00
	       w=500950.00
	       nsres=100.00
	       ewres=100.00

	  This format does not have the rows and columns, but can
	  be fed back into g.region on its command line.

	  The -p (or -g) option is recognized last.  This means
	  that all changes are applied to the region settings
	  before printing occurs.

NOTE
     After all updates have been applied, the current region's
     southern and western boundaries are (silently) adjusted so
     that the north/south distance is a multiple of the
     north/south resolution and that the east/west distance is a
     multiple of the east/west resolution.
