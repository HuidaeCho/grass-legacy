NAME
     s.in.ascii - Converts an ASCII listing of site locations and
     their descriptions into a GRASS site list file.
     (GRASS Sites Program)

SYNOPSIS
     s.in.ascii
     s.in.ascii help
     s.in.ascii sites=name [input=name] [fs=character|space|tab]

DESCRIPTION
     s.in.ascii converts an ASCII listing of site locations and
     category labels into a file in GRASS site list file format.

     Input can be entered via standard input or from the file
     input=name.  Each line of input should contain the easting,
     northing, and (optionally) the category label associated
     with a site.  The fs=name option (where name is either a
     character, a space, or a tab) can be used to specify the use
     of a particular field separator between these three input
     fields.  This is useful when input is obtained from other
     programs (see NOTES, below).  Output is stored in the file
     sites=name and placed in the site_lists directory under the
     user's current mapset.

     The GRASS program s.out.ascii can be used to perform the
     reverse function, converting a file in GRASS site list
     format into an ASCII listing of eastings, northings, and
     category labels associated with site locations.

     Parameters:

     sites=name	       Name of the new GRASS site list file to be
		       output.

     input=name	       Name of an existing ASCII file containing
		       site locations and labels.

     fs=character|space|tab
		       The field separator separating the
		       easting, northing, and category label in
		       each line of the input file.  The field
		       separator can be a character, a space, or
		       a tab.
		       Default:	 space

     s.in.ascii can be run either non-interactively or
     interactively.  The program will be run non-interactively if
     the user specifies a name to be assigned to the sites file
     output, the name of an existing ASCII file containing input,
     and (optionally) a field separator fs appearing in the input
     file, using the form:

s.in.ascii <main>     GRASS Reference Manual	<main> s.in.ascii



	  s.in.ascii sites=name [input=name]
	  [fs=character|space|tab]

     Alternately, the user can simply type s.in.ascii on the
     command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for parameter values using the
     standard GRASS parser interface described in the manual
     entry for parser.	If the user does not specify the name of
     an input file containing site locations and (optionally)
     category labels, these should be entered to the program via
     standard input.

NOTES
     Other GRASS programs can be used to produce output in a
     format suitable for input to s.in.ascii.  For example, the
     user might pipe output produced by d.where into s.in.ascii
     to create a site list file called my.sites containing site
     locations pointed to with the mouse, as illustrated below.
     In this example it was unnecessary to specify the field
     separator used in the input, since d.where output separates
     the easting and northing values with spaces, and spaces are
     the default field separator assumed by s.in.ascii.

	  d.where | s.in.ascii sites=my.sites
