NAME
     d.where - Identifies the geographic coordinates associated
     with point locations in the active frame on the graphics
     monitor.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.where
     d.where help
     d.where [-1] [spheroid=name]

DESCRIPTION
     d.where is an interactive program that allows the user,
     using the pointing device (mouse), to identify the
     geographic coordinates associated with point locations
     within the current geographic region in the active display
     frame on the graphics monitor.

     If the user runs d.where without specifying the name of a
     spheroid on the command line, each mouse click will output
     the UTM easting and northing of the point currently located
     beneath the mouse pointer.	 A mouse-button menu is presented
     so the user knows which mouse buttons to use.  The output is
     always printed to the terminal screen;  if the output is
     redirected into a file, it will be written to the file as
     well.

     Flag:

     -1		       Only one mouse click is executed.
		       This option is provided for shell scripts
		       and programs which want to obtain only one
		       point from the user.  The output is only
		       written to stdout, unless redirected into
		       a file.	The geographic location and mouse
		       button pressed are output.

     Parameter:

     spheroid=name     Name of a spheroid (for latitude/longitude
		       coordinate conversion).
		       Options:	 australian, bessel, clark66,
		       clark80, everest, international, wgs72,
		       wgs84

NOTES
     This program uses the current geographic region setting and
     active frame.  It is not necessary, although useful, to have
     displayed a map in the current frame before running d.where.
