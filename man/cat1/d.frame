NAME
     d.frame - Manages display frames on the user's graphics
     monitor.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.frame
     d.frame help
     d.frame [cepsD] [frame=name] [at=bottom,top,left,right]

DESCRIPTION
     This program manages display frames on the user's graphics
     monitor.  GRASS display programs at run-time connect with
     graphics rendering programs.  While the display programs are
     identical on every hardware platform, the graphics rendering
     programs are (essentially the only GRASS programs) designed
     for individual hardware devices.  These rendering programs
     are managed with the GRASS program d.mon.  Graphics are
     displayed in rectangular frames on whatever graphics monitor
     the user is currently directing GRASS display output to.
     These frames are created and managed with this program, Note
     that GRASS frame contents are not retained when one frame
     covers another.  You cannot shuffle frames from top to
     bottom and then back again.  They simply define rectangular
     areas on the screen where subsequent drawing will occur.
     d.frame.

     Flags:

     -c                Creates a new display frame on the
                       graphics monitor.

     -e                Removes all existing display frames and
                       reinitializes the entire graphics screen
                       (the full-screen display frame).

     -p                Prints the name of the active frame, in
                       which GRASS display output will appear.

     -s                Selects a frame for the display of GRASS
                       graphics.  This frame is then known as the
                       "active frame".

     -D                Prints the status of the user's graphics
                       monitor and active display frame to
                       standard output.  Information includes the
                       name and the dimensions of the current
                       frame on the graphics monitor, given in
                       the form bottom top left right.  This
                       function is useful for debugging output,
                       and for determining display screen
                       coordinates.

     Parameters:

     frame=name        The name of the display frame to be
                       created/selected.

     at=bottom,top,left,right
                       Where to place the frame (implies -c).
                       Frame coordinates are stated in the form:
                       bottom,top,left,right.  The lower-left
                       corner of the graphics monitor always is
                       at location 0,0 while the monitor's
                       upper-right corner is always at 100,100.

NOTES
     If the user has created multiple display frames that overlap
     one another, whatever the user displays in the active frame
     will overwrite those portions of the underlying frame where
     these frames overlap.
