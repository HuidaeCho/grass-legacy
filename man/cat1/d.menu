NAME
     d.menu - Creates and displays a menu within the active frame
     on the graphics monitor.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.menu
     d.menu help
     d.menu [bcolor=name] [tcolor=name] [dcolor=name]
     [size=value]

DESCRIPTION
     d.menu allows the user to create a menu containing a title
     and options, and to display this menu in the active frame on
     the graphics monitor.  After the menu is displayed in the
     active frame, the pointing device (mouse) is activated and
     must be used to select one of the menu options.  The number
     associated with the selected menu option is then printed to
     standard output and the program exits.  This program
     provides GRASS macro writers with a mouse interface for
     users.

     Parameters can be stated on the command line, from within
     standard input, or (as illustrated in EXAMPLE) from within a
     script file.

     The user can specify the menu's background, text, and line
     colors (bcolor, tcolor, and dcolor) and the menu size (size)
     on the command line.  If the user sets at least one of these
     values on the command line, any remaining values that are
     not specified on the command line will be set
     (automatically) to their default values (see below).
     Alternately, the user can simply type d.menu on the command
     line; in this case, the program will prompt the user for the
     menu colors and text size using the standard GRASS parser
     interface described in the manual entry for parser.  The
     user will then be (silently) prompted to enter the menu's
     location and contents through standard input (see Menu
     Information, below).


     Parameters:

     bcolor=name     Sets the color of the menu background (the
		     rectangle on which the text sits).
		     Options:  red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
		     indigo, violet, magenta, brown, gray, white,
		     and black.
		     Default:  black

     tcolor=name     Sets the color of the menu text.
		     Options:  Same as those for bcolor.

		     Default:  white

     dcolor=name     Sets the line color used to divide text
		     lines in the menu.
		     Options:  Same as those for bcolor.
		     Default:  white

     size=value	     Sets the menu's text size to the specified
		     value.  Sizes are stated as percentages of
		     the height of the active graphics display
		     frame.
		     Options:  1 - 100
		     Default:  3  (i.e., 3%)


     Menu Information:
     After the user has (optionally) specified menu colors and
     size, the program expects the user to enter information
     about the menu's location and content.  The menu will be
     placed in the lower left corner of the active display frame
     by default if the user does not position it elsewhere using
     the .T or .L commands.
     The user specifies the menu contents by typing in a menu
     title followed by the option choices to appear in the menu
     when displayed.  The user must enter a menu title and at
     least one menu option.


      .T value	     Specifies the menu's distance from the
		     active display frame's top edge (as a
		     percentage of the active frame's height).
		     Note:  Not required

      .L value	     Specifies the menu's distance from the
		     active display frame's left edge (as a
		     percentage of the active frame's width).
		     Note:  Not required

     menu title	     A title that describes the type of options
		     listed in the menu, and that will appear at
		     the top of the menu when it is displayed.

     option name(s)  The options that will appear in the menu
		     when displayed.  Each menu option should
		     appear on a separate line.	 The user may
		     enter as many options as desired, but must
		     enter at least one menu option.
		     Note:  The user should choose a menu size
		     and location that will allow all menu
		     options to be displayed in the active frame.

d.menu <main>	      GRASS Reference Manual	    <main> d.menu



     If the user enters the menu title and option(s) from
     standard input (i.e., at the keyboard rather than from a
     file), the user should enter  control-d to end input and
     display the menu in the active frame on the graphics
     monitor.  (Note:  The d.menu program can also be
     incorporated into UNIX Bourne shell script macros.	 The
     below example shows how this might be done.)

EXAMPLE
     In the following example, the shell script menu2 calls the
     shell script color.select which contains d.menu commands to
     display a menu in the current frame on the graphics monitor.
     After the user selects an option from the display menu, the
     selection number is available for use by menu2.

      Contents of file menu2:

      #! /bin/csh -f
     set option = 0
     set colors = (red green blue black white )
     @ option = `color.select`

     if ($option <= 5) then
	  set color = $colors[$option]
	  echo $color

     endif

     exit

     Contents of file color.select:

      #! /bin/csh -f
     d.menu bcolor=red tcolor=green dcolor=yellow size=5 << EOF
      .T 25
      .L 25
      Color Choices
      Option 1
      Option 2
      Option 3
      Option 4
      Option 5
      EOF

     If the user runs menu2, a menu will be displayed on the
     graphics monitor that has red background, green text, with
     menu options divided by yellow lines, and a text size of 5%
     of the active display frame height.  The mouse cursor will
     become active, allowing the user to select (by pointing with
     the mouse) one of the displayed menu options.  Here, these
     menu options are called Option 1, Option 2, and Option 3,
     etc.  The first line of text (here, the words Color Choices)

     contains the title of the menu;  this line is not a menu
     option that can be chosen by the user with the mouse.  When
     the user presses one of the mouse buttons while pointing to
     the desired menu choice, the number of the option chosen
     will be available for capture by the shell script menu2.
     menu2 is a simple example that takes this information and
     only echoes it to the screen.

NOTES
     Although the user can vary text size, all text within the
     same menu is displayed in a single text size (and font).  If
     the user specifies that items included in the menu's text be
     displayed in different sizes, all text will be displayed in
     the size stated last.
