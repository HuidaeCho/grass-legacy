NAME
     v.stats - Prints information about a binary GRASS vector map
     layer.
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.stats
     v.stats help
     v.stats [-h] map=name

DESCRIPTION
     The program v.stats will print to standard output
     information about a user-specified binary GRASS vector map
     layer.

     Flag:

     -h                Display header information from the vector
                       file.

     Parameter:

     map=name          Name of the binary GRASS vector file to be
                       queried.

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies the parameter value and (optionally) sets the -h
     flag on the command line, using the form:

          v.stats [-h] map=name

     If the user instead simply types v.stats without specifying
     program arguments on the command line, the program will
     prompt the user to enter inputs through the standard user
     interface described in the manual entry for parser.

NOTES
     Sample output follows:

          Format: Version 4.0  (Level 2 access)  (Portable)

          Number of Lines: 3
          Number of Nodes: 2
          Number of Areas: 2   (complete)
          Number of Isles: 1   (complete)
          Number of Atts : 2


     The GRASS version number is given.  Parenthetical text
     following this describes the read access level available and
     notes whether or not the file is in GRASS version 4.0
     portable data format.  The access level indicates the types

     of data available for the named vector map layer.  "Level 1"
     denotes a binary vector file (without any accompanying
     dig_plus file), while "Level 2" denotes the existence of a
     dig_plus (vector topology) file for the named map layer
     (generally created by v.support).  If only Level 1
     information is available for a vector map layer, only the
     number of lines and (optionally) the file header will be
     printed to standard output.

     If all areas and islands (isles) in the vector file have
     been identified (usually by v.support), their counts will be
     followed by "complete." If not, they will be followed by
     "incomplete".  The dig_plus file, which is created and
     updated by v.support, must exist for this information to be
     output.
