NAME
     v.in.ascii - Converts ASCII vector map layers into binary
     vector map layers.
     (GRASS Vector Data Import Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.in.ascii
     v.in.ascii help
     v.in.ascii input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     v.in.ascii converts a vector map in ASCII format to a vector
     map in binary format.  The user can run this program non-
     interactively by specifying all program options on the
     command line, in the form:

	  v.in.ascii input=name output=name

     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of an ASCII vector file to be
		       converted to binary vector file.

     output=name       Name given to binary vector output file.

     If the user runs v.in.ascii without giving program arguments
     on the command line, the program will prompt the user for
     input and output file names.

NOTES
     After running this program, GRASS support files must be
     built for the binary output file before the user can use the
     file in v.digit.  The user can run v.support to create GRASS
     support files for the output file.

     The GRASS program v.out.ascii performs the function of
     v.in.ascii in reverse;  i.e., it converts vector files in
     binary format to ASCII format.  These two companion programs
     are useful both for importing and exporting vector files
     between GRASS and other software, and for transferring data
     between machines.

     The output from v.in.ascii will be placed into
     $LOCATION/dig.
