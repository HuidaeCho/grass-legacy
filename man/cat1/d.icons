NAME
     d.icons - Displays points, as icons, at user-defined
     locations in the active display frame on the graphics
     monitor.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.icons
     d.icons help
     d.icons [-r] icon=name [color=name] [size=value]
     [points=name]

DESCRIPTION
     d.icons graphically displays point (site) locations as icons
     in the active frame on the graphics monitor.  Geographic
     coordinates are read either from standard input or from an
     input file whose name is stated by the user.  At each site
     location, a user-defined icon is displayed.

OPTIONS
     The user must enter at least the name of an icon file
     storing a graphic representation of the icon to be
     displayed, and the geographic coordinates of the points at
     which they will appear.

     The user can run this program either non-interactively or
     interactively.  The program will be run non-interactively if
     the user specifies the name of an icon file and (optionally)
     any other desired parameters on the command line, using the
     form:

	  d.icons [-r] icon=name [color=name] [size=value]
	  [points=name]

     If the user fails to specify the name of a points file on
     the command line, the program will prompt the user to enter
     geographic coordinates from standard input.  If the user
     specifies at least the name of an icon file on the command
     line, any other parameter values left unspecified by the
     user will be set to their default values (see below).

     Alternately, the user can simply type:

	  d.icons

     on the command line, without program arguments.  In this
     case, the user will be prompted for needed parameter values
     using the standard GRASS user interface described in the
     manual entry for parser.  The geographic coordinates at
     which icons are to be displayed can still be input from an
     input file (points) in interactive use.

     Flag:

     -r		       Coordinates are input in reverse order
		       (i.e., as northing  easting).


     Parameters:

     icon=name	       The name of an existing file containing a
		       graphic representation of the icon to be
		       drawn.  icon files can be created by the
		       user using the p.icons command and are
		       stored under the icons directory under the
		       user's current mapset.

     color=name	       Sets the current icon color to the name
		       stated.
		       Options:	 red, orange, yellow, green,
		       blue, indigo, violet, gray, white, and
		       black
		       Default:	 color=white

     size=value	       The icon scaling factor.
		       Options:	 1-1000
		       Default:	 size=1

     points=name       The name of a UNIX file containing the
		       geographic coordinates of sites at which
		       icons are to be drawn.  Since this is a
		       UNIX file, the user should specify the
		       name using standard UNIX file naming
		       conventions.  If this file is not in the
		       user's current working directory, its
		       pathname should be specified.  The file
		       contents should consist of a series of
		       geographic coordinates that fall within
		       the boundaries of the current geographic
		       region.	Each site location should be
		       stated on a separate line as an easting
		       and northing (in that order) separated by
		       a single blank space.  If no points file
		       is specified by the user, input is taken
		       from standard input and should be given in
		       the same form; to end standard input, type
		       end (or press control-d).

EXAMPLE
     An icons file contains a graphic representation of the icon
     to be displayed.  Here, spaces represent areas of no color,
     and x's represent areas of color.	For example, the user
     might construct an icon resembling a cross in the following
     way:

d.icons <main>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <main> d.icons



	    x
	    x
	  xxxxx
	    x
	    x
	    x

     This icon might be stored in a file called cross (under the
     user's $LOCATION/icons directory).	 If the user specified
     that this be the icon file used while running d.icons, this
     cross would then appear in the color and size specified by
     the user, at each site location named in the points file.

     Note:  icons are created with the p.icons command.

     The points file lists the geographic coordinates of site
     locations (at which icons will be displayed).  This file
     should take the form:

	  easting northing
	  easting northing
	  easting northing
	   ...

     If the user sets the -r flag, the order of these coordinates
     should be reversed (i.e., coordinates should be given as
     northing easting).

     If the points file is not specified, then the corrdinates
     are read from the keyboard or across a pipe. This feature
     allows users to enter the coordinates by hand, or, more
     usefully, to get then from another program. For example, to
     display icons at locations specified in a sites list:
	  s.out.ascii name | d.icons icon=cross
     where name is the name of a site list, and cross is the name
     of an icon.
