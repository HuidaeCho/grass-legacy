r.patch	<main>	     GRASS Reference Manual	   <main> r.patch



NAME
     r.patch - Creates a composite raster map layer by using
     known category values from	one (or	more) map layer(s) to
     fill in areas of "no data"	in another map layer.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.patch
     r.patch help
     r.patch [-q] input=name[,name,...]	output=name

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS program r.patch allows the user to assign known
     data values from other raster map layers to the "no data"
     areas (those assigned category value 0) in	another	raster
     map layer.	 This program is useful	for making a composite
     raster map	layer from two or more adjacent	map layers, for
     filling in	"holes"	in a raster map	layer's	data (e.g., in
     digital elevation data), or for updating an older map layer
     with more recent data.

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies program arguments on the	command	line, using the
     form

	  r.patch [-q] input=name[,name,...] output=name

     where each	input name is the name of a raster map layer to
     be	patched, the output name is the	name assigned to the new
     composite raster map layer	containing the patched result,
     and the (optional)	-q flag	directs	r.patch	to run quietly.

     The first name listed in the string input=name,name,name,
     ...  is the name of the base map whose zero data values will
     be	attempted to be	filled by non-zero data	values in the
     second through tenth input	name maps listed.  The second
     through tenth input name maps will	be used	to supply
     remaining missing (zero) data values for the first	input map
     name, based on the	order in which they are	listed in the
     string input=name,name,name, ....

     Alternately, the user can simply type r.patch on the command
     line, without program arguments.  In this case, the user
     will be prompted for the flag setting and parameter values
     using the standard	GRASS parser interface described in the
     manual entry for parser.

     Flag:

     -q		       Directs that r.patch run	quietly,
		       suppressing output of messages on program
		       progress	to standard output.

     Parameters:

     input=name,name,...
		       The name(s) of between one and ten
		       existing	raster map layers to be	patched
		       together.  The first of the ten maps
		       listed will be used as a	base map, and the
		       second through tenth maps listed	will be
		       used to supply missing (zero) category
		       values for the first map.

     output=name       The name	of the new raster map to contain
		       the resultant patched output.

EXAMPLE
     Below, the	raster map layer on the	far left is patched with
     the middle	(patching) raster map layer, to	produce	the
     composite raster map layer	on the right.

	  1 1 1	0 2 2 0	0    0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0	1 1 1 1	2 2 0 0
	  1 1 0	2 2 2 0	0    0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0	1 1 1 2	2 2 0 0
	  3 3 3	3 2 2 0	0    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	3 3 3 3	2 2 0 0
	  3 3 3	3 0 0 0	0    4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 3 3 3	4 4 4 4
	  3 3 3	0 0 0 0	0    4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	3 3 3 4	4 4 4 4
	  0 0 0	0 0 0 0	0    4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4	4 4 4 4	4 4 4 4

     Switching the patched and the patching raster map layers
     produces the following results:

	  0 0 1	1 0 0 0	0    1 1 1 0 2 2 0 0	1 1 1 1	2 2 0 0
	  0 0 1	1 0 0 0	0    1 1 0 2 2 2 0 0	1 1 1 1	2 2 0 0
	  0 0 0	0 0 0 0	0    3 3 3 3 2 2 0 0	3 3 3 3	2 2 0 0
	  4 4 4	4 4 4 4	4    3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0	4 4 4 4	4 4 4 4
	  4 4 4	4 4 4 4	4    3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0	4 4 4 4	4 4 4 4
	  4 4 4	4 4 4 4	4    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	4 4 4 4	4 4 4 4

NOTES
     Frequently, this program is used to patch together	adjacent
     map layers	which have been	digitized separately.  The
     programs v.mkquads	and v.mkgrid can be used to make adjacent
     maps align	neatly.

     The user should check the current geographic region settings
     before running r.patch, to	ensure that the	region boundaries
     encompass all of the data desired to be included in the
     composite map.

     Use of r.patch is generally followed by use of the	GRASS
     programs g.remove and g.rename;  g.remove is used to remove
     the original (un-patched) raster map layers, while	g.rename
     is	used to	then assign to the newly-created composite
     (patched) raster map layer	the name of the	original raster

     r.patch creates support files for the patched, composite
     output map.
