NAME
     r.water.fea - Finite element analysis program for hydrologic
     simulations.

     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.water.fea


OVERVIEW
     r.water.fea is an interactive program that	allows the user
     to	simulate storm water runoff analysis using the finite
     element numerical technique.  Infiltration	is calculated
     using the Green and Ampt formulation. r.water.fea computes
     and draws hydrographs for every basin as well as at stream
     junctions in an analysis area. It also draws animation maps
     at	the basin level.


DATA REQUIREMENTS
     The maps required by r.water.fea  are:

     1)	Basin map
     2)	Stream map
     3)	Drainage map
     4)	Accumulation map
     5)	Slope map

     The other data requirements of r.water.fea	are the
     parameters	needed to calculate infiltration and the channel
     roughness parameter. Model	parameters may be provided either
     in	the form of maps or as values:

     1)	Manning	roughness coefficient map or basin value
     2)	Saturated hydraulic conductivity map or	basin value
     3)	Suction	head at	wetting	front map or basin value
     4)	Effective porosity map or basin	value
     5)	Degree of saturation basin value


DESCRIPTION
     On	running	r.water.fea for	the first time,	the directory
     r.water.fea is created under $LOCATION. When the user runs
     r.water.fea, the program will prompt the user for the
     project name. The project name refers to the directory that
     is	created	under the r.water.fea directory. All files (not
     maps) related to the analysis carried out by r.water.fea are
     stored under this directory. If the project does not exist
     then the user is further requested	for the	input maps. If
     the project already exists, then the program looks	for the
     proper project related files to proceed with stopped work.

     Configuration

     The user is  asked	for the	following  configuration modes:

     I)	Rainfall mode: The rainfall mode is defined as follows:

	  1 = spatially	uniform	and constant in	time
	  2 = spatially	uniform	but varying in time

     If	the user decides to use	mode 2,	then a mechanism is
     provided to allow creation	of a rainfall rate file
     (described	in step	4).

     II) Basin-level hydrographs: This configuration mode allows
     the user to view intermediate hydrographs for every basin.
     The hydrographs will be displayed on the graphics monitor.
     Each basin	is considered to be independent	of every other
     basin in the analysis area.

     III) Basin-level animation	maps: This configuration mode
     allows the	user to	create time-series maps	for later
     animation of flow depth for all the basins	that have been
     analyzed. All animation maps use a	multiplication factor of
     1000.  The	map cell value divided by the multiplication
     factor yields the actual value of flow depth in meters. The
     user will require enough file space in the	GRASS database
     for this configuration. All animation map names have the
     following naming scheme:

	  fea.<project_name>.#

     Here '#' represents the time step.	One time step refers to
     1/40th of the total monitoring time. Twenty maps are created
     at	every other time step.

     Program flow

     The basin and stream maps are displayed on	the monitor when
     the user starts working on	a project. The entire analysis is
     divided into a number of steps.  The user is presented with
     a menu to proceed through the set of steps	to facilitate
     easy changes to the simulation for	a given	analysis area or
     to	stop analysis between menu steps and continue at a more
     convenient	time.

     The main menu is shown below:


     Choose from the menu:


	   *   1. Process steps	without	breaks.



GRASS 4.3		Baylor University			2






r.water.fea <main>   GRASS Reference Manual    <main> r.water.fea



	  *->  2. Select basins	for simulation.
	   X   3. Extract topographical	data.
	   X   4. Select hydraulic parameters and simulation
     time.
	   X   5. Basin	simulation.
	   X   6. Simulate any particular basin.
	   X   7. Channel routing of basin hydrographs.
	   *   8. Stop.


     You are starting from the beginning.

     Choice:

     The "X", "*", and "*->" above have	the following meaning.


     *	     The user can select this part from	the menu.

     *->     This is the step that the user must select	in order
	     to	proceed	in a sequence.

     X	     The user can not select these parts of the	menu
	     (until previous steps have	been executed).


     Throughout	the program the	symbols	described above	change as
     the user moves from step to step.	The message just above
     the Choice	prompt signals the status of the program, and
     guides the	user as	to what	should be the next step.



     1.	Process	steps without breaks.
	     This  part	of the menu will not prompt for	steps 2-
	     5,	7 and will carry out all the analysis. The user
	     will find it advantageous to use this step	when
	     analyzing a small area or a few basins.


     2.	Select basins for simulation.
	     This part of the menu draws the basin and stream
	     maps for the user to select the area of analysis.
	     The mouse is then activated to provide a point and
	     click environment for the user to select basins in
	     the area of analysis. Upon	successfully selecting
	     the basins	the user is given the choice of	deleting
	     basins from the selected area. The	basin topology is
	     then determined and information on	basin statistics
	     is	gathered. The information on connectivity between
	     basins is stored in the input.basin file and the
	     information on basin statistics is	stored in the



GRASS 4.3		Baylor University			3






r.water.fea <main>   GRASS Reference Manual    <main> r.water.fea



	     basin_info	file. Two reclass maps describing the
	     analysis area are also created. The maps have the
	     following naming scheme:

	     fea.stream.<project_name>
	     fea.basin.<project_name>

	     The user should avoid using these names to	create
	     other maps. Once these maps are created the user
	     should not	destroy	them, if the user wishes to
	     continue working on the project.


     3.	Extract	topographical data.
	     This part of the menu generates information about
	     the connectivity between cells and	boundary
	     conditions. This information is stored in the
	     input.file	file in	the project directory.	If the
	     animation configuration has been set then another
	     file called coordinates is	created	in the project
	     directory.	This file contains information on the
	     coordinates of every cell in the analysis area.



     4.	Select hydraulic parameters and	simulation time.
	     This part of the menu carries out two tasks. The
	     first task	involves querying the user for simulation
	     parameters. The simulation	parameters include
	     duration of rainfall, maximum intensity, time step
	     for simulation, monitoring	time and names of
	     simulation	maps if	any. The second	task involves
	     querying channel characteristics assuming the
	     channels as trapezoidal cross-sections. The user is
	     required to provide channel side slope, channel
	     bottom width and the channel roughness coefficient
	     values for	every stream category.

	     The program creates a file	timedata in the	project
	     directory to store	information from this part of the
	     menu. If the user has selected the	"Spatially
	     uniform and time varying rainfall"	mode (mode = 2),
	     then the user is queried for the the name of a time
	     file. If the file does not	exist then a screen like
	     the one shown below appears:

------------------------------------------------------------------



	     It	is important to	note  that the values in the time
	     column should be in an increasing order. It is also
	     not necessary to fill all the rows	and the	user can
	     stop after	filling	only a few rows. The number of
	     lines are limited to fifteen. If more than	fifteen
	     lines are required	then the user will have	to create
	     the file using an editor. In that case the	user
	     should just type the time since commencement of
	     rainfall (minutes)	in the first column followed by
	     the rainfall intensity (cm/hr) in the second column
	     as	shown below:

				  10   2.54
				  30   4.52
				  60   5.62


     5.	Basin simulation.
	     This part of the menu carries out the simulation for
	     each basin	in the area of analysis. Every basin is
	     analyzed as independent of	every other basin.  The
	     user is shown the independent basin hydrograph for
	     every basin on the	graphics monitor. The file
	     disch.basin is created  towards the end of



GRASS 4.3		Baylor University			5






r.water.fea <main>   GRASS Reference Manual    <main> r.water.fea



	     simulation	of all the basins. This	file contains
	     columns of	discharge for each basin. The column
	     number corresponds	to the basin category value in
	     the legend. If the	animation configuration	mode was
	     set then a	file is	created	in the project directory
	     called disch_file . This file holds basin discharge
	     values at every point in every basin of the analysis
	     area.


     6.	Simulate any particular	basin.
	     This part of the menu provides the	facility of
	     changing basin characteristics such as the	Manning
	     roughness coefficient and other infiltration
	     parameters.  This choice can be used only after the
	     successful	completion of choice 5.	If the user has
	     provided maps for the parameters then the user
	     should select "stop" from the menu	to make	changes
	     to	the parameter maps provided to the model.


     7.	Channel	routing	of basin hydrographs.
	     This part of the menu connects the	basins that were
	     considered	independent in the previous step. Routing
	     of	the basin-level	hydrographs is done based on the
	     connectivity between basins. This can generate
	     hydrographs only for seven	stream junctions. If
	     there are more than seven stream junctions	then the
	     first seven stream	junction hydrographs are shown.
	     The process of drawing individual basin animation
	     maps follows the drawing of the hydrographs at
	     stream junctions.	After completing this choice a
	     file disch.junction is created. This file contains
	     discharge values at different steps for every stream
	     junction.


     8.	Stop.
	     This part of the menu is available	to the user at
	     any time between the different choices described in
	     the menu and exits	the user out of	the program.


LIMITATIONS
     1.) Negative values of drainage direction inside basins maps
     cannot be accepted. Negative values are generated as a
     result of incomplete information regarding	the basin
     drainage pattern (e.g., r.watershed produces negative values
     as	a result of outflowing drainage	basins).

     2.) The drainage map should route the water and not form
     pits, lakes, or ponds.  Note that this does not imply that



GRASS 4.3		Baylor University			6






r.water.fea <main>   GRASS Reference Manual    <main> r.water.fea



     the DEM by	itself should not have any pits.

     3)	Interstorm modeling, interflow,	or baseflow are	not
     considered.

     4)	Backwater effects are not considered.

     5)	The kinematic wave analogy is appropriate where	the land
     surface slope and channel slope are large.	This may not be
     true in flat, marshy terrain and in slow, meandering river
     channels.


OUTPUT FILES OF	INTEREST
     These are ASCII files that	can be found in	the
     $LOCATION/r.water.fea/<project_name> directory.  The files
     have a format such	that it	can be imported	to various
     analysis packages.


     disch.basin
	     This file contains	multiple columns which contain
	     the individual basin discharge values in order of
	     first column containing the discharge values for
	     basin one and the second for basin	two and	so on.


     disch.junction
	     This file contains	the results of the discharge
	     values at stream junctions	specified by the icons.
	     The first column in this file shows the time step in
	     minutes. The remaining columns specify the	discharge
	     values. The first row specifies the stream	junction
	     icon numbers.


NOTES
     1.	r.water.fea alters the region in the WIND file.	This is
     done by making a systems call to:

       g.region	align=name

     just when the program r.water.fea is run.

     2.	A small	watershed can be analyzed by providing values of
     model parameters.	However	it is advisble to provide maps of
     various model parameters if there are many	basins in the
     watershed.	 In the	former case the	value provided by the
     user shall	be constant for	the entire basin for which the
     value is queried. The user	shall create the infiltration
     maps using	the following set of rules. The	map value divided
     by	the multiplication factor yields the actual value in the



GRASS 4.3		Baylor University			7






r.water.fea <main>   GRASS Reference Manual    <main> r.water.fea



     described units:

      Parameter				  Multiplication factor

      Soil saturated hydraulic
      conductivity map (meters/sec)	       10,000,000

      Manning roughness	coefficient		  1000

      Soil suction at wetting front (m)		  1000

      Soil porosity map	(m3/m3)			  1000


     3.	If the user has	provided a slope map that has zero slope
     value anywhere in the map,	then a slope value of 5% is
     assumed for that cell.

     4.	It is preferred	that none of the basins	in the analysis
     area has more than	750 cells, as this will	increase the
     computation time drastically.  The	number of cells	in a
     basin can be controlled by	setting	the threshold value to
     small values when running r.watershed.

     5.	Using larger cells can speed up	the analysis process
     significantly. It is important to note that r.watershed
     should be run for the resolution at which the user	desires
     to	run the	r.water.fea analysis.

     All the files listed below	are ASCII files. None of these
     files should be deleted if	the user wishes	to continue
     working on	the same project.
