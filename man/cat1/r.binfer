NAME
     r.binfer - Bayesian expert system development program.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.binfer
     r.binfer help
     r.binfer [-v] input=name [output=name]

DESCRIPTION
     r.binfer is an expert system shell containing an inference
     engine based on Bayesian statistics (reasoning from past
     experience).  It is designed to assist human experts in a
     field develop computerized expert systems for land use
     planning and management.  These expert systems are designed
     to aid non-experts make decisions about land use.

     In Bayesian expert system programs like r.binfer, the system
     bases the probable impacts of a future land use action on
     the conditional probabilities about the impact of similar
     past actions.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flags:

     -v		       Run verbosely, displaying messages on
		       debugging output to standard output.
		       Includes a listing of the symbol table
		       used by r.binfer.

     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of an existing file containing
		       analysis instructions.

     output=name       Name to be assigned to the file to contain
		       program output.
		       Default:	 binfer.out

     Using appropriate r.binfer syntax, the human expert
     structures an input knowledge/control script with an
     appropriate combination of map layer category values (GRASS
     raster map layers that contain data on soil texture, slope,
     density, etc.)  and attributes relevant to decision-making
     (e.g., rainfall, temperature, season, subjective judgement,
     etc.).  Options exist for specifying a user interface and a
     data base containing prior and conditional probabilities
     necessary to infer the value of a goal attribute.	The
     expert also specifies the format for display of end results
     (raster map layers) in the input script.  New raster map
     layers -- one for each possible inferred attribute value --
     are created that contain the probability of the inferred

     attribute value occurring in each grid cell.

     Alternately, a single new map layer called r.binfer (or
     whatever output name is specified by the user) is also
     output.  This map shows, for each grid cell, the inferred
     attribute value that has the highest probability of
     occurring in each grid cell, given the values of the input
     raster map layer and contextual attributes.

     r.binfer scripts are typed into a file by the user using a
     system editor like vi, and then input to r.binfer as the
     input file named on the command line.  For a complete
     description of the input syntax, see the document GRASS
     Tutorial:	r.binfer (forthcoming).	 For example r.binfer
     scripts see the EXAMPLES section below.  The results are
     used to generate the new raster map layers in the user's
     current mapset.

     As stated above, r.binfer scripts contain descriptions of
     two types of input attributes.  The map layer type
     attributes are actual GRASS raster map layers, with the
     values defined to be ranges of the categories within that
     raster map layer.	For example, if the user chooses slope as
     one of the layer attributes, the possible values for the
     slope attribute might be the following:

	     flat      (slopes between 0 and 5 degrees)
	     low      (slopes between 6 and 10 degrees)
	     medium   (slopes between 11 and 30 degrees)
	     steep     (slopes greater than 31 degrees)

     The contextual attributes are those that do not represent
     raster map layers, but rather, information that reflects
     criteria relevant to the specific decision being
     contemplated.  For example, if the user chooses "rainfall
     amount" as one of the contextual attributes, possible values
     assigned to the "rainfall amount" attribute might be the
     following:

       low	     (rainfall amounts less than an inch)
       medium	(rainfall amounts between one and three inches)
       high	  (rainfall amounts grater than three inches)

     The inferred attribute values are specified along with a
     prior probability and a table of conditional probabilities
     that indicate the probability of that inferred attribute
     value occurring given that an input attribute value has
     occurred.

     r.binfer will determine the value of contextual attributes
     by prompting the user for input.  It will then open each of
     the raster map layers corresponding to each map layer

     attribute.	 r.binfer then determines the values for all map
     layer attributes in each grid cell.  Using the conditional
     probability tables, the prior probabilities, and Bayes'
     theorem, r.binfer calculates the output probabilities for
     each inferred value and writes its probability of occurrence
     as a percentage.  It also determines which value is most
     likely to occur in that cell and writes that to the output
     file name.

EXAMPLES
     The two sample scripts shown below illustrate only the use
     of r.binfer to: (1) estimate the probability that an
     avalanche will occur, and (2) infer the probability of
     finding pine mountain beetles, at each cell across a
     landscape, given the input map layer attributes shown below.
     The author makes no claims as to the correctness of using
     these criteria to infer either event.


			 Some Notes on Script Construction.


     1. No Data ( or what to do with category zero).

	If category zero is excluded from the ranges of any layer
	attribute value, it is treated as "no data" and the
	resulting probability and combined maps will reflect
     this.

	Otherwise, category zero is treated just like any other
     cell value.

     2. Category ranges for layer attributes.

	The category ranges are specified using r.reclass rules.
	For example, a value list for slope might look like this:

	  (flat [0 1 thru 3], gentle [4 thru 8], moderate [9 thru
     15],
	   other [16 thru 89]).

     3. Question Attachments.

	Question attachments can be supplied for and context
     attribute or
	attribute value.  If names are chosen cleverly, the
     default menu
	should be sufficient.

     4. Determinant List.

	At this time the determinant list serves no real purpose.

	Planned extensions to binfer will make use of this list,
	so just don't use it for now.

     5. Probabilities.

	The conditional probability table is very important, try
     to
	be sure of its accuracy.
