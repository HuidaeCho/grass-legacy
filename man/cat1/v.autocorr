NAME
     v.autocorr - Calculate spatial autocorrelation statistics
     for GRASS vector file.
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.autocorr
     v.autocorr help
     v.autocorr [-chnqw] vect=name [output=name]

DESCRIPTION
     v.autocorr uses a labeled binary vector file (vect=name) to
     calculate spatial autocorrelation statistics for areas.  The
     output may either be printed to the screen or saved to a
     file (vect=name).

     Flags:

     -c		       Print the connectivity matrix.

     -w		       Print the weight matrix (a re-expression
		       of the connectivity matrix).

     -n		       Suppress calculation of statistics. Useful
		       when used with -c or -w.

     -h		       Do calculations for hypothesis testing.
		       Warning: this is intensive!

     -q		       Quiet. Cut out the chatter.

     Parameters:

     vect=name	       Name of a labeled binary vector file.  The
		       categories values must be numeric.

     output=name       Name of the output file.

     v.autocorr can be run either non-interactively or
     interactively.  The program will be run non-interactively if
     the user specifies the name of a labeled binary vector file.

     Alternately, the user can simply type v.autocorr on the
     command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for parameter values using the
     standard GRASS parser interface described in the manual
     entry for parser.

     RANLIB.C, a library of C routines for random number
     generation compiled and written by Barry W. Brown and James
     Lovato of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University
     of Texas, was adapted for use by this program.

BUGS
     The -w flag does not work yet.
     This program only works for fully labeled vector files (with
     sequential categories beginning with 1). I don't know what
     it will do in any other situation.
     Please send all bug fixes and comments to the author.
