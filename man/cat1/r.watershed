NAME
     r.watershed - Watershed basin analysis program.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.watershed
     r.watershed help
     r.watershed [-m4] elevation=name [depression=name] [flow=name]
        [disturbed.land=name|value] [blocking=name] [threshold=value] [max.slope.length=value]
        [accumulation=name] [drainage=name] [basin=name] [stream=name]
        [half.basin=name] [visual=name] [length.slope=name] [slope.steepness=name] [armsed=name]

DESCRIPTION
     r.watershed generates a set of maps indicating: 1) the
     location of watershed basins, 2) information to interface
     with ARMSED, a storm-water runoff and sedimentation yield
     model, and 3) the LS and S factors of the Revised Universal
     Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE).

     r.watershed can be run either interactively or non-
     interactively.  If the user types

          r.watershed

     on the command line without program arguments, the program
     will prompt the user with a verbose description of the input
     maps.  The interactive version of r.watershed can prepare
     inputs to lumped-parameter hydrologic models.  After a
     verbose interactive session, r.watershed will query the user
     for a number of map layers.  Each map layer's values will be
     tabulated by watershed basin and sent to an output file.
     This output file is organized to ease data entry into a
     lumped-parameter hydrologic model program.  The non-
     interactive version of r.watershed cannot create this file.

     The user can run the program non-interactively, by
     specifying input map names on the command line.  Parameter
     names may be specified by their full names, or by any
     initial string that distinguish them from other parameter
     names.  In r.watershed's case, the first two letters of each
     name sufficiently distinguishes parameter names.  For
     example, the two expressions below are equivalent inputs to
     r.watershed:

       r.watershed el=elev.map th=100 st=stream.map ba=basin.map

       r.watershed elevation=elev.map threshold=100
       stream=stream.map basin=basin.map

OPTIONS
     -m   Without this flag set, the entire analysis is run in
          memory maintained by the operating system.  This can be

          limiting, but is relatively fast.  Setting the flag
          causes the program to manage memory on disk which
          allows larger maps to be processes but is considerably
          slower.

     -4   Allow only horizontal and vertical flow of water.
          Stream and slope lengths are approximately the same as
          outputs from default surface flow (allows horizontal,
          vertical, and diagonal flow of water).  This flag will
          also make the drainage basins look more homogeneous.

     elevation
          Input map: Elevation on which entire analysis is based.

     depression
          Input map:  Map layer of actual depressions in the
          landscape that are large enough to slow and store
          surface runoff from a storm event.  Any non-zero values
          indicate depressions.

     flow Input map: amount of overland flow per cell.  This map
          indicates the amount of overland flow units that each
          cell will contribute to the watershed basin model.
          Overland flow units represent the amount of overland
          flow each cell contributes to surface flow.  If
          omitted, a value of one (1) is assumed.

     disturbed.land
          Raster map input layer or value containing the percent
          of disturbed land (i.e., croplands, and construction
          sites) where the raster or input value of 17 equals
          17%.  If no map or value is given, r.watershed assumes
          no disturbed land.  This input is used for the RUSLE
          calculations.

     blocking
          Input map: terrain that will block overland surface
          flow.  Terrain that will block overland surface flow
          and restart the slope length for the RUSLE.  Any non-
          zero values indicate blocking terrain.

     threshold
          The minimum size of an exterior watershed basin in
          cells, or overland flow units.

     max.slope.length
          Input value indicating the maximum length of overland
          surface flow in meters.  If overland flow travels
          greater than the maximum length, the program assumes
          the maximum length (it assumes that landscape
          characteristics not discernable in the digital
          elevation model exist that maximize the slope length).

          This input is used for the RUSLE calculations and is a
          sensitive parameter.

     accumulation
          Output map: number of cells that drain through each
          cell.  The absolute value of each cell in this output
          map layer is the amount of overland flow that traverses
          the cell.  This value will be the number of upland
          cells plus one if no overland flow map is given.  If
          the overland flow map is given, the value will be in
          overland flow units.  Negative numbers indicate that
          those cells possibly have surface runoff from outside
          of the current geographic region.  Thus, any cells with
          negative values cannot have their surface runoff and
          sedimentation yields calculated accurately.

     drainage
          Output map: drainage direction.  Provides the "aspect"
          for each cell.  Multiplying positive values by 45 will
          give the direction in degrees that the surface runoff
          will travel from that cell.  The value -1 indicates
          that the cell is a depression area (defined by the
          depression input map).  Other negative values indicate
          that surface runoff is leaving the boundaries of the
          current geographic region.  The absolute value of these
          negative cells indicates the direction of flow.

     basin
          Output map: Unique label for each watershed basin.
          Each basin will be given a unique positive even
          integer.  Areas along edges may not be large enough to
          create an exterior watershed basin.  0 values indicate
          that the cell is not part of a complete watershed basin
          in the current geographic region.

     stream
          Output map: stream segments.  Values correspond to the
          watershed basin values.

     half.basin
          Output map: each half-basin is given a unique value.
          Watershed basins are divided into left and right sides.
          The right-hand side cell of the watershed basin
          (looking upstream) are given even values corresponding
          to the watershed basin values.  The left-hand side
          cells of the watershed basin are given odd values which
          are one less than the value of the watershed basin.

     visual
          Output map: useful for visual display of results.
          Surface runoff accumulation with the values modified to
          provide for easy display.  All negative accumulation

          values are changed to zero.  All positive values above
          the basin threshold are given the value of the basin
          threshold.

     length.slope
          Output map: slope length and steepness (LS) factor.
          Contains the LS factor for the Revised Universal Soil
          Loss Equation.  Equations taken from Revised Universal
          Soil Loss Equation for Western Rangelands (see SEE ALSO
          section).  Since the LS factor is a small number, it is
          multiplied by 100 for the GRASS output map.

     slope.steepness
          Output map: slope steepness (S) factor for RUSLE.
          Contains the revised S factor for the Universal Soil
          Loss Equation.  Equations taken from article entitled
          Revised Slope Steepness Factor for the Universal Soil
          Loss Equation (see SEE ALSO section).  Since the S
          factor is a small number (usually less than one), it is
          multiplied by 100 for the GRASS output map layer.

     armsed
          Output file:  Useful as input to r.grass.armsed.  ASCII
          file output that can be fed into the r.grass.armsed
          program to help calculate sedimentation yields and unit
          hydro-graphs.  As of 01/17/91, this option had not yet
          been fully tested.

NOTES
     There are two versions of this program: ram and seg.  Which
     is run by r.watershed depends on whether the -m flag is set.
     ram uses virtual memory managed by the operating system to
     store all the data structures and is faster than seg;  seg
     uses the GRASS segment library which manages data in disk
     files.  seg allows other processes to operate on the same
     CPU, even when the current geographic region is huge.  Due
     to memory requirements of both programs, it will be quite
     easy to run out of memory.  If ram runs out of memory and
     the resolution size of the current geographic region cannot
     be increased, either more memory  needs to be added to the
     computer, or the swap space size needs to be increased.  If
     seg runs out of memory, additional disk space needs to be
     freed up for the program to run.

     seg uses the AT least-cost search algorithm to determine the
     flow of water over the landscape (see SEE ALSO section).
     The algorithm produces results similar to those obtained
     when running r.cost and r.drain on every cell on the map.

     In many situations, the elevation data will be too finely
     detailed for the amount of time or memory available.
     Running r.watershed will require use of a coarser

     resolution.  To make the results more closely resemble the
     finer terrain data, create a map layer containing the lowest
     elevation values at the coarser resolution.  This is done
     by: 1) Setting the current geographic region equal to the
     elevation map layer, and 2) Using the neighborhood command
     to find the lowest value for an area equal in size to the
     desired resolution.  For example, if the resolution of the
     elevation data is 30 meters and the resolution of the
     geographic region for r.watershed will be 90 meters:  use
     the minimum function for a 3 by 3 neighborhood.  After going
     to the resolution at which r.watershed will be run,
     r.watershed will be taking values from the neighborhood
     output map layer that represents the minimum elevation
     within the region of the coarser cell.

     The minimum size of drainage basins is only relevant for
     those basins that have no basins draining into them (they
     are called exterior basins).  An interior drainage basin has
     the area that flows into an interior stream segment.  Thus,
     interior drainage basins can be of any size.

     The r.watershed program does not require the user to have
     the current geographic region filled with elevation values.
     Areas without elevation data MUST be masked out using the
     r.mask command.  Areas masked out will be treated as if they
     are off the edge of the region.  Masks will reduce the
     memory necessary to run the program.  Masking out
     unimportant areas can significantly reduce processing time
     if the watersheds of interest occupies a small percentage of
     the overall area.

     Zero data values will be treated as elevation data (not
     no_data).  If there are zero data along the edges of the
     current region, that edge will not be able to propagate
     negative accumulation data to the rest of the map.  This
     might give users a false sense of security about the quality
     of their data. If there are incomplete data in the elevation
     map layer, users should mask out those areas.
