NAME
     r.cross - Creates a cross product of the category values
     from multiple raster map layers.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.cross
     r.cross help
     r.cross [-qz] input=name,name[,name,...] output=name

DESCRIPTION
     r.cross creates an output raster map layer representing all
     unique combinations of category values in the raster input
     layers (input=name,name,name, ...).  At least two, but not
     more than ten, input map layers must be specified.	 The user
     must also specify a name to be assigned to the output raster
     map layer created by r.cross.

OPTIONS
     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies the names of between 2-10 raster map layers be
     used as input, and the name of a raster map layer to hold
     program output, using the form:

	  r.cross [-qz] input=name,name[,name,...] output=name

     where each input name specifies the name of a raster map
     layer to be used in calculating the cross product, the
     output name specifies the name of a raster map layer to hold
     program output, and the options -q and -z respectively
     specify that the program is to run quietly and exclude zero
     data values.

     Alternately, the user can simply type r.cross on the command
     line, without program arguments.  In this case, the user
     will be prompted for needed input and output map names and
     flag settings using the standard GRASS parser interface
     described in the manual entry for parser.

     Flags:

     -q		       Run quietly.  Supresses output of program
		       percent-complete messages.  If this flag
		       is not used, these messages are printed
		       out.

     -z		       Do not cross zero data values.  This means
		       that if a zero category value occurs in
		       any input data layer, the combination is
		       assigned to category zero in the resulting
		       map layer, even if other data layers
		       contain non-zero data.  In the example

		       given above, use of the -z option would
		       cause 3 categories to be generated instead
		       of 5.

		       If the -z flag is not specified, then map
		       layer combinations in which not all
		       category values are zero will be assigned
		       a unique category value in the resulting
		       map layer.


     Parameters:

     input=name,name[,name,...]
		       The names of between two and ten existing
		       raster map layers to be used as input.
		       Category values in the new output map
		       layer will be the cross-product of the
		       category values from these existing input
		       map layers.

     output=name       The name assigned to the new raster map
		       layer created by r.cross, containing
		       program output.









EXAMPLE
     For example, suppose that, using two raster map layers, the
     following combinations occur:

	  map1	 map2
	  ------------
	   0	  1
	   0	  2
	   1	  1
	   1	  2
	   2	  4



     r.cross would produce a new raster map layer with 5
     categories:

	  map1	 map2	output
	  ---------------------
	   0	  1	  1
	   0	  2	  2
	   1	  1	  3
	   1	  2	  4
	   2	  4	  5

     Note:  The actual category value assigned to a particular
     combination in the result map layer is dependent on the
     order in which the combinations occur in the input map layer
     data and can be considered essentially random.  The example
     given here is illustrative only.

SUPPORT FILES
     The category file created for the output raster map layer
     describes the combinations of input map layer category
     values which generated each category.  In the above example,
     the category labels would be:

	  category   category
	  value	     label
	  -------------------------------
	     1	     layer1(0) layer2(1)
	     2	     layer1(0) layer2(2)
	     3	     layer1(1) layer2(1)
	     4	     layer1(1) layer2(2)
	     5	     layer1(2) layer2(4)

     A random color table is also generated for the output map
     layer.

NOTES
     When run non-interactively, r.cross will not protect
     existing files in the user's mapset.  If the user specifies
     an output file name that already exists in his mapset, the
     existing file will be overwritten by the new r.cross output.
