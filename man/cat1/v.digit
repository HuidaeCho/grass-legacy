NAME
     v.digit - A menu-driven, highly interactive map development
     program used for vector digitizing, editing, labeling and
     converting vector data to raster format.
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.digit

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS program v.digit is a menu-driven, highly
     interactive map development program used for inputting
     analog map data into a GRASS vector format.  v.digit
     contains programs for vector digitizing, editing, labeling,
     windowing, and converting vector data to GRASS raster
     format.

     v.digit consists of two parts:  an initialization procedure,
     and a multiple menu-driven environment.
     1) The initialization procedure involves choosing a
     digitizer, choosing the name of a vector map layer to
     digitize, and, if needed, registering a map to the
     digitizing surface.
     2) The second part of v.digit is a multiple-menu environment
     in which digitizing, editing, labeling, and other options
     are available.  It is within this second portion of v.digit
     that all vector creation occurs.

NOTES
     The GRASS 4.1 version of v.digit has been upgraded so that
     it now no longer requires drivers to be written for each
     digitizer supported.  Instead we are using device
     independent code written originally by John Dabritz formerly
     of the Forest Service, which uses ascii description files to
     define how to communicate with the digitizer.  The result is
     that we should be able to support just about any digitizer
     out there now with a minimum of work.  Refer to the
     "digitizer definition manual" for information on the format
     of these files.

     v.digit was written to optimize digitizing speed and
     performance.  It has a convenient graphic display format and
     very convenient windowing capabilities.  Features are color-
     coded for ease of identification and verification.
     Different color schemes may be user-chosen to customize a
     digitizing session.

     Area, line, and point features may be digitized in both
     "stream" and "point" modes.  Both a mouse and a digitizer
     may be used to perform windowing functions.  Labeling and
     editing are done from within v.digit, rather than through a
     separate set of programs.

     v.digit has capabilities that allow users to convert vector
     map layers to GRASS raster format, to overlay already
     existing vector map layers onto the feature being digitized,
     and set a multitude of parameters to customize a digitizing
     session.

     v.digit may be used with or without a digitizer.  Many
     options are available if no digitizer is used.

     All options available within v.digit are contained within
     ten menus.	 Movement from menu to menu is done by chosing
     the movement options specified at the bottom of each menu.
