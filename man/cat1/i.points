NAME
     i.points - An imagery function that enables the user to mark
     coordinate system points on an image to be rectified and
     then input the coordinates of each point for creation of a
     coordinate transformation matrix.  The transformation matrix
     is needed as input for the GRASS program i.rectify.
     (GRASS Image Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     i.points

DESCRIPTION
     i.points is an imagery function that enables the user to
     mark points on a (raster) image to be rectified and then
     input the geographic coordinates of each point for
     calculation of a coordinate transformation matrix.  i.points
     must be followed by use of the GRASS program i.rectify,
     which rectifies the image using the transformation matrix
     coefficients calculated by i.points.

     Rectification is the mapping (transformation) of an image
     from one coordinate system to another.  The geometry of an
     image extracted into a GRASS LOCATION having an x,y
     coordinate system is not planimetric.  To create a
     planimetric image, that is, to convert the x,y coordinate
     system into a standard coordinate system (for example, the
     UTM coordinate system or the State Plane coordinate system),
     points from a map having the standard coordinates must be
     associated with the same points on the image to be
     rectified.  i.points enables the user to mark points on an
     image and input the standard coordinates for that point.
     i.points then calculates a least squares regression using
     the two coordinate systems (x,y and standard) for the marked
     points.  A matrix containing transformation coefficients is
     the output file for i.points.

     During the process of marking points and entering map
     coordinates, the user can compute the RMS (root mean square)
     error for each point entered.  i.points does this by
     calculating the transformation equation (the same one that
     is calculated in the GRASS program i.rectify), and then
     plugging these results into an equation for RMS error.

     i.points offers a zoom option to locate precisely the point
     to be marked on an image.  This program also offers the user
     the option of acquiring standard coordinates for a marked
     point from a map layer in the target data base.

     i.target must be run before running i.points to enable the
     PLOT RASTER option to be used and to identify a target data
     base LOCATION_NAME and MAPSET for the rectified image.  To
     run i.points, a graphics monitor is required.

     The procedure for marking points, entering coordinates, and
     calculating RMS error is described below.

     The first prompt in the program asks the user for the
     imagery group to be registered.  Note that if i.target is
     not run before i.points, the i.points program will display
     the following error message:

          ERROR: Target information for group [spot] missing
                 Please run i.target for group [spot]


     After entering the group to be registered the terminal
     screen displays the message:

                           Use mouse now...

     The graphics monitor displays the following screen:

     Any single raster map layer in the imagery group may be used
     on which to mark points, and the user can mark points on
     more than one raster map layer in the imagery group to
     accumulate the suggested minimum number of 12 points.  Any
     raster map layer in the imagery group can be rectified
     (using i.rectify) based on the transformation matrix
     computed from these points.

     The imagery file chosen by the user is displayed in the
     upper left quadrant of the screen.

ZOOM
     To magnify the displayed file, the user must place the mouse
     cross hairs on the word ZOOM.  The following menu will then
     be displayed at the bottom of the screen:


             ____________________________________________
            | Cancel|  Box|  Point|  Select type of ZOOM|
            |_______|_____|_______|_____________________|


     The user has the option of identifying the zoom region
     either by using the mouse to make a box, or by using the
     mouse to mark the two diagonal points of the desired region.
     The terminal screen will display a mouse button menu to
     guide the user in identifying the corner points of the
     region.

MARKING POINTS
     To mark the points on the image that correspond to the
     points on a standard coordinate system map, the user must
     place the mouse cross hairs on the corresponding location on
     the image to be marked and press the left hand button on the
     mouse.  A diamond shaped symbol will be marked on the image.

    | Enter coordinates as east north:                         |
    |__________________________________________________________|


     The user then enters the easting and northing (separated by
     a space) for the point marked on the image.  If the user
     wishes not to enter a coordinate, he or she may simply hit
     RETURN to return control to the mouse;  the marked point
     then disappears.

PLOT RASTER
     In addition to acquiring reference points from a standard
     map, the user has the option of acquiring the reference
     points from a raster map layer in the target data base
     LOCATION_NAME.  The data base raster map layer is displayed
     by placing the mouse cross hairs on the words PLOT RASTER.
     The following line is then displayed at the bottom of the
     graphics monitor:

     Which side of the graphics monitor is to be plotted is
     indicated by placing the mouse cross hairs on the half of
     the graphics monitor screen that the user would like to use,
     and pressing the left mouse button.  The following pop-down
     menu will be superimposed on the half of the screen that was

     After the raster map layer is displayed the following
     message appears at the bottom of the graphics monitor:


                ______________________________________
               | input method -->|  keyboard|  screen|
               |_________________|__________|________|


     If the user wishes to use the plotted raster map layer only
     as a comparative reference, then the keyboard can be chosen
     as the means to input coordinates corresponding to the
     marked points on the image.  This is done by placing the
     mouse cross hairs on the word KEYBOARD and pressing the left
     button on the mouse.

     If the user selects the SCREEN option, then points marked on
     the image will automatically be associated with the
     coordinates from the corresponding points on the target data
     base map layer.  In this option, when the user marks a point
     on the image, the following menu is displayed at the
     terminal:

     The user then uses the mouse to mark a corresponding point
     on the displayed image from the target data base.  The
     coordinates for the target data base map layer are
     automatically saved as the coordinates corresponding to the
     marked point on the image.

ANALYZE
     After a number of points have been marked (4 to 7), the user
     can check the RMS error of the points marked on the image.
     This is done by placing the mouse cross hairs on the word
     ANALYZE at the bottom of the graphics monitor.  An error
     report resembling that shown below is superimposed on the
     graphics monitor:

     The following menu then appears at the bottom of the
     graphics monitor:

|_____|____________|________________________________________________|


     The RMS error for the image is given under the column titled
     "error" and subtitled "row" and "col".  In the above report,
     point number 1 is 0.0 rows and -0.9 columns from the
     predicted location calculated from the transformation
     equation.  The RMS error for the target raster map layer is
     listed under the heading "target".  This is the RMS error
     for the east and north coordinates of the target map layer,
     but it is presented in the table using one general value.
     The overall RMS error is displayed at the bottom of the
     screen in meters.  Points that create high RMS error are
     displayed in red on the graphics monitor (represented here
     in italics).

     The location of the point marked on the imagery group file
     is given under the heading "image" and the subheadings
     "east" and "north".  The location of the point in the target
     data base is given under the heading "target" and the
     subheadings "east" and "north".  If the user would like to
     exclude or include a point, this can be accomplished by
     placing the mouse cross hairs on the point number to be
     included (if the point is absent) or excluded (if the point
     is displayed) and pressing the left button on the mouse
     twice.  When a point is excluded, it is not afterwards
     included in the calculation of the RMS error, or included in
     the final transformation matrix.  However, it can be
     retrieved within i.points at any time by double clicking
     with the mouse as described above.

QUIT
     To end the i.points program place the mouse cross hairs on
     the word QUIT;  the marked points (including coordinates)
     will be saved.

NOTES
     A good rule of thumb is to mark at least 12 to 15 points
     which are evenly distributed over the entire imagery group
     file in order to obtain an accurate transformation equation
     for the rectification process.  The RMS error may increase
     with more points added, but the transformation equation will
     be more accurate.

     An RMS error of less than or equal to approximately one
     resolution unit (pixel or cell) for the image being
     rectified is generally considered acceptable.

     In order to use a digitizer with i.points, at least one
     digitizer driver besides "none" (the on-screen digitizer)
