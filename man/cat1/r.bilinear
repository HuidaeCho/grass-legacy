NAME
     r.bilinear	- bilinear interpolation utility for raster map
     layers.

SYNOPSIS
     r.bilinear	[-q] input=name	output=name [north=value]
     [south=value]

DESCRIPTION
     r.bilinear	fills a	grid cell (raster) matrix with
     interpolated values generated from	a set of input layer data
     points.  It uses the bilinear interpolation method, a simple
     algorithm usually applied only to completely defined raster
     areas (input data void of null data values). Here the values
     of	4 input	cells are used to define an interpolation
     function of constant gradient within each rectangular area
     defined by	the cell centers. User should be aware that the
     gradient of the interpolation functions changes
     discontinuously across lines intersecting the cell	centers
     of	the input raster.

     If	there is a current working mask, it applies to the output
     raster file.  Only	those cells falling within the mask will
     be	assigned interpolated values.  The procedure for
     selection of input	data will consider all input data
     relevant to interpolating values at the cell centers of the
     current geographic	region,	ignoring the curent mask.  Zero
     values of the input raster	are assumed to be real values of
     a continuous variable, thus r.bilinear supports
     interpolation of variables	that range from	negative to
     positive values.  If input	zero values are	in fact	nulls,
     the user bears responsibility for controling the quality of
     the output, either	through	post-interpolation editing of the
     output or pre-interpolation setting of the	current	mask.
     Note that cells of	the output raster that cannot be bounded
     by	4 input	cell centers are set to	zero (null).

     The command line input is as follows:

     Flag:

     -q		       specifies that r.bilinear run quietly
		       (supressing the printing	of program
		       messages	to standard output)

     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of an input	raster map layer
		       containing data values to apply in the
		       interpolation.

     output=name       Name to be assigned to new output raster

		       map that	represents the surface generated
		       from the	data values in the input layer.

     north=value       Input raster value for the north	pole
		       (90N).  Valid for longitude-latitude grids
		       only.

     south=value       Input raster value for the south	pole
		       (90S).  Valid for longitude-latitude grids
		       only.

NOTES
     The north and south parameters have been included to allow
     for specific input	values to be assigned to the north and/or
     south poles for longitude-latitude	grids.	These data, if
     included, are used	to interpolate values for cells	that are
     north or south of a line intersecting the cell centers of
     the first or last row of input, respectively.  When
     utilized, the interpolation procedure will	be continuous
     from the north and/or south boundary of the current
     geographic	region.	 This option is	necessary, since the data
     structure defining	a raster will not allow	for data to be
     assigned to a cell	centered at 90N	or 90S.	 By including the
     option, the user can create output	surfaces that are
     continuous	between	the poles.  The	interpolation will be
     "wrap-around" from	west to	east (across latitude) only if
     the input raster has an east edge identical to its	west
     edge.

     For longitude-latitude databases, the interpolation
     algorithm is based	on degree fractions, not on the	absolute
     distances between cell centers.  Any attempt to implement
     the latter	would violate the integrity of the interpolation
     method.

     r.bilinear	may be used in some instances as an alternative
     to	the nearest neighbor approach inherent to r.resample.
     Note, however, that the extent of non-null	data area of the
     output raster must	be less	than that of the input raster.
     The only exception	to this	occurs in the case where the
     north and south parameters	are utilized for longitude-
     latitude rasters.
