NAME
     r.out.tiff (GRASS Raster Data Export Program)

GRASS VERSION
     4.x, 5.x (versions differ)

SYNOPSIS
     r.out.tiff [-ptv] input=name

DESCRIPTION
     This program converts a GRASS raster file to a TIFF raster
     file. Output may be 8 or 24 bit (TrueColor).  Optionally, a
     TIFF World file compatible with ESRI's and other's products
     may be output.

OPTIONS
Flags:
     TIFF Palette output (8bit instead of 24bit).  Output TIFF
     world file (output.tfw) Verbose mode.

Parameters:
     Name of an existing GRASS raster file to be exported.  Name
     of new TIFF image file.  Type of compression to use for TIFF
     file.

     Options: none, packbit, deflate

     Default: none The program prompts the user for the name of a
     GRASS raster file, an output TIFF file, whether an 8 or 24
     bit format is desired, and whether or not to create a TIFF
     world file.  Currently only uncompressed, packpit, or
     deflate TIFF files are written.  These output formats are
     known to be compatible with r.in.tiff.

     The user may adjust region and resolution before export
     using g.region.
