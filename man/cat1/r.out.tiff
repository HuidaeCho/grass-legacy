SYNOPSIS
     r.out.tiff [-pcv] input=name

DESCRIPTION
     This program converts a TIFF raster file (8bit) to a GRASS
     raster file.  Output is placed in the /cell directory under
     the user's current GRASS mapset.

OPTIONS
Flags:
     TIFF Palette output (8bit instead of 24bit).  Compress with
     LZW routine.  Verbose mode.

Parameters:
     Name of an existing GRASS raster file to be exported.  Name
     of new TIFF image file.  The program prompts the user to
     enter the name of the TIFF raster file to be converted and
     the name to be assigned to the GRASS raster file to contain
     the resultant image. Currently "TIFF/uncompressed",
     "TIFF/LZW-compression" and TIFF/PackBits-compression"
     formats are supported.

     The user may adjust region and resolution before export
     using g.region.
