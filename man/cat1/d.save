d.save <main>	      GRASS Reference Manual	    <main> d.save



NAME
     d.save - Creates a list of commands for recreating screen
     graphics.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.save
     d.save help
     d.save [-ca] [frame=name[,name,...]]

DESCRIPTION
     When GRASS display (d.) commands are used to generate
     graphical images on the graphics monitor, some commands are
     noted in lists that the current graphics driver (see manual
     entry for d.mon) maintains.  This command, d.save, uses this
     information to create a shell script that can be used to
     recreate graphics in another frame at another time.  The
     shell script is sent to standard output (the user's
     terminal).	 If you wish to save the shell script created by
     d.save, its output should be redirected to a file;	 for
     example:

	  d.save > script.out

     The user can run the program non-interactively by specifying
     flag settings and parameter values on the command line.  If
     the user types d.save without specifying these program
     arguments, the user will be prompted for inputs through the
     standard user interface described in the manual entry for
     parser.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flags:

     -c		       Shell script will contain only information
		       for regenerating graphics from the active
		       (current) frame.	 Use of this flag
		       overrides the frame option (below).

     -a		       Save information needed to regenerate all
		       the frames on the graphics monitor.  The
		       shell script can be used to completely
		       reconstruct the contents of the graphics
		       screen.

     Parameter:

     frame=name[,name,...]
		       Name(s) of those display frame(s) to be
		       saved.
		       Options:	 All available frames
		       Default:	 Active frame

     Display commands used interactively, and those that take
