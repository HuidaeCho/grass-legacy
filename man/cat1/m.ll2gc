NAME
     m.ll2gc - Converts geographic coordinates to geocentric
     coordinates.
     (GRASS Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.ll2gc lat=dd.mm.ss{n|s} lon=dd.mm.ss{e|w} [h=height]
     s=spheroid

DESCRIPTION
     m.ll2gc returns geocentric coordinates for geographic
     coordinates (latitude and longitude).  Geographic
     coordinates are in degrees, minutes, and seconds and must
     include designation of north or south {n|s} and east or west
     {e|w}.  The spheroid on which they are based must also be
     entered.  The height (in meters) above the spheroid is
     optional.

     The list of spheroids available is somewhat dynamic.  It may
     not contain exactly the ones listed below.  To determine the
     current list of possible spheroids, type in:

          m.ll2gc lat=0n lon=0w s=help

     A list of available spheroids will be printed on the screen.
     If the spheroid desired is not on the list, the values for
     the semi-major axis and the eccentricity squared for the
     spheroid may be entered in place of a spheroid name in the
     following format:

          s=a=semi-major_axis,e=eccentricity_squared

         The distances designated by "x," "y" and "z" are in
         meters from the center of the earth. Because the sample
         point is on the equator and is at 90 degrees west, two
         of the three parameters have a value of zero (i.e., the
         point is at the origin of those two dimensions).

NOTES
     For a brief discussion of spheroids see m.ll2u.

     Geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) describe the
     location of a point on the earth relative to the equator in
     the north/south directions and relative to Greenwich in the
     east/west directions.  The same point will have different
     coordinates depending on the spheroid used as the
     approximation of the shape of the earth.  The geocentric
     coordinates given here describe the point on the basis of
     the same spheroid, but they use the center of the spheroid
     as their origin.  This can be thought of as being the center
     of the earth, which is why they are called "geocentric."
     Describing the location of a point in a spheroid requires
     three points: x, y, and z;  these are measured out from the
     center along three different axes.  The distances given are
     in meters.

     This is an experimental program.  It is part of initial
     efforts to incorporate geographic coordinates into GRASS.
