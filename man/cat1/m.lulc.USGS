NAME
     m.lulc.USGS - Creates raster map layers from a Composite
     Theme Grid (CTG) file created by m.lulc.read.  m.lulc.read
     extracts the CTG data from an ASCII landuse/landcover (lulc)
     CTG format file supplied by the USGS.
     (GRASS Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.lulc.USGS input_file

DESCRIPTION
     m.lulc.USGS creates the following raster map layers from the
     CTG file created by m.lulc.read, and places them into the
     user's current mapset:

          1. Land Use & Land Cover
          2. Political Units
          3. Census Units
          4. Hydrologic Units
          5. Federal Land Ownership
          6. State Land Ownership

     Since the CTG file may not contain all of layers listed
     above, m.lulc.USGS will extract only the raster map layers
     which exist in the CTG file.

     The CTG file contains all of the geographic region
     definition information necessary for creating the raster map
     layers, including:

          1.  Grid Zone
          2.  Projection Type (UTM)
          3.  Cell Resolution (ew_res = nw_res)
          4.  Multi-byte data formation
          5.  Geographic region coordinates

     m.lulc.USGS will use the geographic region information
     definition supplied with the CTG file and NOT the geographic
     region definition currently set for the user's mapset; (note
     that this is different than is the case with many of the
     other GRASS map development commands).

     When m.lulc.USGS is executed, it will check the file for a
     specified layer and then ask the user if he wishes to
     extract the associated raster map layer.  The user is then
     prompted for the name of a new raster file in which output
     is to be placed.  m.lulc.USGS will then create this raster
     file and all supporting (e.g., category, cell header, color
     table, etc.) files.

EXAMPLE
     In the example below, raster data is extracted from a CTG

     file (named lulc) that contains only LAND USE/LAND COVER
     data:

         m.lulc.USGS lulc

         MAP TITLE: DODGE CITY, KS 1:250,000 LU, PB, CN, HU, FO
         The Composite Theme Grid file contains <1> overlays
         and has a map code type of <01>

         Do you Wish to Create <LAND USE/LAND COVER> Raster File (y/n) [y] y

         Enter File Name for LAND USE/LAND COVER Overlay
         Enter 'list' for a list of existing raster files
         Hit RETURN to cancel request
         > landuse

         Creating <landuse> from <LAND USE/LAND COVER> Overlay: 95%
         Number of Categories: 76  (UNLABELED)
         Writing Cell Header Information
         Writing Color Table Information

         Conversion is Complete

BUGS
     m.lulc.USGS does not currently extract Census unit data.
     Also, only the cataloging unit is extracted from the CTG
     file (see the Land Use and Land Cover Data User's Guide
     supplied by the USGS).
