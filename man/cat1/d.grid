NAME
     d.grid - Overlays a user-specified grid in the active
     display frame on the graphics monitor.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.grid
     d.grid help
     d.grid size=value [color=name] [origin=easting,northing]

DESCRIPTION
     d.grid overlays a grid of user-defined size and color in the
     active display frame on the graphics monitor.  The grid will
     overlay, not overwrite, the contents of the active display
     frame.

     d.grid can be run non-interactively or interactively.  If
     the user specifies the grid size and (optionally) the grid
     color on the command line the program will run non-
     interactively; if no grid color is given the default will be
     used.  Alternately, the user may simply type d.grid on the
     command line; in this case, the program will prompt the user
     for parameter values using the standard GRASS user interface
     described in the manual entry for parser.


     Parameters:

     size=value        Size of grid to be drawn in the active
                       display frame, in current map coordinate
                       system units.  It should be noted that,
                       depending on the scale of the map layer
                       displayed in this frame, the grid may fall
                       outside the user's viewing range.
                       Options:  0-100000

     color=name        Sets the current grid color to name.

     origin            Lines of the grid pass through this
                       coordinate.  The coordinate need not be
                       within the current frame.
                       Options:  red, orange, yellow, green,
                       blue, indigo, violet, magenta, brown,
                       gray, white, and black.
                       Default:  gray

NOTES
     d.grid will not erase grids already displayed in the active
     graphics display frame by previous invocations of d.grid;
     multiple invocations of d.grid will therefore result in the
     drawing of multiple grids inside the active graphics frame.
     (A command like d.erase, which erases the entire contents of

     the active display frame, must be run to erase previously
     drawn grids from the display frame.)

     Currently, the grid size can only be drawn in the units of
     the map coordinate system used by the current GRASS
     location.
