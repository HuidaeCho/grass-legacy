NAME
     r.distance - Locates the closest points between "objects" in
     two raster maps.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.distance
     r.distance help
     r.distance [-lq] maps=map1,map2 [fs=name]

DESCRIPTION
     Locates the closest points between "objects" in two raster
     maps.  An "object" is defined as all the grid cells that
     have the same category number, and closest means having the
     shortest "straight-line" distance.

     The output is an ascii list, one line per pair of objects

	 cat1:cat2:distance:east1:north1:east2:north2


     cat1 Category number from map1

     cat2 Category number from map2

     distance
	  The distance in meters between "cat1" and "cat2"

     east1,north1
	  The coordinates of the grid cell "cat1" which is
	  closest to "cat2"

     east2,north2
	  The coordinates of the grid cell "cat2" which is
	  closest to "cat1"


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flags

     -l	  include category labels in the output

     -q	  run quietly

     Parameters

     maps maps for computing inter-class distances

     fs	  output field separator
	  default is a colon (:)

NOTES
     The output format lends itself to filtering. For example to
     "see" lines connecting each of the category pairs in two
     maps, filter the output using awk and then into d.mapgraph:

	  r.distance maps=map1,map2 | \
	       awk -F':' '{print "move",$4,$5" draw",$6,$7}' | d.mapgraph

     To create a site list of all the "map1" coordinates, filter
     the output into awk and then into s.in.ascii:

	  r.distance maps=map1,map2 | \
	       awk -F: '{print $4,$5}' | s.in.ascii sites=name
