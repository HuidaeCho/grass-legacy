NAME
     s.menu - Accesses and manipulates GRASS site location data.
     (GRASS Sites Program)

SYNOPSIS
     s.menu

OVERVIEW
     The s.menu program provides the user with the capability of
     interfacing site location data with the geographic data in
     raster map layers.  Two types of spatial analysis reports on
     sites can be generated, and an interface to the "S"
     statistical package is provided.

DESCRIPTION
     The s.menu program is an interface to functions that allow
     the user to manipulate GRASS site "lists".  A site list is a
     list of eastings and northings describing the location of
     some point feature.  It can also contain a category value
     and category label for each site location.  The program is
     interactive.  After typing s.menu on the command line, the
     user selects site functions from a menu.

     The main menu is shown below:

        SITES MAIN MENU    (current list: no sites)

        LOCATION: spearfish    REGION 4928000.00(N)  4914000.00(S) 100.00 (RES)
        MAPSET:   PERMANENT            609000.00(E)   590000.00(W) 100.00 (RES)
        MASK:  none

        Please select one of the following

           1  Read an existing site list
           2  Mask current site list
           3  Save the current site list in your mapset

           4  Check site list for duplicate sites
           5  Edit site list using a UNIX editor

           6  Convert site list to raster file (0/1)
           7  Convert site list to raster file (frequency of occurrence)

           8  Run reports on the current site list


        stop  Leave the s.menu program

   At the top of the menu is general information about the user's
   current MAPSET, LOCATION, etc.  Note the above message in
   parentheses "current list:  no sites." This message will vary
   depending on the status of the list.  For example, after the

   user reads the existing site list file arch_sites, the message
   would read (given the geographic region indicated): "current
   list: 25 sites, 24 in current region."

s.menu               GRASS Reference Manual                s.menu



   1  Read an existing site list
      This option will copy an existing site list file into the
      current site list within the sites server.  Existing site
      lists are stored under a GRASS data base and are pulled
      into the s.menu server via this option.  Other sites menu
      functions operate only on the current site list file in the
      server -- you must therefore "read an existing site list"
      file BEFORE performing any of the other sites menu
      functions.
      Note:  Site lists can be created and placed into a GRASS
      data base using s.menu option 5 (edit) followed by option 3
      (save).  However, the user can also create site lists using
      other methods or programs.  One simple way to do this is to
      create a site list file in the appropriate format using any
      text editor (e.g., "vi"), and to put this site list file
      under the site_lists directory under the user's current
      GRASS mapset (i.e., under $LOCATION/site_lists).  The user
      can do this either inside of GRASS or outside of GRASS.
      Alternately, the user can run other GRASS programs which
      format their output as a GRASS site list file (r.random,
      s.db.rim, v.mkquads, v.to.sites), or the user can use UNIX
      programs like awk and sed to format other GRASS programs'
      output in the form of a site list file (d.what.rast,
      d.what.vect).

   2  Mask current site list
      The site list can be reduced to a subset that includes only
      sites which fall in specific categories within a specified
      raster map layer.  The user will be asked to specify the
      name of a raster map layer to form the basis for the mask,
      and will then be allowed to specify categories from this
      raster map that will limit the site list.  As with r.mask,
      the category values selected designate the areas of the map
      in which information will remain.  Areas assigned category
      values not selected will be re-assigned to category value
      "0" ("no data").
      Note:  This masking operation is performed only against the
      site list itself and not against other raster map layers.
      If the user wishes to analyze masked raster map layers, a
      mask should be create using the r.mask program.

   3  Save the current site list in your mapset
      The current site list can be stored permanently in your
      current mapset with this option.  You will be asked to name
      the saved site list and to provide a short description of
      it.  Saved site lists can be retrieved (option 1) during
      later runs of s.menu. Once saved, these site list files can
      be used with other GRASS programs, like d.sites, d.points,
      d.icons, p.icons, s.surf.idw, and s.db.rim.
      Note:  Saved lists will be removed if the GRASS mapset
      under which they are stored is removed.

   4  Check site list for duplicate sites
      It is not desirable that a site list contain multiple
      references to the same site.  This option attempts to
      recognize duplicate sites.  Duplicates are displayed to the
      user and can be removed automatically if the user desires.
      Duplicates can also be removed by hand using option 5
      (edit).

   5  Edit site list using a UNIX editor
      The user can modify the current site list or create a new
      site list by hand using a UNIX editor.  You will be asked
      to specify the text editor you prefer to use.  You should
      exercise some care if you select this option.  Lines in the
      site list which have invalid formats will be (silently)
      ignored by s.menu.  See the GRASS manual entry sites.format
      for a description of the site list format.
      Note:  This option will only modify the site list copied
      into the server.  It does not modify the original site list
      stored under a GRASS mapset.  If you wish to modify a
      stored site list file, you will have to combine options 1
      (read), 5 (edit) and 3 (save).

   6  Convert site list file to raster file (0/1)
      You can create a raster data representation of the site
      list in your GRASS mapset.
      Once created, this raster map layer can be used with other
      raster map layers in further analyses.  Allowing the user
      to create a raster map layer of sites opens up the full
      analysis capabilities for site data that are available for
      raster map layers within GRASS.
      You have the option of specifying the number of cells to
      represent a site.  The minimum is one cell per site.  The
      alternatives are squares around the site:  3x3, 5x5, 7x7,
      etc.
      The number of categories present in the new raster map
      layers will depend on the format of your site list file
      (see sites.format).  You can create a non-binary raster map
      layer representation of your site list by creating the site
      list in the format:
        E|N| #n label
      where E is the Easting, N is the Northing, and #n label is
      the description field.  The description field consists of a
      pound sign # followed by the category value n to be
      associated with the site's cell location, and the category
      label label for n.
      If the user does not include a description field starting
      with
        #n
      beside the Easting and Northing on every line in the sites
      list file, a binary raster map layer will be created
      instead.  In the binary raster file, each site will be
      represented as the category value 1.  Non-site cells will

s.menu               GRASS Reference Manual                s.menu



      be coded as category value 0.

      Note that only sites within the current geographic region
      will be considered.  However, if the size of the sites is
      more than one cell ( 3x3, 5x5, etc.) and a site lies near
      an edge of the geographic region, some of the cells for the
      site may fall outside the geographic region.  These cells
      will not appear in the raster map layer, and the site will
      no longer be 3x3 or 5x5 but will be clipped to fit the
      geographic region.

   7  Convert site list file to raster file (frequency of
   occurrence)
      You can also create a frequency of occurrence raster map
      layer representation of the site list file.
      The raster category values will be coded as the number of
      sites that fall within the cell.
      In this function, you do NOT have the option of specifying
      the number of cells to represent a site.

   8  Run reports on the current site list
      The current list of sites is passed to the report server
      after removing sites which do not fall within the
      geographic region of the user's current GRASS mapset (see
      g.region).  The user then selects the names of one or more
      raster map layers for analysis.  Data at (or near) the
      sites extracted from these raster map layers form the basis
      for all reports.
      The user specifies the 'size' of a site in cells.  The
      'size' may be specified as a single cell, or as a 3x3
      square around the site, or 5x5, or 7x7, etc (where the size
      is an odd integer).


   The following menu of reports is then presented:

        SITES REPORT MENU


        Please select one of the following

           1  Site characteristics report
           2  Site occurrence report

           3  Convert data to S input format
           4  Produce machine-readable data file

        stop  return to SITES MAIN MENU

   1  Site characteristics report
      This report provides geographic information about each
      site.



GRASS 4.0                U.S. Army CERL                         5






s.menu               GRASS Reference Manual                s.menu



      Each site is identified by description and locational
      information.  The 'description' is an identification of the
      site.  The site location is an easting and a northing.
      (The location does not denote the extent of the site,
      since, for example, an archeologic site which takes up two
      hectares would be represented as a single point).
      The information reported for each site is displayed by
      raster map layer, and, within each map layer, gives the
      categories (i.e., characteristics) that occurred at the
      site (as well as a count of the number of cells in each
      category).
      This can easily generate a massive amount of information,
      which is difficult to handle or digest quickly.  Therefore,
      option 2 produces a synopsis of the information.

   2  Site occurrence report
      This report provides aggregate site characteristic
      information organized by raster map layer.  The report
      produces chi-square statistics for each raster map layer,
      measuring number of expected sites (assuming a random
      distribution of sites) against actual site occurrence.  The
      site characteristic is the most frequently occurring cell
      category in the site (i.e., the statistical mode).  See the
      GRASS manual entry for sites.occur for details on this
      report.

   3  Convert data to S input format
      This function converts the GRASS data extracted for the
      sites into a form usable by the S statistical package.  The
      user provides a file to contain the information.  Once the
      file is written, the user must exit s.menu, run S on an S
      data base, and issue the S command

      source file

      to bring the data into the S data base.  (Of course, file
      would be the name of the actual file supplied by the user.)
      See manual entry sites.S for an explanation of the S data
      structures created by this interface.

   4  Produce machine-readable data file
      This option provides a mechanism for the user to write
      his/her own reports.  The data is written into a user-
      specified file as a text file, which has a format readable
      by UNIX utilities (e.g., awk) or user-written programs.
      See GRASS manual entry sites.report for details on this
      format.
