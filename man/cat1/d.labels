NAME
     d.labels - To create/edit GRASS paint label files for
     display on the graphics monitor.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.labels

DESCRIPTION
     The d.labels program allows the user to interactively create
     and modify paint-labels files for use with the p.map and
     d.paint.labels programs.  The paint labels files created
     will be stored in the user's current mapset under the
     /paint/labels directory.

     d.labels is fully interactive, and requires use of a
     graphics monitor.  After the user has typed

          d.labels

     and has typed in the name of a new or existing paint-labels
     file, the user is asked to indicate label positions on the
     display frame using the mouse-pointer, and to edit label
     parameters that define the label's size, color, and other
     characteristics through use of a visual-ask (VASK) data
     entry screen.  The mouse can also be used to indicate the
     geographic coordinates of locations within the current
     geographic region in the active frame.  It is helpful to
     display a relevant data file in the active display frame
     before running d.labels to provide visual clues for label
     placement.

USER PROMPTS
     You will first be prompted to enter the name of either an
     old paint-labels file that you wish to modify, or a new
     paint-labels file that you wish to create.  The following is
     the file name prompt:

          Enter the name of an existing labels file
          Enter list for a list of existing labels files
          Hit RETURN to cancel request
          >


     If you enter the name of a new (non-existent) paint-labels
     file, you are asked to indicate a location falling within
     the current geographic region in the active display frame at
     which the label is to be placed.

     Once you have indicated a position, you will be presented
     with a data-entry screen (also known as a VASK screen) so
     that you can enter the paint-label parameters that define
     how the label will appear on the display or on the color
     printer.  Once you finish entering the label-parameters, and
     you hit the <ESC> key to proceed, the label will be
     displayed on the screen.  If you like the appearance of the
     label, enter "y" to the "Look OK?" prompt;  if not, enter
     "n" and you will again be presented with the data entry
     screen.  Once you approve the label's appearance you will be
     asked to indicate the position of the next label.

     If you choose to display an already-existing paint-labels
     file, you will be shown the labels in that file one at a
     time.  For each label, you will be asked:  "Look OK?" If you
     answer "n" to the "Look OK?" prompt, you will be presented
     with the data entry screen so that you may modify the
     appearance of the label to your liking.

     On-line help is available.  If you are puzzled about what
     should go in a data entry field, just enter "help" in that
     field, hit the <ESC> key, and you will be presented with a
     short description of the field and what you may enter.

     The following is a list of the different fields in the data
     entry screen and a short description of each.

          TEXT: The user can enter up to four lines of text.

          SKIP: yes/no.  If no, label will be printed.  If yes,
          the label will be retained in the file but not printed.

          LOCATION: Determines where the text will be located.
          The user specifies the easting and northing in map
          units, and (optionally) specifies a vertical and
          horizontal offset (in printer pixels) from the
          specified easting/northing.  (The vertical (y) offset
          will shift the location to the south if positive, north
          if negative.  The horizontal (x) offset will shift the
          location east if positive, west if negative.)  These
          offsets are provided to allow finer placement of
          labels.

          RESET LOCATION: yes/no.  If yes, the user will be
          allowed to use the mouse to select a new location for
          the label.  The mouse buttons will function as follows:

                Right:   Quit

          PLACEMENT: Determines which part of the label to which
          the location refers.  This may be specified as:

                    lower left     (lower left corner of the text)
                    lower right    (lower right corner of the text)
                    lower center   (bottom center of the text)

                    upper left     (upper left corner of the text)
                    upper right    (upper right corner of the text)
                    upper center   (top center of the text)

                    center    (center of the text)

          TEXT SIZE: Determines the size of the lettering used in
          the label.  Text size (height) is stated in units of
          (ground) meters; e.g., a text size of 500 sets the
          height of each line of text equal to 500 ground meters.
          Thus, text will appear to grow or shrink when
          displayed, depending on the user's current geographic
          region settings.

          TEXT COLOR: This selects the text color.  This color
          can be specified in one of three ways:

          1) By color name:
             aqua black blue brown cyan gray green grey indigo
             magenta orange purple red violet white yellow

          2) As red, green, blue percentages.  For example: .5 .4
             .7
             (This form is not supported by d.paint.labels, but
             see p.map and p.labels.)

          3) By printer color number, to get the exact printer
             color.
             (This form is not supported by d.paint.labels, but
             see p.map and p.labels.)

             Note.  If the user sets the text color equal to the
             background color, the text will not appear on the
             graphics monitor.

             WIDTH: This determines the line thickness of the
             letters.  The normal text width should be set to 1.
             Larger numbers can be used to simulate bold face.
             (d.paint.labels ignores this value and always uses
             1.)

             HIGHLIGHT COLOR: The text can be highlighted in
             another color so that it appears to be in two

d.labels             GRASS Reference Manual              d.labels



             colors.  The text is drawn first in this color at a
             wider line width, and then redrawn in the text color
             at the regular line width.  Highlight colors are not
             shown on the graphics display, they are only shown
             in the output from p.labels and p.map.

             HIGHLIGHT WIDTH: Specifies how far from the text
             lines (in pixels) the highlight color should extend.
             Highlight colors are not shown on the graphics
             display, they are only shown in the output from
             p.labels and p.map.

             BACKGROUND COLOR: Text may be boxed in a solid color
             by specifying a background color (see TEXT COLOR
             above to specify a color).  Specify none to use no
             background.

             OPAQUE TO VECTORS: yes/no.  This field only has
             meaning if a background color is selected.  yes will
             prevent vector lines from entering the background.
             no will allow vector lines to enter the background.

             BORDER COLOR: Select a color for the border around
             the background.  Specify none to suppress the
             border.


NOTES
     This program is fully interactive and requires no command
     line arguments.

     If the user types the word help in a data entry field while
     entering label information, acceptable field choices will be
     listed.

     Labels must be placed within the current geographic region.
     If the user attempts to place a label outside of this
     region, the program will appear to loop endlessly.  It is
     simply failing to display a label positioned beyond the
     boundaries of the current region; in this event, the user
     should simply reposition the label.


     Labels created by this program are stored in ASCII files
     under the directory $LOCATION/paint/labels.
