NAME
     m.in.pl94.db3 - Import Demographic	records	from Census
     PL94-171 dBase3 (CDROM) Files
     (GRASS Sites Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.in.pl94.db3 help
     m.in.pl94.db3 [-f]	[-p] [-n] sc=string [ sc=str . . ]
     in=/cdrom/pl9417ss.dbf > result_file
     This command may be run in	command	line mode only.
     Parameters	used must be in	the order specified.


PARAMETERS
	   -f	       Output to stdout	the list of all	field name and starting	positions
		       for the Identification Section of the PL94 file.	 Other
		       parameters are not necessary and	will be	ignored.

	   -p	       Print several information items to stderr input
		       file is opened.

	   -n	       Output only the sequential number and PL94 logical record
		       number (LOGRECNU) of matching records to	stdout.

	   sc=string   sc is starting column or	a capitilized reference	name from
		       the Identification Section of the PL94 Data Dictionary;
		       string is characters to match there.  A negative	test may
		       also be made with: sc!=string.  If more than one	test is
		       specified the results are "anded" resulting in a
		 conjunction of	the results of the expressions.	 (See
		 m.in.stf1.tpe for complete details.)

	   in	       Path/file for dBase files for state ss.

DESCRIPTION
     This program is provided to read the Census PL94 data
     records from a file for one state.	 The file is usually on	a
     CD-ROM, but this is not necessary providing the proper path
     is	given for the in= parameter and	the contents of	the file
     duplicate that on CD-ROM.

     The output	consists of records of 517 characters extracted
     from the input file with a	suitable line termination
     character added (0	to create a normal text	file.

     Users of GRASS 4.1	and the	Census PL94 files on CD-ROM will
     generally use this	program	to select appropriate subsets of
     PL94 records; write them to one or	more files; and	then
     either process these files	directly with v.apply.census to
     print demographics, create	site maps or label vector maps,
     or	use m.in.stf1.tpe to extract further subsets.

     The PL94 CD-ROM data file for most	states is very large,
     100+ MB.  This program may	take 20	to 60 minutes for a
     single extraction,	so plan	carefully and don't discard
     useful subsets that you create on disk.


EXAMPLES
     Insert the	appropriate CD-ROM and mount it	(see your system
     administrator).  (We assume here that it is mounted as the
     file system /cdrom.)

     To	extract	all Census tract summary records for the state of
     South Dakota:

     m.in.pl94.db3 -p 11=050 in=/cdrom/pl9417sd.dbf > counties.sd

     The 11=050	parameter selects those	records	which have the
     character string Summary Level (SUMLEV) field which is used
     in	almost every selection from CD-ROM.

     To	extract	all block records for Lawrence County, South
     Dakota:

     m.in.pl94.db3 -p SUMLEV=100 CNTY=081 in=/cdrom/pl9417sd.dbf
     >

     100 is the	SUMLEV for blocks and 081 is the county	code for
     Lawrence Co.


SEE ALSO
     m.in.stf1.tpe is used as a	post-processor to select further
     subsets of	PL94 records.  NOTE: Unix utility programs, such
     as	grep or	awk, can also be used for the for processing the
     extracted PL94 files.
