NAME
     r.le.patch (GRASS Raster Program)

GRASS VERSION
     4.x

SYNOPSIS
     r.le.patch

     r.le.patch help

     r.le.patch [-bcnptu] map=name]

OPTIONS
Flags:
     Run in background.	 Output map 'interior' with patch cores.
     Output map 'num' with patch numbers.  Include sampling area
     boundary as perimeter.  Use 4 neighbor tracing instead of 8
     neighbor.	Output maps 'units_x' with sampling units for
     each scale x.

Parameters:
     Raster map to be analyzed.	 Sampling method (choose only 1
     method): w=whole map, u=units, m=moving window, r=regions
     Default: w Name of regions map, only when sam = r; omit
     otherwise.	 Attribute measures: Options: a1, a2, a3, a4, a5,
     a6, a7 a1 = mean pixel attribute a2 = st. dev. pixel
     attribute a3 = mean patch attribute a4 = st. dev. patch
     attribute a5 = cover by gp a6 = density by gp a7 = total
     density Patch size measures: Options: s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6
     s1 = mean patch size s2 = st. dev. patch size s3 = mean
     patch size by gp s4 = st. dev. patch size by gp s5 = no. by
     size class s6 = no. by size class by gp Edge width in pixels
     (integer) for use with co2 Core size measures (required if
     co1 was specified): Options: c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7, c8,
     c9, c10 c1 = mean core size c2 = st. dev. core size c3 =
     mean edge size c4 = st. dev. edge size c5 = mean core size
     by gp c6 = st. dev. core size by gp c7 = mean edge size by
     gp c8 = st. dev. edge size by gp c9 = no. by size class c10
     = no. by size class by gp Shape method (choose only 1
     method): m1 = perim./area m2 = corr. perim./area m3 = rel.
     circum. circle Shape measures (required if sh1 was
     specified): Options: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 h1 = mean patch
     shape h2 = st. dev. patch shape h3 = mean patch shape by gp
     h4 = st. dev. patch shape by gp h5 = no. by shape class h6 =
     no. by shape class by gp Fractal dimension measures:
     Options: f1 f1 = perim.-area fractal dim.	Perimeter
     measures (required if pe1 was specified): Options: p1, p2,
     p3, p4, p5, p6 p1 = sum of perims.	 p2 = mean perim.  p3 =
     st. dev. perim.  p4 = sum of perims. by gp p5 = mean perim.
     by gp p6 = st. dev. perim. by gp Name of output file for
     individual patch measures, when sam=w, u, r; if out=head,
