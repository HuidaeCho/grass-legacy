NAME
     m.dted.examine - Provides a terse description of level 1 and
     2 digital terrain elevation data (DTED) files produced and
     distributed by the Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) on 1/2-inch
     magnetic tapes.
     (GRASS Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.dted.examine [tapedev]

DESCRIPTION
     m.dted.examine scans digital terrain elevation data (DTED -
     Levels 1 and 2) that was produced and supplied by the
     Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) on 1/2-inch magnetic tape from
     the tape device specified by tapedev, and prints to the
     screen a terse description of each file.

     If the user specifies no tapedev on the command line the
     program assumes that input is coming from /dev/rmt0.  The
     information provided by m.dted.examine includes the UTM
     borders, cell resolution, and number of elevation profiles
     in each file.

BUGS
     The header file for DTED Level 1 and 2 data was changed in
     1987.  m.dted.examine and m.dted.extract operate only on
     DTED data containing pre-1987 headers.  DTED data containing
     the pre-1987 headers may be purchased from the Defense
     Mapping Agency (DMA) upon request.
