NAME
     v.in.tig.rim - Imports Census Bureau line data (TIGER files)
     to	GRASS vector format.
     (GRASS Vector Data	Import Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.in.tig.rim
     v.in.tig.rim help
     v.in.tig.rim dbname=name in1file=name in2file=name
     zone=value

DESCRIPTION
     v.in.tig.rim imports Census line data (called TIGER) and
     creates a "master"	binary vector file containing a	large
     amount of data.  Various map layers can then be created by
     querying information from the master vector file using
     v.db.rim or one of	the Gen. shell scripts listed in the SEE
     ALSO section, below.  The database	name (dbname) given on
     the command line will be the name of the rim data base, and
     the master	vector file in GRASS will be named
     "dbname.Master".  The master vector file will include all
     information from the type1	and type2 TIGER	files given on
     the command line as in1file and in2file.  If the user simply
     types v.in.tig.rim	on the command line, all parameters will
     be	queried	using the standard GRASS parser	described in the
     manual entry for parser.

COMMAND	LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     dbname=name       Vector/rim data name (with a maximum of 7
		       characters).

     in1file=name      TIGER type1 input file name.

     in2file=name      TIGER type2 input file name.

     zone=value	       Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone
		       in which	these data are located.
		       Options:	 -60 - 60

NOTES
     TIGER data	are presented in latitude/longitude format, and
     are converted to UTM (Universal Transverse	Mercator)
     coordinates as part of this importing routine.  The spheroid
     used in the conversion is clark 66, as it is the most
     consistent	with the original data.

     This command must be compiled separately, and requires the
     use of rim	and v.db.rim which contain FORTRAN code.  The
     user must have access to a	FORTRAN	compiler in order to
     compile and use this command, since it calls both rim and

     v.db.rim.

     If	the user does not know the UTM zone for	this data input
     file, the command m.tiger.region should be	run first to
     determine the zone.

     v.support must be run separately on the output file if
     needed.
