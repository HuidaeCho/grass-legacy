NAME
     g.mapsets - Modifies the user's current mapset search path,
     affecting the user's access to data existing under the other
     GRASS mapsets in the current location.
     (GRASS File Management Program)

SYNOPSIS
     g.mapsets
     g.mapsets help
     g.mapsets [-lp] [mapset=name[,name,...]]

DESCRIPTION
     A mapset holds a distinct set of data layers, each relevant
     to the same (or a subset of the same) geographic region, and
     each drawn in the same map coordinate system.  At the outset
     of every GRASS session, the user identifies a GRASS data
     base, location, and mapset that are to be the user's current
     data base, current location, and current mapset for the
     duration of the session; any maps created by the user during
     the session will be stored under the current mapset
     ($MAPSET) set at the session's outset.

     The user can add, modify, and delete data layers that exist
     under his current mapset.  Although the user can also access
     (i.e., use) data that are stored under other mapsets in the
     same GRASS location, the user can only make permanent
     changes (create or modify data) located in the current
     mapset.  The user's mapset search path lists the order in
     which other mapsets in the same GRASS location can be
     searched and their data accessed by the user.  The user can
     modify the listing and order in which these mapsets are
     accessed by modifying the mapset search path; this can be
     done using the g.mapsets command.  This program allows the
     user to use other's relevant map data without altering the
     original data layer, and without taking up disk space with a
     copy of the original map.

     g.mapsets shows the user available mapsets under the current
     GRASS location, lists mapsets to which the user currently
     has access, and lists the order in which accessible mapsets
     will be accessed by GRASS programs searching for data files.
     The user is then given the opportunity to add or delete
     mapset names from his search path, or modify the order in
     which mapsets will be accessed.

     When the user specifies the name of a data base element file
     (e.g., a particular vector file, raster file, imagery group
     file, etc.) to a GRASS program, the program searches for the
     named file under each of the mapsets listed in the user's
     mapset search path in the order listed there until the
     program finds a file of the given name.  (Users can also
     specify a file by its mapset, to make explicit the mapset

     from which the file is to be drawn;  e.g., the command:

          g.copy rast='soils.file@PERMANENT',my.soils

     ensures that a new file named my.soils is to be a copy of
     the file soils.file from the mapset PERMANENT.)

     It is common for a user to have the special mapset PERMANENT
     included in his mapset search path, as this mapset typically
     contains finished base maps relevant to many applications.
     Often, other mapsets which contain sets of interpreted map
     layers will be likewise included in the user's mapset search
     path.  Suppose, for example, that the mapset Soil_Maps
     contains interpreted soils map layers to which the user
     wants access.  The mapset Soil_Maps should then be included
     in the user's search path variable.

     The mapset search path is saved as part of the current
     mapset.  When the user works with that mapset in subsequent
     GRASS sessions, the previously saved mapset search path will
     be used (and will continue to be used until it is modified
     by the user with g.mapsets).

     Flags:

     -l                List all available mapsets under the
                       user's current location.

     -p                Print the user's current mapset search
                       path to standard output.


     Parameter:

     mapset=name[,name,...]   Name(s) of existing GRASS mapset(s)
                              under the current location.

     g.mapsets sets the current mapset search path to the mapsets
     named on the command line.  If g.mapsets is typed but no
     mapset names are specified by the user on the command line,
     the program will print the user's current mapset search
     path, list available mapsets, and prompt the user for a new
     mapset search path listing.

NOTES
     Users can restrict others' access to their mapset files
     through use of the GRASS program g.access.  Mapsets to which
     access is restricted can still be listed in another's mapset
     search path; however, access to these mapsets will remain
     restricted.
