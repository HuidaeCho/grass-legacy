     _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h draws graphics that are described in standard
     input (default) or the UNIX input file _n_a_m_e.  If commands
     are entered via standard input, a _c_t_r_l_-_d is used to signal
     the end of input to _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h.  This program performs
     essentially the same function as _d_._g_r_a_p_h; however, point
     locations are specified to _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h in the geographic
     coordinate system of the user's current mapset and location
     (i.e., in map coordinates), rather than in graphics display
     screen coordinates.

     The program can be run interactively or non-interactively.
     The user can run the program completely non-interactively by
     specifying the name of a file containing _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h graphics
     commands and the values of all needed parameters on the
     command line.  The user can instead elect to run the program
     partially interactively, by specifying any/all of the
     parameters _e_x_c_e_p_t the graphics input=_n_a_m_e parameter on the
     command line.  In this case, _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h will expect the user
     to input _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h graphics commands from standard input
     (i.e., the keyboard) and will (silently) prompt the user for
     these graphics commands.  Alternately, the user can simply
     type dd..mmaappggrraapphh on the command line, and be prompted for the
     values of all parameters (the user can still input graphics
     commands from an input file using this form.)  In this case,
     the user is presented with the standard GRASS parser
     interface described in the manual entry for _p_a_r_s_e_r.

     _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h is used for drawing simple graphics on top of map
     layers.  The coordinate system used by _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h is the
     same as that of the map layer displayed in the active
     display frame on the graphics monitor (or that of the user's
     current region, if no map is displayed).

     The graphics language is simple and uses the following
     commands:

     ## _c_o_m_m_e_n_t
          A line of comment which is ignored in the processing.
     mmoovvee _x_p_o_s _y_p_o_s
          The current location is updated to _x_p_o_s _y_p_o_s (where
          these, respectively, are the easting and northing of
          geographic coordinates stated in the map coordinate
          system of the user's current GRASS location, falling
          within the current region and active frame).  If
          unspecified by the user, the current location becomes
          (0,0).  If, as most likely, the point (0,0) falls
          outside of the user's current region, graphics drawn
          there will not appear in the graphics frame.
          Note:  use _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n to obtain the coordinates of
          current location.  Use _d_._w_h_e_r_e to obtain specific map
          coordinates of various points on the raster map
          displayed in the active frame.
          Note:  there must be a space between _x_p_o_s and _y_p_o_s.
     ddrraaww _x_p_o_s _y_p_o_s
          A line is drawn in the current color from the current
          location to the new location _x_p_o_s _y_p_o_s, which then
          becomes the current location.  _x_p_o_s and _y_p_o_s are
          (respectively) an easting and northing stated in the
          map coordinate system of the user's current GRASS
          location, and located within the user's current
          geographic region and active frame.
          Note:  there must be a space between _x_p_o_s and _y_p_o_s.
     ccoolloorr _c_o_l_o_r
          Sets the current color to that stated.  Color options
          are: _r_e_d_, _o_r_a_n_g_e_, _y_e_l_l_o_w_, _g_r_e_e_n_, _b_l_u_e_, _i_n_d_i_g_o_, _v_i_o_l_e_t_,
          _m_a_g_e_n_t_a_, _b_r_o_w_n_, _g_r_a_y_, _w_h_i_t_e, and _b_l_a_c_k.
     ssiizzee _x_p_e_r _y_p_e_r
          Subsequent text will be drawn such that the text is
          _x_p_e_r percent of the display frame's width and _y_p_e_r
          percent of the display frame height.  If not specified
          by the user, the text size becomes 5 percent of the
          active frame's width and 5 percent of the frame's
          height.  This is equivalent to entering ssiizzee 55 55.
     tteexxtt _l_i_n_e_-_o_f_-_t_e_x_t
          The stated text is drawn at the current location using
          the current color and the current size.
     iiccoonn _t_y_p_e _s_i_z_e _x _y
          Draws an icon of types o, x, or + with specified size
          at location x,y.  Note:  type o designates a square.

     _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h is identical to the _d_._g_r_a_p_h command, except for
     the difference in coordinate systems used.
     _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h will complain if the user enters something to
     standard input that it does not understand.  Blank lines in
     the input file will result in this error message.
