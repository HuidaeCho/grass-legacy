NAME
     r.reclass - Creates a new map layer whose category values
     are based upon the user's reclassification of categories in
     an existing raster map layer.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.reclass
     r.reclass help
     r.reclass input=name output=name [title=name]

DESCRIPTION
     r.reclass creates an output map layer based on an input
     raster map layer.	The output map layer will be a
     reclassification of the input map layer based on reclass
     rules input to r.reclass, and can be treated in much the
     same way that raster files are treated.  A title for the
     output map layer may be (optionally) specified by the user.

     The reclass rules are read from standard input (i.e., from
     the keyboard, redirected from a file, or piped through
     another program).

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies the name of the raster map layer to be
     reclassified, the name of an output layer to hold reclass
     rules, and (optionally) the name of a title for the output
     map:

	  r.reclass input=name output=name [title=name]

     After the user types in the above information on the command
     line, the program will (silently) prompt the user for
     reclass rules to be applied to the input map layer
     categories.  The form of these rules is described in further
     detail in the sections on non-interactive program use
     reclass rules and examples, below.

     Alternately, the user can simply type r.reclass on the
     command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the
     user will be prompted for all needed inputs.

     Before using r.reclass one must know the following:

     1	  The new categories desired;  and, which old categories
	  fit into which new categories.

     2	  The names of the new categories.

INTERACTIVE PROGRAM USE: EXAMPLE
     Suppose we want to reclassify the raster map layer roads,
     consisting of five categories, into the three new

     categories: paved roads, unpaved roads, and railroad tracks.
     The user is asked whether the reclass table is to be
     established with each category value initially set to 0, or
     with each category value initially set to its own value.  A
     screen like that shown below then appears, listing the
     categories of the roads raster map layer to be reclassified
     and prompting the user for the new category values to be
     assigned them.

     In the following screen the new category values have been
     entered beside the appropriate old category names.	 Cells
     assigned category values 2, 3, and 4 in the old raster map
     layer are now assigned the new category value 2 in the
     reclassed map; cell data formerly assigned to category value
     5 in the old raster map map are now assigned the new
     category value 3 in the reclassed map.

		       (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)



     Hitting the escape key <ESC> will bring up the following
     screen, which prompts the user to enter a new title and
     category label for the newly reclassed categories.

     Based upon the information supplied by the user in the above
     sample screens, the new output map, supporting category,
     color, history, and header files are created.

NON-INTERACTIVE PROGRAM USE: RECLASS RULES
     In non-interactive program use, the names of an input map,
     output map, and output map title are given on the command
     line.  However, the reclass rules are still read from
     standard input (i.e., from the keyboard, redirected from a
     file, or piped through another program).

     Once the user has specified an input raster map layer,
     output map layer name, and (optionally) output map layer
     title by typing

	  r.reclass input=name output=name [title=name]

     Each line of input must have the following format:

	  input_categories=output_category  [label]

     where the input lines specify the category values in the
     input raster map layer to be reclassified to the new
     output_category category value.  Specification of a label to
     be associated with the new output map layer category is
     optional.	If specified, it is recorded as the category
     label for the new category value.	The equal sign = is
     required.	The input_category(ies) may consist of single
     category values or a range of such values in the format "low
     thru high."  The word "thru" must be present.

     A line containing only the word end terminates the input.

NON-INTERACTIVE PROGRAM USE: EXAMPLES
     The following examples may help clarify the reclass rules.


     1	This example reclassifies categories 1, 3 and 5 in the



GRASS 5.0beta2	      GRASS Development Team			3






r.reclass <main>      GRASS Reference Manual	 <main> r.reclass



	input raster map layer to category 1 with category label
	"poor quality" in the output map layer, and reclassifies
	input raster map layer categories 2, 4, and 6 to category
	2 with the label "good quality" in the output map layer.

	     1 3 5   =	 1   poor quality
	     2 4 6   =	 2   good quality


     2	This example reclassifies input raster map layer
	categories 1 thru 10 to output map layer category 1,
	input map layer categories 11 thru 20 to output map layer
	category 2, and input map layer categories 21 thru 30 to
	output map layer category 3, all without labels.

	      1 thru 10	  =   1
	     11 thru 20	  =   2
	     21 thru 30	  =   3


     3	Subsequent rules override previous rules.  Therefore, the
	below example reclassifies input raster map layer
	categories 1 thru 19 and 51 thru 100 to category 1 in the
	output map layer, input raster map layer categories 20
	thru 24 and 26 thru 50 to the output map layer category
	2, and input raster map layer category 25 to the output
	category 3.

	     1 thru 100	  =   1	  poor quality
	     20 thru 50	  =   2	  medium quality
		 25	  =   3	  good quality


     4	The previous example could also have been entered as:

	      1 thru 19	 51 thru 100   =   1   poor quality
	     20 thru 24	 26 thru 50    =   2   medium quality
		       25	       =   3   good quality

	or as:

	      1 thru 19	   =   1   poor quality
	     51 thru 100   =   1
	     20 thru 24	   =   2
	     26 thru 50	   =   2   medium quality
		 25	   =   3   good quality


     The final example was given to show how the labels are
     handled.  If a new category value appears in more than one
     rule (as is the case with new category values 1 and 2), the
     last label which was specified becomes the label for that

     category.	In this case the labels are assigned exactly as
     in the two previous examples.

NOTES
     In fact, the r.reclass program does not generate any new
     raster map layers (in the interests of disk space
     conservation).  Instead, a reclass table is stored which
     will be used to reclassify the original raster map layer
     each time the new (reclassed) map name is requested.  As far
     as the user (and programmer) is concerned, that raster map
     has been created.	Also note that although the user can
     generate a r.reclass map which is based on another r.reclass
     map, the new r.reclass map map will be stored in GRASS as a
     reclass of the original raster map on which the first
     reclassed map was based.  Therefore, while GRASS allows the
     user to provide r.reclass map layer information which is
     based on an already reclassified map (for the user's
     convenience), no r.reclass map layer (i.e., reclass table)
     will ever be stored as a r.reclass of a r.reclass.

     To convert a reclass map to a regular raster map layer, set
     your geographic region settings to match the settings in the
     header for the reclass map (an ASCII file found under the
     cellhd directory, or viewable by running r.support) and then
     run r.resample.

     r.mapcalc can also be used to convert a reclass map to a
     regular raster map layer:

	  r.mapcalc raster_map=reclass_map

     where raster_map is the name to be given to the new raster
     map, and reclass_map is an existing reclass map.

BEWARE
     Because r.reclass generates a table referencing some
     original raster map layer rather than creating a reclassed
     raster map layer, a r.reclass map layer will no longer be
     accessible if the original raster map layer upon which it
     was based is later removed.

     A r.reclass map is not a true raster map layer.  Rather, it
     is a table of reclassification values which reference the
     input raster map layer.  Therefore, users who wish to retain
     reclassified map layers must also save the original input
     raster map layers from which they were generated.

     Category values which are not explicitly reclassified to a
     new value by the user will be reclassified to 0.
