NAME
     g.rename - To rename data base element files in the user's
     current mapset.
     (GRASS File Management Program)

SYNOPSIS
     g.rename
     g.rename help
     g.rename [rast=old,new] [vect=old,new] [icon=old,new] [labels=old,new] [sites=old,new]
          [region=old,new] [group=old,new]

DESCRIPTION
     g.rename allows the user to rename data base element files
     in the user's current mapset.  The user can specify all
     necessary information to g.rename on the command line, by
     specifying: the type of data base element to be renamed (one
     or more of: rast, vect, icon, labels, sites, region, and
     group); the specific file element in the current mapset to
     be renamed (old); and the new name to be assigned to this
     file element (new) in the current mapset.  The file element
     old is then renamed to new.

     Users can also simply type g.rename without arguments on the
     command line, to receive a menu of existing data base
     element types and files from which to choose for possible
     renaming:


            1         raster maps

            2         binary vector maps

            3         paint icon files

            4         paint label files

            5         site list files

            6         region definition files

            7         imagery group files

          RETURN to exit

NOTE
     If a data base element has support files (e.g., as is
     commonly the case with raster files), these support files
     also are renamed.

     If the user attempts to rename a file to itself by setting
     the new file name equal to the old file name (e.g., g.rename
     rast=soils,soils), g.rename will not execute the rename, but

     instead state that no rename is needed.  However, g.rename
     will allow the user to overwrite other existing files in the
     current mapset by making the new file name that of an
     already existing file.
