NAME
     d.his - Produces and displays a raster map layer combining
     hue, intensity, and saturation (his) values from user-
     specified input raster map layers.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.his
     d.his help
     d.his h_map=name [i_map=name] [s_map=name] [out=name]

DESCRIPTION
     his stands for hue, intensity, and saturation.  This program
     produces a raster map layer providing a visually pleasing
     combination of hue, intensity, and saturation values from
     two or three user-specified raster map layers.

     The human brain automatically interprets the vast amount of
     visual information available according to basic rules.
     Color, or hue, is used to categorize objects.  Shading, or
     intensity, is interpreted as three-dimensional texturing.
     Finally, the degree of haziness, or saturation, is
     associated with distance or depth.	 This program allows data
     from up to three raster map layers to be combined into one
     new raster map layer which retains the original information
     in terms of hue, intensity, and saturation.

OPTIONS
     This program can be run non-interactively or interactively.
     It will run non-interactively if the user specifies on the
     command line the name of a map containing hue values
     (h_map), and the name(s) of map(s) containing intensity
     values (i_map) and/or saturation values (s_map).  If the
     user also names an output map (out) on the command line, the
     combined hue, saturation, and intensity values will be saved
     as a raster map layer in the user's current mapset;
     otherwise, the resulting image will only be displayed in the
     active display frame on the graphics monitor.

     Alternately, the user can run the program interactively by
     typing d.his without naming parameter values on the command
     line.  In this case, the program will prompt the user for
     parameter values using the standard GRASS parser interface
     described in the manual entry for parser.


     Parameters:

     h_map=name	       Name of input raster map layer to be used
		       for HUE values.

     i_map=name	       Name of input raster map layer to be used

		       for INTENSITY values.

     s_map=name	       Name of input raster map layer to be used
		       for SATURATION values.

     out=name	       Name of the output raster map layer
		       combining hue, intensity, and saturation
		       values from input layers.


     While any raster map layer can be used to represent the hue
     information, map layers with a few very distinct colors work
     best.  Only raster map layers representing continuously
     varying data like elevation, aspect, weights, intensities,
     or amounts can suitably be used to provide intensity and
     saturation information.

     For example, a visually pleasing raster map layer can be
     made by using a watershed map for the hue factor, an aspect
     map for the intensity factor, and an elevation map for
     saturation.  (The user may wish to leave out the elevation
     information for a first try.)  Ideally, the resulting image
     should resemble the view from an aircraft looking at a
     terrain on a sunny day with a bit of haze in the valleys.

THE PROCESS
     Each map cell is processed individually.  First, the working
     color is set to the color of the corresponding cell in the
     map layer chosen to represent HUE.	 Second, this color is
     multiplied by the red intensity of that cell in the
     INTENSITY map layer.  This map layer should have an
     appropriate gray-scale color table associated with it.  You
     can ensure this by using the color manipulation capabilities
     of d.display or d.colors.	Finally, the color is made
     somewhat gray-based on the red intensity of that cell in the
     SATURATION map layer.  Again, this map layer should have a
     gray-scale color table associated with it.

NOTES
     This program produces an image and (optionally) a raster map
     layer with 1000 colors (10 intensities each of red, green,
     and blue).	 The resulting image and raster map layers will
     not display properly if the graphics display monitor does
     not have at least 1000 colors while the user is running in
     float colormode.  Thus, unless the display device has 1000
     colors, it is necessary to run the GRASS command

	  d.colormode mode=fixed

     before running d.his.  Otherwise, the colors will be
     incorrectly displayed on the graphics monitor.

     Either (but not both) of the intensity or the saturation map
     layers may be omitted.  This means that it is possible to
     produce output images that represent combinations of his,
     hi, or hs.
