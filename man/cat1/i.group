NAME
     i.group - An imagery function that creates and edits groups
     and subgroups of (raster) imagery files.
     (GRASS Image Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     i.group

DESCRIPTION
     i.group allows the user to collect raster map layers in an
     imagery group by assigning them to user-named subgroups or
     other groups.  This enables the user to run analyses on any
     combination of the raster map layers in a group.  The user
     creates the groups and subgroups and selects the raster map
     layers that are to reside in them.  Imagery analysis
     programs like i.points, i.rectify, i.ortho.rectify and
     others ask the user for the name of an imagery group whose
     data are to be analyzed.  Imagery analysis programs like
     i.cluster and i.maxlik ask the user for the imagery group
     and imagery subgroup whose data are to be analyzed.

     The first menu in the i.group program asks the user to
     select a group.  If the group does not exist, the user will
     be asked if he or she would like to create a new group.

     This program edits imagery groups. You may add raster map
     layers to, or remove such layers from, an imagery group.
     You may also create new groups.
            Please enter the group to be created/modified

       GROUP: _____________ (enter 'list' for a list of groups)


         AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                        (OR <Ctrl-C> TO EXIT)


     If the word list is entered, groups that have already been
     created in the user's current LOCATION_NAME and MAPSET(S)
     will be listed.  The second menu in i.group provides the
     user with the following options:

          1.    Select a different group
          2.    Edit group title
          3.    Include new raster (cell) files in the group
                or remove raster (cell) files from the group
          4.    Assign colors to the group
          5.    Create a new subgroup within the group

                RETURN to exit

     The options are described as follows:

     Select a different group
          If option number 1 is chosen, the following menu is
          displayed:

               Please enter the group to be created/modified

          GROUP: _____________ (enter 'list' for a list of groups)


            AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                           (OR <Ctrl-C> TO EXIT)


          If the word list is entered, groups that have already
          been created in the current LOCATION_NAME and MAPSET(S)
          will be displayed.


     Edit group title
          If option number 2 is selected, an entry space is
          provided to type in the group title.  This title is
          useful in identifying each group:

                TITLE______________________________________


          This option offers an opportunity to go back and change
          the entry if it is not correct by asking: Look ok?
          (y/n).


(cell) files from the group
     Include new raster (cell) files in the group or remove raster

          When choosing option number 3, the following menu is
          displayed:

              LOCATION: location   GROUP: spot   MAPSET: demo

          If you wish to delete a file from group [spot], remove
          the 'x' from in front of the file name.

                           x_    spot.1 in demo
                           x_    spot.2 in demo

            AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                          (OR Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)


          Next,a menu listing all the other raster map layers
          present in the current MAPSET(S) will be displayed:

           LOCATION: location      GROUP: spot      MAPSET: demo

          Please mark an 'x' by the files to be added in group [spot]

                               MAPSET: demo

                              x_   composite1
                              x_   spotclass1
                              __   spotclass2

            AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                          (OR Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)


          If more than one MAPSET is selected, menus for those
          mapsets will also be displayed.  All raster map layers
          selected with an 'x' will be included in the group
          being updated.

          The user will then have the opportunity to check the
          contents of the group that was just modified:
            Group [spot] references the following raster files

                            __________________
                           spot.1       in demo
                           spot.2       in demo
                           spot.3       in demo
                           composite1   in demo
                           spotclass1   in demo
                            __________________
                              Look ok? (y/n)


          If the user responds with the letter y then the
          following sentence is displayed on the screen:



GRASS 4.0                U.S. Army CERL                         3






i.group              GRASS Reference Manual               i.group



                           Group [spot] updated!


          And the main menu for i.group returns.

          If the user responds n, the menu containing the group
          files after it was modified will be displayed and the
          user will be asked to place an x in front of those
          raster map layers that are to be removed from the
          group.  Then, a menu listing all of the other raster
          map layers in the current MAPSET will be displayed
          again, and the user will be again asked to place an x
          in front of raster map layers to be included in the
          group.  This gives the user the opportunity to correct
          mistakes or make changes in the choice of raster map
          layers to be selected in a group without exiting
          i.group.




     Assign colors to the group
          Option number 4 provides the following menu:

          Please indicate which files to use for red, green, and
          blue colors.  You may leave any color out. You may
          specify more than one color per file.  However, each
          color may only be specified once.  For example, to get
          a full color image, specify r,g,b for 3 different
          files.  To get a grey scale image, specify rgb for a
          single file.

                             b__    spot.1
                             g__    spot.2
                             r__    spot.3
                             ___    composite1
                             ___    spotclass1

                 <<< r,g,b can only be specified once >>>

            AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                          (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)


          This menu allows you to select a color for each imagery
          band or for each file for display.  Note, however, that
          composite images and classified images are already
          assigned colors during their creation.

          An opportunity to change the choice of colors is
          offered after escaping the menu by:

                              Look ok? (y/n)


     Create a new subgroup within the group
          The following menu enables the user to create a
          subgroup out of any combination of raster map layers in
          the group.  Any number of subgroups may be created by
          repeating the option.

              LOCATION: location                MAPSET: spot

          GROUP: spot1
          SUBGROUP: ___________ ('list' will show available subgroups)


            AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                          (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)


          After selecting or creating a subgroup, this menu is
          displayed:

              Mark an 'x' by the files to form subgroup [123]

                             x_    spot.1
                             x_    spot.2
                             x_    spot.3
                             __    composite1
                             __    spotclass1

            AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                          (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)


          The user is then given the opportunity to check the
          contents of the subgroup:

          Subgroup [123] references the following raster (cell) files

                            __________________
                             spot.1   in demo
                             spot.2   in demo
                             spot.3   in demo
                            __________________
                              Look ok? (y/n)


          If the user responds with the letter n, the group menu
          will appear again enabling the user to select raster
          map layers to form the subgroup.
