NAME
     r.average - Finds the average of values in a cover map
     within areas assigned the same category value in a user-
     specified base map.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.average
     r.average help
     r.average [-c] base=name cover=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     r.average calculates the average value of data contained in
     a cover raster map layer for areas assigned the same
     category value in the user-specified base raster map layer.
     These averaged values are stored in the category labels file
     associated with a new output map layer.

     The values to be averaged are taken from a user-specified
     cover map.	 The category values for the cover map will be
     averaged, unless the -c flag is set.  If the -c flag is set,
     the values that appear in the category labels file for the
     cover map will be averaged instead (see example below).

     The output map is actually a reclass of the base map (see
     r.reclass), and will have exactly the same category values
     as the base map.  The averaged values computed by r.average
     are stored in the output map's category labels file.

     If the user simply types r.average on the command line, the
     user is prompted for the flag setting and parameter values
     through the standard parser interface (see parser manual
     entry).

     Alternately, the user can supply all needed flag settings
     and parameter values on the command line.

     Flag:

     -c		       Take the average of the values found in
		       the category labels for the cover map,
		       rather than the average of the cover map's
		       category values.


     Parameters:

     base=name	       An existing raster map layer in the user's
		       current mapset search path.  For each
		       group of cells assigned the same category
		       value in the base map, the values assigned
		       these cells in the cover map will be

		       averaged.

     cover=name	       An existing raster map layer containing
		       the values (in the form of cell category
		       values or cell category labels) to be
		       averaged within each category of the base
		       map.

     output=name       The name of a new map layer to contain
		       program output (a reclass of the base
		       map).  Averaged values will be stored in
		       the output map's category labels file
		       under the user's $LOCATION/cats directory.

EXAMPLE
     Assume that farms is a map with 7 farms (i.e., 7
     categories), and that soils.Kfactor is a map of soil K
     factor values with the following category file:

			  cat	     cat
			 value	    label
			   0	 no soil data
			   1	 .10
			   2	 .15
			   3	 .17
			   4	 .20
			   5	 .24
			   6	 .28
			   7	 .32
			   8	 .37
			   9	 .43

     Then

	  r.average  -c	 base=farms  cover=soils.Kfactor
	  output=K.by.farm

     will compute the average soil K factor for each farm, and
     store the result in the output map K.by.farm, which will be
     a reclass of farms with category labels as follows (example
     only):

			     cat     cat
			    value   label
			      1	    .1023
			      2	    .1532
			      3	    .172
			      4	    .3872
			      5	    .003
			      6	    .28
			      7	    .2345

NOTES
     The -c option requires that the category label for each
     category in the cover map be a valid number, integer, or
     decimal.  To be exact, if the first item in the label is
     numeric, then that value is used.	Otherwise, zero is used.
     The following table covers all possible cases:

		  category label   value used by -c
		  ----------------------------------
		     .12	      .12
		     .80 KF	      .8
		     no data	      0

     (This flag is very similar to the @ operator in r.mapcalc,
     and the user is encouraged to read the manual entry for
     r.mapcalc to see how it works there.)

     The user should use the results of r.average with care.
     Since this utility assigns a value to each cell which is
     based on global information (i.e., information at spatial
     locations other than just the location of the cell itself),
     the resultant map layer is only valid if the geographic
     region and mask settings are the same as they were at the
     time that the result map was created.

     Results are affected by the current region settings and
     mask.
