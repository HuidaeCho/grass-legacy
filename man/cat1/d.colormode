NAME
     d.colormode - Allows the user to establish whether a map
     will be displayed using its own color table or the fixed
     color table of the graphics monitor.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.colormode
     d.colormode help
     d.colormode mode=name

DESCRIPTION
     d.colormode establishes what color table will be used to
     display maps to the graphics monitor.

     Parameters:

     mode=name         Options: fixed or float

     Each time a new raster map layer is drawn on the screen, a
     color table associated with that map is loaded into the
     graphics display monitor.  The command d.colormode
     mode=fixed requests that the monitor's color look-up table
     be fixed (i.e., static).  The effect is that colors drawn on
     the screen by graphics calls will not change when subsequent
     maps are drawn to the screen.  When the fixed option is
     used, the colors in the map's color table are mapped to the
     nearest colors available in the monitor's fixed color table.
     When the float option is used, the map's color table is
     loaded directly into the monitor's color look-up table.

     There are advantages to using each color display mode.  The
     d.display and d.colors programs allow the user to
     interactively modify the color tables of maps displayed to
     the graphics monitor.  This is done by allowing the user to
     directly modify the monitor's color look-up table.  Hence,
     to accommodate this option in d.display and d.colors, the
     d.colormode mode=float option is chosen.  However, this
     option has the sometimes undesirable effect of changing the
     colors in which other maps are subsequently displayed to the
     graphics monitor (although it does not actually change the
     color tables of these latter maps).  The float colormode is
     therefore best used when the user wishes to interactively
     change a map's color table, or when the user wishes to
     display one or more maps having the same color table.  The
     fixed option allows any number of maps to be displayed to
     the screen, where each map uses different colors, but all
     use the same fixed color look-up table.  You cannot toggle a
     map's color table when running in fixed mode.

     This program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies the color mode on the command line (e.g., by

     typing d.colormode mode=fixed or d.colormode mode=float).
     Alternately, if the user simply types d.colormode on the
     command line, the program will prompt the user for the color
     mode using the standard GRASS parser interface described in
     the manual entry for parser.

NOTES
     Some devices support only a fixed color look-up;  e.g.,
     ink-jet printers, plotters, and the AT&T 6300 (running a DEB
     board).  The number of color categories capable of being
     displayed is also device-dependent;  if your colors fall
     outside this range when in float mode, they may not be
     displayed in the colors indicated in the map's color table
     file.  However, the color table files themselves will
     accurately represent the user's changes.
     Color table files associated with raster map layers are
     stored in the user's current mapset under the colr and colr2
     directories.

BUGS
     It is strongly recommended that the user erase the graphics
     monitor screen (e.g., by running d.erase) immediately after
     changing the mode between fixed and float.
