NAME
     d.measure - Measures the lengths and areas of features drawn
     by the user in the active display frame on the graphics
     monitor.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.measure
     d.measure help
     d.measure [c1=name] [c2=name]

DESCRIPTION
     d.measure provides the user with an interactive way to
     measure the lengths and areas of lines and polygons drawn by
     the user in the active frame on the graphics monitor.  Lines
     and polygons are drawn using a pointing device (mouse).
     Each line segment is drawn in colors c1 and c2.  A mouse
     button menu indicates that the user can find out the
     geographic coordinates of the cursor location, draw line
     segments between user-specified vertices, and quit
     d.measure.	 Lines and polygons are defined by the series of
     vertices marked by the user.  If more than two successive
     vertices are drawn, d.measure prints the area encompassed
     (d.measure will assume the area is closed even if the user
     has not joined the first and last vertices).  Line lengths
     are stated in the same units as those of the current
     LOCATION.	Areas are stated in hectares, square miles, and
     square meters.

     Lines and polygons drawn using d.measure will overlay (not
     overwrite) whatever display currently appears in the active
     frame on the graphics monitor.  The user can, for example,
     run d.rast or d.vect prior to running d.measure, and use
     raster and/or vector maps as a backdrop.

OPTIONS
     The user can specify the colors in which line segments will
     be drawn by setting the values of c1 and c2 on the command
     line.  Default line colors (see below) will be used if the
     user does not specify the values of c1 and c2 on the command
     line.


     Parameters:

     c1=name	       The first color in which each line segment
		       is drawn, while being positioned.
		       Options:	 red, orange, yellow, green,
		       blue, indigo, violet, magenta, brown,
		       gray, white, and black
		       Default:	 white

     c2=name	       The second color in which each line
		       segment is drawn, after its vertices are
		       fixed.  Options:	 Same as c1.
		       Default:	 white

NOTES
     d.measure uses all segments drawn by the user when computing
     area.  If the user draws an area within another area, the
     combined area of both regions will be output.
