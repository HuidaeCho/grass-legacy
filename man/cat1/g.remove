g.remove <main>	      GRASS Reference Manual	  <main> g.remove



NAME
     g.remove - Removes data base element files from the user's
     current mapset.
     (GRASS File Management Program)

SYNOPSIS
     g.remove
     g.remove help
     g.remove [rast=name[,name,...]] [vect=name[,name,...]] [icon=name[,name,...]] [labels=name[,name,...]]
	  [sites=name[,name,...]] [region=name[,name,...]] [group=name[,name,...]]

DESCRIPTION
     g.remove allows the user to remove specified data base
     element files from the current mapset.  If g.remove is
     invoked without arguments on the command line, a menu will
     appear listing possible data element types, as below:


	    1  raster maps

	    2  vector maps

	    3  paint icon files

	    4  paint label files

	    5  site list files

	    6  region files

	    7  imagery group files

	  RETURN to exit

     Once the element type is selected, the user is prompted to
     name a specific file of this element type for removal.
     (This list will vary, depending on what files currently
     exist in the user's mapset.)  The specified file is removed,
     and the user is again prompted for the name of a file of
     this element type to be removed.  When prompted for a file
     name, the user may enter list to see a list of existing
     files of this element type, or hit RETURN to get back to the
     above menu.

     Alternately, the user can specify the data base element type
     and file(s) to be removed on the command line.  Data base
     element types are specified by the names to the left, below.

     Parameters:

	  rast=name[,name,...]	   Name(s) of raster file(s) to
				   be removed.

	  vect=name[,name,...]	   Name(s) of vector file(s) to
				   be removed.

	  icon=name[,name,...]	   Name(s) of paint icon file(s)
				   to be removed.

	  labels=name[,name,...]   Name(s) of paint labels
				   file(s) to be removed.

	  sites=name[,name,...]	   Name(s) of site list file(s)
				   to be removed.

	  region=name[,name,...]   Name(s) of region file(s) to
				   be removed.

	  group=name[,name,...]	   Name(s) of imagery group
				   file(s) to be removed.

     The data base element file(s) named by the user on the
     command line are subsequently removed from the user's
     current mapset.


EXAMPLE
     For example, the below command will cause the raster files
     named soils, slope, and temp, the vector files named roads
     and rail, and the imagery group files named nhap.1 and
     nhap.2, and these files' associated support files (e.g.,
     cell header files, category files, etc.), to be removed from
     the user's current mapset.

	  g.remove rast=soils,slope,temp vect=roads,rail
	  group=nhap.1,nhap.2

NOTE
     If a particular data base element file has support files
     associated with it (e.g., as is commonly the case with
     raster files), g.remove will remove these support files
     along with the data base element file specified.

     The user can only use g.remove to remove data files existing
     under the user's current mapset.

FILES
     $GISBASE/etc/element_list lists the element types whose
     files can be removed by the user.
