NAME
     i.target - An interactive imagery function that establishes
     a GRASS target location and mapset for an imagery group.
     (GRASS Image Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     i.target

DESCRIPTION
     i.target targets an imagery group to a GRASS data base
     location name and mapset. During the imagery program
     i.rectify, a location name and mapset are required into
     which to transfer the rectified file just prior to
     completion of the program; i.target enables the user to
     specify this location.  i.target must be run before i.points
     and i.rectify.

     The first prompt in the program asks the user for the name
     of the imagery group that needs a target.  The imagery group
     must be present in the user's current mapset.

     The following menu asking for the target LOCATION NAME and
     MAPSET is displayed:

     Please select the target LOCATION and MAPSET for group <spot>

     CURRENT LOCATION:  location______
     CURRENT MAPSET:  demo___________

     TARGET LOCATION:_________
     TARGET MAPSET:___________

     (Enter list for a list of location names or mapsets within a location)

     An imagery group may be targeted to any GRASS location.

NOTES

     arguments.
