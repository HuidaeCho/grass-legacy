NAME
     r.colors - Creates/Modifies the color table associated with
     a raster map layer.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.colors
     r.colors help
     r.colors [-wq] map=name color=type

DESCRIPTION
     r.colors allows the user to create and/or modify the color
     table for a raster map layer.  The map layer (specified on
     the command line by map=name) must exist in the user's
     current mapset search path.  The color table specified by
     color=type must be one of the following:


     color type   description
     ___________________________________________________________________
     aspect       (aspect oriented grey colors)
     grey         (grey scale)
     grey.eq      (histogram-equalized grey scale)
     gyr          (green through yellow to red colors)
     rainbow      (rainbow color table)
     ramp         (color ramp)
     random       (random color table)
     ryg          (red through yellow to green colors)
     wave         (color wave)
     rules        (create new color table based on user-specified rules)
     ___________________________________________________________________

     If the user specifies the -w flag, the current color table
     file for the input map will not be overwritten.  This means
     that the color table is created only if the map does not
     already have a color table.  If this option is not
     specified, the color table will be created if one does not
     exist, or modified if it does.

     If the user sets the -q flag, r.colors will run quietly,
     Without printing numerous messages on its progress to
     standard output.

     Color table types aspect, grey, grey.eq (histogram-equalized
     grey scale), gyr (green-yellow-red), rainbow, ramp, ryg
     (red-yellow-green), random, and wave are pre-defined color
     tables that r.colors knows how to create without any further
     input.

     The rules color table type will cause r.colors to read color
     table specifications from standard input (stdin) and will
     build the color table accordingly.

     Using color table type rules, there are three ways to build
     a color table:  by color list, by category values, and by
     "percent" values.

     Building a customized color table by color list is the
     simplest of the three rules methods:  just list the colors
     you wish to appear in the color table in the order that you
     wish them to appear.  Use the standard GRASS color names:
     white, black, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, aqua,
     grey, gray, orange, brown, purple, violet, and indigo.

     For example, to create a color table for the raster map
     layer elevation that assigns greens to low map category
     values, browns to the next larger map category values, and
     yellows to the still larger map category values, one would
     type:

        r.colors map=elevation color=rules
        green
        brown
        yellow
        end

     To build a color table by category values' indices, the user
     should determine the range of category values in the raster
     map layer with which the color table will be used.  Specific
     category values will then be associated with specific
     colors.  Note that a color does not have to be assigned for
     every valid category value because r.colors will interpolate
     a color ramp to fill in where color specification rules have
     been left out. The format of such a specification is as
     follows:

        category_value color_name
        category_value color_name
              ..          ..
              ..          ..
        category_value color_name
        end

     Each category value must be valid for the raster map layer,
     category values must be in ascending order and only use
     standard GRASS color names (see above).

     Colors can also be specified by color numbers each in the
     range 0-255. The format of a category value color table
     specification using color numbers instead of color names is
     as follows:

        category_value red_number green_number blue_number
        category_value red_number green_number blue_number
               ..          ..          ..          ..

               ..          ..          ..          ..
        category_value red_number green_number blue_number
        end

     Specifying a color table by "percent" values allows one to
     treat a color table as if it were numbered from 0 to 100.
     The format of a "percent" value color table specification is
     the same as for a category value color specification, except
     that the category values are replaced by "percent" values,
     each from 0-100, in ascending order.  The format is as
     follows:

        percent_value% color_name
        percent_value% color_name
              ..          ..
              ..          ..
        percent_value% color_name
        end

     Using "percent" value color table specification rules,
     colors can also be specified by color numbers each in the
     range 0-255.  The format of a percent value color table
     specification using color numbers instead of color names is
     as follows:

        percent_value% red_number green_number blue_number
        percent_value% red_number green_number blue_number
               ..          ..          ..          ..
               ..          ..          ..          ..
        percent_value% red_number green_number blue_number
        end

     Note that you can also mix these three methods of color
     table specification; for example:
          0 black
          10% yellow
          78 blue
          magenta
          purple
          brown
          100% 0 255 230
          end

EXAMPLES
     (1) The below example shows how you can specify colors for a
     three category map, assigning red to category 1, green to
     category 2, and blue to category 3.  Start by using a text
     editor, like vi, to create the following rules specification
     file.  Save it with the name rules.file.

          1 red
          2 green

r.colors <main>      GRASS Reference Manual       <main> r.colors



          3 blue
          end

     The color table can then by assigned to map threecats by
     typing the following command at the GRASS> prompt:

          cat rules.file | r.colors map=threecats color=rules

     (2) To create a natural looking LUT for true map layer
     elevation, use the following rules specification file.  It
     will assign light green shades to the lower elevations
     (first 20% of the LUT), and then darker greens (next 15%,
     and next 20%) and light browns (next 20%) for middle
     elevations, and darker browns (next 15%) for higher
     elevations, and finally yellow for the highest peaks (last
     10% of LUT).

          0%     0 230   0
          20%    0 160   0
          35%   50 130   0
          55%  120 100  30
          75%  120 130  40
          90%  170 160  50
          100% 255 255 100
