v.clean <main>	      GRASS Reference Manual	   <main> v.clean



NAME
     v.clean - Cleans out dead lines in GRASS vector files.
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.clean
     v.clean help
     v.clean map=name

DESCRIPTION
     When programs like digit delete lines, they do not really go
     away, but are simply marked as deleted.  This is done
     primarily for speed.  But a side effect is that vector files
     can end up carrying a lot of dead weight with them.

     v.clean will go through a vector file and remove all dead
     lines in the file thus potentially reducing the size of the
     file.

     You do not have to run v.support afterwards.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameter:

     map	       Name of the GRASS vector file to be
		       cleaned.

BUGS
     None known.
