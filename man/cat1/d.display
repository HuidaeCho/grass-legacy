NAME
     d.display - A menu-driven, highly interactive display
     program for viewing maps and producing final map products
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.display

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS program d.display is used to display maps on a
     graphics monitor and prepare final map products for
     printing.	It is advisable to first run d.erase before each
     run of d.display to prepare the screen for graphics.

     After invoking the command d.display, the DISPLAY MAIN MENU
     appears on the monitor.  Options in this and subsequent
     d.display menus are selected through use of the pointing
     device (mouse).  When the mouse cursor is over the desired
     menu selection, the user simply presses any button on the
     mouse.

     d.display is a macro that allows the user to access a wide
     range of GRASS display functions in a menu-driven and highly
     interactive environment.  Most of the functions accessible
     through d.display can also be run independently of one
     another by running the GRASS display (d.)	commands listed
     in the SEE ALSO section, below.  However, in many cases,
     these other d. commands give the user greater flexibility
     and make available more options than are available through
     the d.display menus.  For example, the d.display label file
     option runs the d.label command using defaults.  Users
     running d.label directly from the command line have the
     choice of stipulating specific label background and text
     colors, as well as text sizes and font types.  Users running
     the label file option through d.display cannot specify these
     options; instead, default values are used (see d.label for
     default values used).

     The d.display tool is best learned by playing with its
     options.  Refer to the individual d. and other commands in
     the SEE ALSO section for a detailed examination of these
     functions.

NOTES
     The user can also modify the current region settings from
     the DISPLAY MAIN MENU.  Using the mouse, the user can choose
     to zoom in on a portion of the displayed raster map layer to
     create a smaller geographic region.  Once the user has
     defined the corners of this area using the mouse, the
     smaller area is enlarged and replotted on the screen.  The
     user can similarly choose to zoom out.  In this case, the
     user uses the mouse to encompass that portion of the reduced

     map that the user wishes to make the current geographic
     region and display in the center of the screen.  The larger
     map is then replotted and displayed.  Finally, the user can
     enter geographic coordinates for the region's corners from
     the keyboard using the GRASS command g.region.  This is done
     by selecting the type coordinates option.

     The main menu also offers the user the option of hiding the
     main menu for ten seconds (hide menu for 10 seconds).

     The d.display command must be run in conjunction with a
     program which converts the GRASS graphics commands generated
     by d.display to the graphics commands that the current
     device understands.  This device will almost always be a
     graphics monitor.	On most systems the user is required to
     start up this other program separately from (and prior to)
     d.display.	 In such cases, a locally-defined program,
     usually "monitor", is used (see your GRASS manager).  (For
     example, on MASSCOMP machines, the d.mon program must be
     running in the foreground on the graphics monitor.	 On SUN
     machines, the d.mon program can be started from any terminal
     and run in the background.)

     d.display sends program output to the current graphics frame
     (set, by default, to the full graphics screen unless
     modified by the user).  You can use d.frame to create and
     choose a smaller display frame on the graphics monitor for
     use by d.display.

     See the GRASS macro 3d.view.sh stored under $GISBASE/scripts
     for an example of how you can create a d.display-like macro
     using a shell script.
