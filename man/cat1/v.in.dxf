NAME
     v.in.dxf - Converts files in DXF format to ASCII or binary
     GRASS vector file format.
     (GRASS Vector Data Import Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.in.dxf
     v.in.dxf help
     v.in.dxf [-a] dxf=name [lines=name[,name,...]]
     [labels=name[,name,...]] [prefix=name]

DESCRIPTION
     The v.in.dxf data conversion program generates GRASS dig,
     dig_ascii, and dig_att files from a file in DXF format.
     Each layer in the DXF input file is converted to a separate
     dig (or dig_ascii) layer.  For each DXF layer containing
     text, a dig_att file is also created.  These output files
     are placed in the dig, dig_ascii, and dig_att directories
     under the user's current GRASS mapset.

     Output from this program is designed to be used as input to
     the program v.cadlabel.

     The v.in.dxf program will only recognize points, lines,
     polylines, and text in the DXF format, and will translate
     these to GRASS vector format;  other types of data are
     ignored.


     Flag:

     -a             Output an ASCII GRASS vector (dig_ascii) file
                    rather than a binary GRASS vector (dig) file.


     Parameters:

     dxf=name       Name of the DXF input design file to be
                    converted to GRASS vector format.

lines=in_name:out_name[,in_name:out_name,...]
     lines=name[,name,...]  or
                    Name(s) of layer(s) in the DXF input file
                    containing line data, and (optionally) the
                    name(s) to be assigned to the GRASS vector
                    data (dig or dig_ascii) files output.
                    Default:  Convert each layer containing data
                    in the Idxf file to a GRASS vector data (dig
                    or dig_ascii) file.

                    Name(s) of layer(s) in the DXF input file
                    containing text labels, and (optionally) the
                    name(s) to be assigned to the GRASS vector
                    attribute (dig_att) files output.
                    Default:  Convert each layer containing text
                    labels in the dxf map to a GRASS vector
                    attribute (dig_att) file.

     prefix=name    Prefix assigned to the dig or dig_ascii and
                    dig_att output file names.

                    The names of the GRASS vector (dig,
                    dig_ascii, and dig_att) files output are
                    constructed as prefix.extension, where prefix
                    is the prefix name specified by the user and
                    extension is the number of the DXF layer from
                    which the data were obtained.  If the user
                    does not specify a prefix name, the output
                    files take their prefix from the prefix of
                    the input DXF map layer.  For example, for
                    the DXF file named streams.dxf containing
                    line data on layer 15, the GRASS vector map
                    layer output would be named streams.15.

EXAMPLES
     lines=15            Outputs line data in DXF layer 15.

     lines=15,16         Outputs line data in DXF layers 15 and
                         16.

     lines=ROADS,WATER   Converts line data in DXF layers ROADS
                         and WATER.

     lines=15:16         Outputs line data in DXF layer 15, and
                         places it in the dig (or dig_ascii) file
                         for DXF layer 16.



     The below examples are given for a DXF design file named
     cont.dxf containing contour lines and contour line labels,
     in which:

          index contour lines are in DXF layer 9,
          intermediate contour lines are in DXF layer 11, and
          index labels and some intermediate contour lines are in
          DXF layer 12.

     v.in.dxf can be run with default values, as shown below:

          v.in.dxf  dxf=cont.dxf

v.in.dxf <main>      GRASS Reference Manual       <main> v.in.dxf



     Here, this is equivalent to running the following command:

          v.in.dxf  dxf=cont.dxf  lines=9,11,12  labels=12

     Either of the above commands will produce three GRASS dig
     files (named cont.9, cont.11, and cont.12) and one dig_att
     file (named cont.12).

     In our example, however, the cont.12 file contains
     intermediate contour lines that the user would like to add
     to the dig file cont.11.  Our user also wishes to use a
     different file prefix than the default prefix cont.  The
     user therefore types the following command:

          v.in.dxf  dxf=cont.dxf  lines=9,11,12:11  labels=12
          prefix=contour

     The above command will generate three dig files (named
     contour.9, contour.11, contour.12), and will create one
     dig_att file containing text labels (called contour.12).  No
     contour lines will appear in the dig_att file.

NOTES
     Output Filenames:
     The output filename, prefix.extension, conforms with the
     GRASS limit of 14 characters.  The entire prefix name is
     used, a '.' inserted, and as much of the extension name is
     used as the 14 character limit will permit.  Excess
     characters are truncated.  To minimize the possibility of
     creating output files with the same names (resulting in loss
     of data from the DXF file), use the prefix option to
     abbreviate the DXF file name.  This will leave the majority
     of characters available for differentiating between layer
     names.

     Translation:
     This data translation program does not contain any of the
     quality control functions available in v.digit that will
     prevent data in an improper format from being input to a
     GRASS data base.  If present, DXF entities are placed in
     output file(s) corresponding to the layers on which they
     occurred in the DXF design file input.

     Editing:
     If the user asks v.in.dxf to output ASCII vector (dig_ascii)
     files, they must be converted to binary vector format before
     they are usable by most GRASS vector commands.  The user can
     convert GRASS vector files from ASCII to binary format by
     running such programs as v.support or v.in.ascii.  After
     conversion to binary format the vector files can be
     displayed (e.g., with d.vect);  however, the user must run
     v.support on the binary vector files before they can be

     edited in v.digit.  The files output by v.in.dxf will
     preserve the data in whatever form they exist in the DXF
     file.  This means that output files may contain unsnapped
     nodes, overshoots, gaps, and replicated lines.  The data,
     and the file header information (including the owner's name,
     map's name, date, and scale, and UTM zone) for the GRASS
     vector files output may require editing by the user in
     v.digit.

     Attributes:
     The v.in.dxf program attaches attributes only to DXF text
     data that are converted to GRASS vector data (such as
     contour line labels).  Attributes are not attached to
     converted DXF line data.  For each layer of text data in the
     DXF design file, v.in.dxf generates a vector file consisting
     of rectangular boxes (lines) that are drawn around the DXF
     text data, and uses the text values to create a GRASS
     attribute file for the boxes.  The vector and attribute
     files can then be used to label contour lines with the
     v.cadlabel program.
