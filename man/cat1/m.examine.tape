NAME
     m.examine.tape - Provides a description of the files on a
     1/2-inch magnetic tape.
     (GRASS File Management Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     m.examine.tape

DESCRIPTION
     m.examine.tape is a convenient tool for previewing a tape
     and obtaining block size values.  After the user enters the
     command

          m.examine.tape

     the program will prompt the user for the full path name of
     the tape device on which the tape is mounted.  In most
     cases, this will be /dev/rmt0.  However, the user must enter
     this, as there is no default value for the tape device name.
     The user is then prompted to enter the buffer size to be
     used when reading the tape.  The buffer size is the amount
     of memory allocated to read one physical record of the tape.
     If the user hits RETURN, the program will assume a default
     buffer size of 32767 bytes.

     m.examine.tape reads the tape specified by the user and
     reports back the block size (record length) and the number
     of blocks for each file contained on the tape.
     m.examine.tape can be used on any 1/2-inch magnetic tape.
     The user has the option of sending the output into a file or
     viewing the output on the terminal screen.

NOTES
     The buffer size is the amount of memory allocated to read
     one physical record on the tape.  Magnetic tape devices will
     accept a request to read more bytes than actually exist in
     any given record on a tape.  However, m.examine.tape reads
     only as many bytes as physically exist on the tape and
     returns the number of bytes actually read.  The user is
     allowed to alter the buffer size in order to request smaller
     reads for tape devices unable to handle requests this large
     (32767 bytes), or to request larger reads for tapes with
     larger record sizes read on drives able to handle larger
     record sizes.

     Note that m.examine.tape cannot be used to examine the
     content of either ordinary files or 1/4-inch tape
     cartridges.
