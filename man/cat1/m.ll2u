NAME
     m.ll2u - Converts geographic coordinates to Universal
     Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.
     (GRASS Data Import/Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     m.ll2u
     m.ll2u help
     m.ll2u [-rwoz] spheroid=name [zone=value] [input=name]
     [output=name]

DESCRIPTION
     m.ll2u converts geographic coordinates (i.e., latitudes and
     longitudes) to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) eastings
     and northings.  The user must specify the spheroid on which
     to base the UTM conversion.  The user may optionally specify
     the UTM zone;  however, the program can determine this from
     the geographic coordinates submitted.

     The list of spheroids available is somewhat dynamic.  At the
     time of this release, available spheroids included: airy,
     australian, bessel, clark66, everest, grs80, hayford,
     international, krasovsky, wgs66, wgs72, and wgs84 (see table
     below).

     This command can be run either non-interactively or
     interactively.  The user can run the program non-
     interactively by entering desired flag settings and
     parameter values on the command line using the following
     format:

	  m.ll2u [-rwoz] spheroid=name [zone=value] [input=name]
	  [output=name]

     Alternately, the user can simply type:

	  m.ll2u

     on the command line.  In this case, the user will be
     prompted for parameter values and flag settings through the
     standard interface described in the manual entry for parser.

     Input can be entered from the keyboard or from an input
     file.  In either case, input should be entered with one
     longitude and latitude pair per line, in either of the below
     forms:

	  degrees:minutes:seconds{E|W} degrees:minutes:seconds{N|S}
	  degrees:minutes:seconds{E|W} degrees:minutes:seconds{N|S}
	  degrees:minutes:seconds{E|W} degrees:minutes:seconds{N|S}
	  degrees:minutes:seconds{E|W} degrees:minutes:seconds{N|S}
	    .

	    .
	  end

	  degrees.decimal{E|W} degrees.decimal{N|S}
	  degrees.decimal{E|W} degrees.decimal{N|S}
	  degrees.decimal{E|W} degrees.decimal{N|S}
	  degrees.decimal{E|W} degrees.decimal{N|S}
	    .
	    .
	  end

     If the user sets the -r flag, m.ll2u will expect the order
     of the coordinates to be reversed, and stated as latitude,
     longitude pairs, rather than as longitude, latitude pairs.

     Similarly, the user can elect to send output to an output
     file or (by default) to standard output (the user's terminal
     screen).  If the user sets the -w flag, output will be
     printed in a format suitable for input to programs like
     d.points.	Example input and output are shown below (see
     EXAMPLE).

     Program flag settings and parameters have the following
     meanings.

     Flags:

     -r		       The order of coordinates is reversed in
		       the input, and entered as:  lat lon

     -w		       Do not flag invalid lon,lat input lines as
		       errors.

     -o		       Flag other invalid input lines as errors.

     -z		       Suppress printing of the UTM zone in the
		       output.	(Note.	This will produce output
		       in a format suitable for direct input to
		       programs like d.points.)


     Parameters:

     spheroid=name     Reference spheroid (ellipsoid).
		       Options:	 airy, australian, bessel,
		       clark66, everest, grs80, hayford,
		       international, krasovsky, wgs66, wgs72,
		       wgs84

     zone=value	       UTM zone number (results will be forced
		       into this UTM zone).
		       Options:	 1-60

     input=name	       Name of an existing input file containing
		       longitude, latitude coordinates to be
		       converted.  Input lines may either be
		       input in the form of
		       degrees:minutes:seconds, or as decimal
		       degrees.	 If input as decimal degrees,
		       m.ll2u recognizes negative numbers.

     output=name       Name to be assigned to the output file
		       containing UTM coordinates and zone
		       designations.

     where the input file ll.infile contains the following
     longitude, latitude values:

NOTES
     Spheroids, the solids associated with an ellipse, are also
     known as ellipsoids.  They are used as the best possible
     model to simulate the shape of the earth with its flattened
     poles and bulging equator.	 They are the mathematical means
     for establishing control points to use as a reference when
     determining exact locations on the earth.	A cohesive set of
     these control points is called a datum.

     The spheroids listed above have been used as the basis for a
     number of different datums.  The North American Datum of
     1927 (NAD 27) was based on the Clark 1866 ("clark66")
     spheroid.	This was a recent current standard datum for
     North America.  Be aware, however, that a new datum, NAD 83,
     has been developed using the Geodetic Reference System 1980
     spheroid; this is now available in m.ll2u as the "grs80"
     spheroid.	The "wgs66", "wgs72", and "wgs84" spheroids are
     for worldwide use.	 The "wgs72" spheroid has been used
     fairly widely by the Department of Defense (DOD) and is the
     basis for the World Geodetic System 1972 datum.  This datum
     has also been recently replaced; the new DOD datum is WGS 84
     (wgs84).  Both datums are available within m.ll2u.

     To use spheroids other than those listed here, the user can
     add lines to the ellipsoid parameter definition file in
     $GISBASE/etc/ellipse.table.

     Read the marginalia of your source map to determine which
     spheroid was used to produce the map on which you are
     working.

     This program recognizes negative numbers if coordinates are
     input in decimal degrees rather than in the form of
     degrees:minutes:seconds.

     This program has received only limited testing.  It should
     be used with some caution.
