d.mon                GRASS Reference Manual                 d.mon



NAME
     d.mon - To establish and control use of a graphics display
     monitor.
     (GRASS Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.mon
     d.mon help
     d.mon [-lLprs] [start=name] [stop=name] [select=name]
     [unlock=name]

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS program d.mon allows the user to start, select,
     list, query the status of, release control of, stop, and
     unlock control of, available graphics monitors.  The user
     can run this program either interactively (through a series
     of menus), or non-interactively by typing the name of the
     monitor to start, stop, select, or unlock, and any desired
     flags on the command line.

     Flags:

     -l   List all monitors

     -L   List all monitors (with current status)

     -p   Print name of currently selected monitor

     -r   Release currently selected monitor

     -s   Do not automatically select when starting


     Parameters:

     start=name    Name of graphics monitor to start

     stop=name     Name of graphics monitor to stop

     select=name   Name of graphics monitor to select

     unlock=name   Name of graphics monitor to unlock

parameter values,
     When the user enters the command d.mon without specifying
          the below menu appears on the screen:

          Making sure that the graphics monitor is running:

            1      - Start a graphics monitor

                   (also automatically selects this monitor)
            2      - Stop a graphics monitor

          Choosing a graphics monitor for your graphics:

            3      - Select a graphics device for output
                   (currently selected monitor:  name)
            4      - Release control of the graphics driver
                   (let someone else use it)
                   (option 4 appears only after selection of a monitor)

          RETURN   quit

     These parameters perform the following functions:

     1   Start a Monitor.
         In order to display on-screen GRASS graphics, the user
         must start and select a graphics monitor.  By default,
         the start command actually runs two commands, to both
         start and select whatever monitor is named by the user.
         (The user can get a list of available monitors by
         setting the -l or -L flag on the command line.)

         When a monitor is started, it is therefore also
         (automatically) selected for output, unless the -s flag
         is set by the user;  the user can also explictly select
         a monitor that has been started (see (3) below).  After
         a monitor is started, a blank graphics frame should
         appear on whatever terminal the user is using to display
         graphics.

         The desired monitor should be started once and need not
         be restarted unless it is stopped (option 2) for some
         reason.  A monitor may continue to run for any length of
         time, even when no GRASS session is being run.  The
         monitor program runs in the background.

     2   Stop a Monitor.
         Sometimes the monitor program needs to be stopped
         (terminated).  Choosing option 2 will terminate a user-
         specified monitor program.

         A graphics monitor has two different types of status:
         monitor program not running, and monitor running.  A
         monitor that has been started and/or selected will be
         listed as running;  a monitor that has been stopped (or
         not started) will be listed as not running.  The -L
         (list status) flag will list the status of each monitor
         connected to the system.


     3   Select a Monitor.
         When the user starts a monitor, it is also
         (automatically) selected for graphics output unless the
         user sets the -s flag.  In order to use (direct graphics
         output to) a monitor, the user must select that monitor
         for use, either by simply starting the monitor without
         the -s flag or by explictly selecting the monitor for
         output using option 3.  Only running monitors can be
         selected for graphics output.  Once the user has
         selected a monitor for output, no other user can use
         this monitor for graphics output until the monitor
         driver is either released (by the user) or unlocked (by
         any user on the system).
         The user can run multiple graphics monitors by simply

         starting each of the graphics monitors drivers he wishes
         to direct output to.

     4   Release a Monitor.
         Once a user has selected a monitor for graphics output,
         it is locked for use by that user until either:  (1) the
         user voluntarily releases control of the monitor for use
         by another (option 4), or (2) another GRASS user unlocks
         the user's control of the monitor.  Menu option 4
         appears only to the person who has selected the monitor
         (since only that user can release control of his
         selected graphics monitor.) If another user wishes to
         unlock the user's control of the monitor, that user must
         run d.mon from the command line and set the unlock=name
         parameter.

     You may choose multiple options within the d.mon program.
     To leave (exit) the d.mon menu, press the <RETURN> key.

NOTES
     The d.mon program can regulate control of graphics monitors
     both in systems using multiple monitors and in systems using
     a single graphics monitor.
