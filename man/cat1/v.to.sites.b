NAME
     v.to.sites - Converts point data in a binary GRASS vector
     map layer into a GRASS site_lists file.
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.to.sites
     v.to.sites help
     v.to.sites input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     The v.to.sites program extracts site data from a GRASS
     vector map layer and stores output in a new GRASS site_lists
     file.  The resulting sites map layer can be used with such
     programs as d.sites.  Only site (point) features in the
     named vector map layer are extracted and placed into the
     resulting site list.  Lines and areas in the vector file are
     ignored.

     The user can run the program non-interactively by specifying
     the names of an existing vector input map layer and a new
     site list file to be output on the command line.  The
     program will be run interactively if the user types
     v.to.sites without arguments on the command line.  In this
     case, the user will be prompted to enter parameter values
     through the standard user interface described in the manual
     entry for parser.


     Parameters:

     input=name        Name of an existing binary vector map
                       layer from which site data are to be
                       extracted.

     output=name       Name to be assigned to the resultant
                       site_lists file.

     If any of the sites have been labeled in v.digit, then the
     resultant site list will contain category information.  If
     none of the sites are labeled, a binary (0/1) site list file
     will be produced.
