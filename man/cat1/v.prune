NAME
     v.prune - Prunes points from binary GRASS vector data files.
     (GRASS Vector Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.prune
     v.prune help
     v.prune [-i] input=name output=name thresh=value

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS program v.prune allows the user to remove extra
     points from a vector file.	 This allows users to reduce disk
     space required by a vector file and still have data accuracy
     within a given tolerance.

     Flag:

     -i		       The pruning threshold value is specified
		       in map inches, rather than in data base
		       units on the ground.


     Parameters:

     input=name	       Name of binary GRASS vector file
		       containing data to be pruned.

     output=name       Name to be assigned to new, pruned vector
		       output file.

     thresh=value      Threshold value used for pruning.

     The program will be run non-interactively if the user
     specifies all parameters and (optionally) the -i flag on the
     command line, using the form:

	  v.prune [-i] input=name output=name thresh=value

     If the user simply types v.prune without specifying program
     arguments on the command line, the program will prompt the
     user to enter parameter values.

NOTES
     The threshold value is the same as the v.digit pruning
     threshold.	 This is specified in data base units on the
     ground (e.g., in ground meters for UTM data bases).  The
     threshold can also be specified in inches on the map, and
     the program will convert these to data base ground units
     using the scale in the vector file.  If you specify the
     scale in map inches rather than in ground units, you must
     specify that inches are used by setting the -i flag.  The
     input vector data layer will be read and the resultant

     pruned vector data layer will be placed into a newly created
     output file whose name is specified by the user, leaving the
     original vector map unchanged.

     The pruning algorithm throws away redundant points within
     the specified threshold.  It works on each vector
     separately, working from node to node.  It does not change
     the position or number of nodes.
