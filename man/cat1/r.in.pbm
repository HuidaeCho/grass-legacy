NAME
     r.in.pbm (GRASS Raster Data Import Program)

GRASS VERSION
     4.x

SYNOPSIS
     r.in.pbm [-v] input=name

DESCRIPTION
     This program converts a PPM raster file to a GRASS raster
     file. Output is placed in the /cell directory under the
     user's current GRASS mapset.

OPTIONS
Flag:
     Verbose mode.

Parameters:
     Name of an existing PPM raster file to be imported.  Name to
     be assigned to resultant binary raster map layer.	The
     program prompts the user to enter the name of the PPM raster
     file to be converted and the name to be assigned to the
     GRASS raster file to contain the resultant image. Currently
     PPM ASCII and PPM BINARY (PBM) formats are supported.

     The user should adjust boundary coordinates stored in the
     cell header after import using r.support.

     The user must, of course, first create the PPM raster file
     to be converted (e.g., from a scanning system that produces
     PPM raster file format).

NOTE
     The maximum color number is limited to 32768 colors.
