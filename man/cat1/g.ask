NAME
     g.ask  - Prompts the user for the names of GRASS data base
     files.
     (GRASS File Management Program)

SYNOPSIS
     g.ask help
     g.ask type=name [prompt="string"] element=name
     [desc="string"] unixfile=name

DESCRIPTION
     g.ask is designed for shell scripts that need to prompt the
     user for the name of a data base file in the user's current
     GRASS location.  After g.ask is invoked with needed
     parameters, it will query the user for a file name of the
     specified type and element.  After the user responds to this
     query, the program will write four lines to the UNIX output
     file specified by unixfile.

     Parameters:

     type=name	       The type of query.  Options for name are
		       old, new, any, and mapset;  their
		       functions are given below.  "New", "any",
		       and "mapset" only look in the user's
		       current mapset.

		       old     For existing data files anywhere
			       in the user's mapset search path.

		       new     Used to create a new file in the
			       current mapset, which must not
			       already exist there (if a file
			       with this name exists there, it
			       will not be overwritten).

		       any     Creates a file in the current
			       mapset, which may or may not
			       already exist there.  If a file
			       with this name exists in the
			       current mapset, it will be
			       overwritten; if not, a new file
			       with this name will be created.

		       mapset  For files that must exist in the
			       current mapset The shell write
			       wants the name of a file which
			       exists in the user's current
			       mapset.	This type would used
			       instead of "old" if the file is to
			       be modified.

     prompt="string"   The prompt to be displayed to the user.
		       If more than one word, the prompt should
		       be enclosed within double quotes ("").

     element=name      The name of the GRASS data base element
		       (i.e., directory under a GRASS mapset)
		       whose files are to be queried.

     desc="string"     A short description of the data base
		       element which is meaningful to the user.
		       If description contains more than one
		       word, it should be enclosed within double
		       quotes ("").

     unixfile=name     The name of a UNIX file to store the
		       user's response.	 See next section for
		       what is written to this file and how it
		       can be used by shell scripts.

OUTPUT
     Upon receiving the user's response to its request for a file
     name, g.ask writes four lines to the specified unixfile;
     this output file is placed in the user's current working
     directory, unless otherwise specified, and contains the
     following lines:

	  name='some_name'
	  mapset='some_mapset'
	  fullname='some_fullname'
	  file='some_fullpath'

     The output is /bin/sh commands to set the variable name to
     the file name specified by the user (of the element and type
     requested by g.ask), mapset to the GRASS mapset in which
     this file resides (or will be created), fullname is the name
     with the mapset embedded in it, and file to the full UNIX
     path name identifying this file.  These variables may be set
     in the /bin/sh as follows:
	  . unixfile

     The . is a shell command which means read the unixfile and
     execute the commands found there.	It is NOT part of the
     unixfile name and MUST be followed by a space.

NOTES
     The user may choose to simply hit the return key and not
     enter a file name.	 If this happens the variables will be
     set as follows:

	  name=
	  mapset=
	  fullname=

	  file=

     The following is a way to test for this case:
	  if [ ! "$file" ]
	  then
	       exit
	  fi
