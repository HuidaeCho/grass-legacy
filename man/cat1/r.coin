NAME
     r.coin - Tabulates the mutual occurrence (coincidence) of
     categories for two raster map layers.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.coin
     r.coin help
     r.coin [-qw] map1=name map2=name units=name

DESCRIPTION
     r.coin tabulates the mutual occurrence of two raster map
     layers' categories with respect to one another.  This
     analysis program respects the current geographic region and
     mask settings.

     The user can run the program non-interactively by specifying
     all needed flags settings and parameter values on the
     command line, in the form:

	  r.coin [-qw] map1=name map2=name units=name

     Flags:

     -q		       Run quietly, and supress the printing of
		       program status messages to standard
		       output.

     -w		       Print a wide report, in 132 columns
		       (default: 80 columns)


     Parameters:

     map1=name	       Name of first raster map layer.

     map2=name	       Name of second raster map layer.

     units=name	       Units of measure in which to output report
		       results.
		       Options:	 c, p, x, y, a, h, k, m

     Alternately, the user can run r.coin interactively by simply
     typing r.coin without command line arguments; in this case,
     the user will be prompted for the names of the two raster
     map layers which will be the subjects of the coincidence
     analysis.	r.coin then tabulates the coincidence of category
     values among the two map layers and prepares the basic table
     from which the report is to be created.  This tabulation is
     followed by an indication of how long the coincidence table
     will be.  If the table is extremely long, the user may
     decide that viewing it is not so important after all, and

     may cancel the request at this point.  Assuming the user
     continues, r.coin then allows the user to choose one of
     eight units of measure in which the report results can be
     given.  These units are:

     c	  cells

     p	  percent cover of region

     x	  percent of <map name> category (column)

     y	  percent of <map name> category (row)

     a	  acres

     h	  hectares

     k	  square kilometers

     m	  square miles

     Note that three of these options give results as percentage
     values: "p" is based on the grand total number of cells; "x"
     is based on only column totals; and "y" is based on only row
     totals.  Only one unit of measure can be selected per report
     output.  Type in just one of the letters designating a unit
     of measure followed by a <RETURN>.	 The report will be
     printed to the screen for review.	After reviewing the
     report on the screen, the user is given several options.
     The report may be saved to a file and/or sent to a printer.
     If printed, it may be printed with either 80 or 132 columns.
     Finally, the user is given the option to rerun the
     coincidence tabulation using a different unit of
     measurement.

     Below is a sample of tabular output produced by r.coin.
     Here, map output is stated in units of square miles.  The
     report tabulates the coincidence of the Spearfish sample
     database's owner and road raster map layers' categories.
     The owner categories in this case refer to whether the land
     is in private hands (category 1) or is owned by the U.S.
     Forest Service (category 2).  The roads map layer categories
     refer to various types of roads (with the exception of
     category value "0", which indicates "no data";  i.e., map
     locations at which no roads exist).  r.coin does not report
     category labels.  The user should run r.report or r.cats to
     obtain this information.

     The body of the report is arranged in panels.  The map layer
     with the most categories is arranged along the vertical axis
     of the table;  the other, along the horizontal axis.  Each
     panel has a maximum of 5 categories (9 if printed) across

     the top.  In addition, the last two columns reflect a cross
     total of each column for each row.	 All of the categories of
     the map layer arranged along the vertical axis are included
     in each panel.  There is a total at the bottom of each
     column representing the sum of all the rows in that column.
     A second total represents the sum of all the non-zero
     category rows.  A cross total (Table Row Total) of all
     columns for each row appears in a separate panel.

     Note how the following information may be obtained from the
     sample report.
     In the Spearfish data base, in area not owned by the Forest
     Service, there are 50.63 square miles of land not used for
     roads.  Roads make up 9.27 square miles of land in this
     area.
     Of the total 102.70 square miles in Spearfish, 42.80 square
     miles is owned by the Forest Service.
     In total, there are 14.58 square miles of roads.
     There are more category 2 roads outside Forest Service land
     (2.92 mi. sq.)  than there are inside Forest land boundaries
     (0.72 mi. sq.).

     Following is a sample report.

NOTES
     It is not a good idea to run r.coin on a map layer which has
     a monstrous number of categories (e.g., unreclassed
     elevation).  Because r.coin reports information for each and
     every category, it is better to reclassify those categories
     (using reclass) into a more manageable number prior to
     running r.coin on the reclassed raster map layer.

     r.coin calculates the coincidence of two raster map layers.
     Although r.coin allows the user to rerun the report using
     different units, it is not possible to simply rerun the
     report with different map layers.	In order to choose new
     map layers, it is necessary to rerun r.coin.
