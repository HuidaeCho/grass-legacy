NAME
     i.zc - Zero-crossing "edge detection" raster function for
     image processing.
     (GRASS Image Processing Program)

SYNOPSIS
     i.zc
     i.zc help
     i.zc input_map=name zc_map=name [width=value]
     [threshold=value] [orientations=value]

DESCRIPTION
     i.zc is an image processing program used for edge detection.
     The raster map produced shows the location of "boundaries"
     on the input map.  Boundaries tend to be found in regions of
     changing cell values and tend to run perpendicular to the
     direction of the slope.  The algorithm used for edge
     detection is one of the "zero-crossing" algorithms and is
     discussed briefly below.

     This program will be run interactively if the user types
     i.zc without program arguments on the command line.  In this
     event, the program will prompt the user for parameter values
     using the standard interface described in the manual entry
     for parser.  Alternately, the user can run the program non-
     interactively by specifying program parameter values on the
     command line.


     Parameters:

     input_map=name    Name of input raster map layer.

     zc_map=name       Name of raster map layer to be used for
                       zero-crossing values.

     width=value       This parameter determines the x-y extent
                       of the Gaussian filter.  The default value
                       is 9;  higher and lower values can be
                       tested by the user.  Increasing the width
                       will result in finding "edges"
                       representing more gradual changes in cell
                       values.
                       Default:  9

     threshold=value   This parameter determines the
                       "sensitivity" of the Gaussian filter.  The
                       default value is 10;  higher and lower
                       values can be tested by the user.
                       Increasing the threshold value will result
                       in fewer edges being found.
                       Default:  10

     orientations=value
                       This value is the number of azimuth
                       directions the cells on the output raster
                       map layer are categorized into (similar to
                       the aspect raster map layer produced by
                       the r.slope.aspect program).  For example,
                       a value of 16 would result in detected
                       edges being categorized into one of 16
                       bins depending on the direction of the
                       edge at that point.
                       Default:  1


     The current region definition and mask settings are
     respected when reading the input map.

NOTES
     The procedure to find the "edges" in the image is as
     follows: 1) The Fourier transform of the image is taken, 2)
     The Fourier transform of the Laplacian of a two-dimensional
     Gaussian function is used to filter the transformed image,
     3) The result is run through an inverse Fourier transform,
     4) The resulting image is traversed in search of places
     where the image changes from positive to negative or from
     negative to positive, 5) Each cell in the map where the
     value crosses zero (with a change in value greater than the
     threshold value) is marked as an edge and an orientation is
     assigned to it.  The resulting raster map layer is output.
