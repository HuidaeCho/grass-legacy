NAME
     r.grow - Generates an output raster map layer with
     contiguous areas grown by one cell (pixel).
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.grow
     r.grow help
     r.grow [-bq] input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     r.grow adds one cell around the perimeters of all areas in a
     user-specified raster map layer and stores the output in a
     new raster map layer.

     An area consists of any contiguous clump of cells with non-
     zero category values.  No distinction is made between
     differing category values within an area.  Rather, a border
     is grown around the outside of each entire contiguous set of
     non-zero cells.

     The output raster map layer will not go outside the
     boundaries set in the current geographic region.  Thus, if a
     contiguous area in the input raster map layer extends to the
     geographic edge of the current map layer, no new border
     cells can be added to that side of the area.

     Growth around a rectangular area in the input raster map
     layer will occur straight out from each edge, but not
     diagonally from the corners of the rectangle.  Thus, the
     "grown" border area will contain lines along the edge of the
     original rectangle, but the corners of the border will not
     be squared off.  Instead, the lines of the border which go
     along each side of the original rectangle will touch only at
     the corners of the cells at the end of each line.

OPTIONS
     The user can run r.grow either interactively or non-
     interactively.  The program is run interactively if the user
     types r.grow without specifying flag settings and parameter
     values on the command line.  In this case, the user will be
     prompted for input.

     Alternately, the user can run r.grow non-interactively, by
     specifying the names of an input and output map layer, and
     including any desired flags, on the command line.


     Flags:

     -b                Output a binary raster map layer having
                       only zero-one category values, regardless

                       of the category values in the input map
                       layer.  In this case, all cells with a
                       non-zero category value in the input map
                       layer are assigned to category 1 in the
                       output map layer.  If the -b flag is not
                       used, these cells will retain their
                       original non-zero category values.  In
                       either case, all cells whose category
                       value is changed from 0 during the growing
                       process are assigned a category value of 1
                       in the output map.

     -q                Run quietly, supressing printing of
                       information about program progress to
                       standard output.

     Parameters:

     input=name        Name of an existing raster map layer in
                       the user's current mapset search path
                       containing areas to be "grown".

     output=name       Name of the new raster map layer to
                       contain program output.  This map will be
                       binary if the user sets the -b flag.
                       Otherwise, input map cells having non-zero
                       category values will retain their original
                       values.  In either case, all cells whose
                       values changed during growth will be
                       assigned category value 1 in the output
                       map.

NOTES
     The r.grow command can be used to represent the boundary of
     one or more areas.  In this case, the zero-one (binary)
     output option should NOT be used.  Then the input map layer
     can be subtracted from the output map layer using the
     r.mapcalc command.  All original non-zero category values
     will be subtracted out, leaving the boundary areas only.
     This resulting zero-one boundary depiction can be displayed
     over other related raster map layers using the overlay
     option of d.rast.

     If the resolution of the current geographic region does not
     agree with the resolution of the input raster map layer,
     unintended resampling of the original raster map layer may
     occur.  The user should be sure that the current geographic
     region is set properly.
