\fBp.ppm \fR[\fB-f\fR] [\fBinput\*=\fIname\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program, \fIp.ppm\fR, reads a user-specified portable pixmap
(ppm) file and outputs it to the currently selected printer
(see \fIp.select\fR).
The \fIinput\fR ppm file should be one that has been created
using the PPM utilities developed by Jeff Poskanzer.
These utilities can import various image formats (including SUN raster,
X Windows pixmaps, and others) into the PPM formats \fIppm\fR
(color pixmaps), \fIpgm\fR (grey scale maps), and \fIpbm\fR
(black and white bit-maps).
.LP
If the image doesn't fit the output device, it won't get printed.
If you want the image printed (but clipped), use the \fBp.ppm -f\fR option,
or scale the input using \fIppmscale\fR,
or rotate the image using \fIppmrotate\fR
(if it will fit that way -- otherwise you might have to scale it as well).
If the image doesn't fit, \fIp.ppm\fR will tell you what
scaling value to enter to \fIppmscale\fR that will make it fit.

.SH EXAMPLES
If the user is running GRASS on a SUN machine, the following command
could be used to send a monitor screen image to the printer:
.LP
.RS
\fBscreendump | rasttoppm | p.ppm \fR
.RE
.LP

If you are running suntools, the user might type:
.LP
.RS
\fBsleep 10; screendump | rasttoppm | ppmrotate 90 | p.ppm \fR
.RE
.LP
The UNIX \fIsleep\fR command allows you time to arrange the frames
before the screen dump starts.
The \fIppmrotate\fR is usually needed because the SUN screens
are wider than they are long
(and wider than 1024 pixels - which is the width of most of our printers).

If you are running X, the user might type:
.LP
.RS
\fBxwd | xwdtoppm | ppmrotate 90 | p.ppm \fR
.RE
.SH NOTES
This program only supports the ppm binary format (P6).
.LP
Maximum color level is 255.  If the ppm file has more color
levels, use \fIppmcscale\fR to reduce the number of colors.
.LP
No scaling is done.  Use \fIppmscale\fR to change image size.
.LP
No rotation is done.  Use \fIppmrotate\fR to rotate the image.
