\fIv.patch\fR \- Creates a new binary vector map layer by combining
other binary vector map layers.

.B v.patch help 
.br
\fBv.patch\fR \fBinput\*=\fIname\fR[,\fIname\fR,...] \fBoutput\*=\fIname\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I v.patch
allows the user to combine any number of vector map layers together to create
one composite vector map layer.
.LP
\fBParameters:\fR
.IP "\fBinput\*=\fIname,name, ...\fR" 24
Name(s) of input vector map(s) to be patched together.
.IP \fBoutput\*=\fIname\fR 24
Name assigned to composite "patched" vector output map.
.LP
The program will be run non-interactively
if the user specifies the names of the vector map(s) to be patched
and the name of an output file to store the resulting composite patched
vector map on the command line, in the form:
.LP
.RS
\fBv.patch\fR \fBinput\*=\fIname\fR[,\fIname\fR,...] \fBoutput\*=\fIname\fR
.RE
.LP
Alternately, if the user runs \fIv.patch\fR without specifying input and
output file names on the command line (by typing simply \fBv.patch\fR),
the program will prompt the user for inputs using the standard GRASS
interface described in the manual entry for \fIparser\fR.
.SH NOTES
The vector map layers to be patched together must exist in the user's
current mapset search path, and the composite vector map layer name
given must not already exist in the user's current mapset.
.LP
After running \fIv.patch\fR, the header file will contain only information
taken from the first \fIinput\fR file name given in the string  
\fBinput\*=\fIname,name, ...\fR, with the exception of the geographic region's edge
information, and the scale and threshold information.
(The user's current geographic region settings are ignored;
this information is instead extracted from the vector file headers.)
In the new composite vector map layer,
the boundaries of the geographic region will be expanded to encompass
all of the geographic area included in the map layers being patched,
and the scale will be set equal to the smallest (i.e., most gross) scale
used by any of the patched map layers
(this will affect default node-snapping thresholds).
The map threshold is calculated automatically from the map scales
given in the file headers, and (currently) is not used directly.
The composite vector map layer's header will probably need to be edited;
this can be done from within the GRASS program \fIv.digit\fR.
.LP
The GRASS programs \fIv.mkgrid\fR and \fIv.mkquads\fR can be used to ensure
that the borders of the maps to be patched together align neatly.
.LP
Any vectors that are duplicated among the maps being patched together
(e.g., border lines) will have to be edited or removed after \fIv.patch\fR
is run.  Such editing can be done using \fIv.digit\fR.
.LP
After running \fIv.patch\fR the user must run \fIv.support\fR on
the composite vector map layer in order to create a \fIdig_plus\fR
(topology) file for it.
At this time, you can request that a \fIvery\fR small snapping threshold
be used, to cause the nodes that match up across vector map
layers to snap together
without affecting the integrity of the remainder of the vector map layer.
.SH BUGS
The \fIdig_cats\fR and \fIreg\fR file information for the maps being patched
together is not copied to the composite, patched map layer.
The user should therefore run \fIv.support\fR on the output file
produced by this program.
