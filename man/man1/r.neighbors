.SH NAME

category values assigned to the cells around it,
and stores new cell values in an output raster map layer.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIr.neighbors\fR looks at each cell in a raster input file,
and examines the category values assigned to the cells
in some user-defined "neighborhood" around it.
It outputs a new raster map layer in which each cell is assigned a
category value that is some (user-specified) function of the values
in that cell's neighborhood.
For example, each cell in the output layer might
be assigned a category value equal to the average of the category values
appearing in its 3 x 3 cell "neighborhood" in the input layer.
.LP
The program will be run non-interactively if the user specifies
program arguments (see OPTIONS) on the command line.
Alternately, the user can simply type \fBr.neighbors\fR on the command line,
without program arguments.  In this case, the user will be prompted for
flag settings and parameter values.
.SH OPTIONS
The user must specify the names of the raster map layers to be used for
\fIinput\fR and \fIoutput\fR,
the \fImethod\fR used to analyze neighborhood category values
(i.e., the neighborhood function or operation to be performed),
and the \fIsize\fR of the neighborhood.
Optionally, the user can also specify the \fItitle\fR to be assigned
to the raster map layer \fIoutput\fR,
elect to not align the resolution of the output with that of the input
(the \fI-a\fR option),
and elect to run \fIr.neighbors\fR quietly (the \fI-q\fR option).
These options are described further below.

.I Neighborhood Operation Methods:
The \fIneighborhood\fR operators determine what new 
category value a center cell in a neighborhood will have after examining
category values inside its neighboring cells.
Each cell in a raster map layer becomes the center cell of a neighborhood 
as the neighborhood window moves from cell to cell throughout the map layer.
.I r.neighbors
can perform the following operations:
.LP
.IP \fBaverage\fR 18
The average category value within the neighborhood.
In the following example, the result would be:
.br
.ti +5
(7*4 + 6 + 5 + 4*3)/9 \*= 5.66
.br
The result is rounded to the nearest integer (in this case 6).
.IP \fBmedian\fR 18
The category value found half-way through a list of the
neighborhood's category values,
when these are ranged in numerical order.
.IP \fBmode\fR 18
The most frequently occurring category value in the neighborhood.
.IP \fBminimum\fR 18
The minimum category value within the neighborhood.
.IP \fBmaximum\fR 18
The maximum category value within the neighborhood.

.FI
.IP \fBdiversity\fR 18
The number of different category values within the neighborhood.
In the above example, the diversity is four.
.IP \fBinterspersion\fR 18
The percentage of cells containing categories which differ from the category
assigned to the center cell in the neighborhood, plus 1.
In the above example, the interspersion is:
.br
.ti +5
5/8 * 100 + 1 = 63.5
.br
The result is rounded to the nearest integer (in this case 64).

.I Neighborhood Size:
The neighborhood size specifies which cells surrounding any given
cell fall into the neighborhood for that cell.
The size must be an odd integer.
Options are:  1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25.
For example,
.NF
                              _ _ _
                             |_|_|_| 
    3 x 3 neighborhood --->  |_|_|_|
                             |_|_|_|

.FI
.IP \fB-a\fR
If specified, \fIr.neighbors\fR will not align the output
raster map layer with that of the input raster map layer.
The \fIr.neighbors\fR program works in the current geographic region.
It is recommended, but not required, that the resolution
of the geographic region be the same as that of the raster map layer.
By default, if unspecified,
\fIr.neighbors\fR will align these geographic region settings.
.IP \fB-q\fR
If specified, \fIr.neighbors\fR will run relatively quietly
(i.e., without printing to standard output notes on the program's progress).
If unspecified, the program will print messages to standard output by default.
.SH NOTES
The \fIr.neighbors\fR program works in the current geographic region
with the current mask, if any.  It is recommended, but not required,
that the resolution of the geographic region be the same as that
of the raster map layer.  By default, \fIr.neighbors\fR will align
these geographic region settings.  However, the user can elect to keep
original input and output resolutions which are not aligned by specifying
this (e.g., using the \fI-a\fR option).

\fIr.neighbors\fR copies the GRASS \fIcolor\fR files associated with
the input raster map layer for those output map layers that are based
on the neighborhood average, median, mode, minimum, and maximum.
Because diversity and interspersion are indices, rather than direct
correspondents to input category values,
no \fIcolor\fR files are copied for these map layers.
(The user should note that although the \fIcolor\fR file is copied
for \fIaverage\fRd neighborhood function output,
whether or not the color file makes sense for the output
will be dependent on the input data values.)
