.SH DESCRIPTION
.I r.binfer
is an expert system shell containing an inference engine based on
Bayesian statistics (reasoning from past experience).
It is designed to assist human experts in a field develop computerized expert
systems for land use planning and management.  These expert systems are designed
to aid non-experts make decisions about land use.
.LP
In Bayesian expert system programs like \fIr.binfer\fR, the system bases
the probable impacts of a future land use action on the conditional
probabilities about the impact of similar past actions.

.LP
Using appropriate \fIr.binfer\fR syntax, the human expert
structures an input knowledge/control script with an appropriate
combination of map layer category values
(GRASS raster map layers that contain data on soil texture, slope, density, etc.)
and attributes relevant to decision-making
(e.g., rainfall, temperature, season, subjective judgement, etc.).
Options exist for specifying a user interface and a data base containing prior
and conditional probabilities necessary to infer the value of a goal attribute.
The expert also specifies the format for display of end results (raster map layers)
in the input script.
New raster map layers -- one for each possible inferred attribute value -- are created
that contain the probability of the inferred attribute value occurring in each
grid cell.

Alternately, a single new map layer called \fIr.binfer\fR
(or whatever \fIoutput\fR name is specified by the user) is also output.
This map shows, for each grid cell, the inferred attribute value that has
the highest probability of occurring in each grid cell, given the values
of the \fIinput\fR raster map layer and contextual attributes.

\fIr.binfer\fR scripts are typed into
a file by the user using a system editor like \fIvi\fR, and then input to
\fIr.binfer\fR as the \fIinput\fR file named on the command line.
For a complete description of the \fIinput\fR syntax, see the document
\fRGRASS Tutorial:  r.binfer\fR (forthcoming).
For example \fIr.binfer\fR scripts see the EXAMPLES section below.
The results are used to generate the new raster map layers in the user's current mapset.

As stated above, \fIr.binfer\fR scripts contain descriptions of two types of
input attributes.  The map layer type attributes are actual GRASS raster map layers,
with the values defined to be ranges of the categories within that raster map layer.
For example, if the user chooses slope as one of the layer attributes,
the possible values for the slope attribute might be the following:

.TS
center;
l c.
flat	(slopes between 0 and 5 degrees)
low	(slopes between 6 and 10 degrees)
medium	(slopes between 11 and 30 degrees)
steep	(slopes greater than 31 degrees)
.TE

The contextual attributes are those that do not represent raster map layers,
but rather, information that reflects criteria relevant to the specific decision
being contemplated.
For example, if the user chooses "rainfall amount" as one of the contextual
attributes, possible values assigned to the "rainfall amount" attribute
might be the following:

.TS
center;
l c.
low	(rainfall amounts less than an inch)
medium	(rainfall amounts between one and three inches)
high	(rainfall amounts grater than three inches)
.TE

The inferred attribute values are specified along with a prior probability and a
table of conditional probabilities that indicate the probability of that
inferred attribute value occurring given that an input attribute value has occurred.

\fIr.binfer\fR will determine the value of contextual attributes by prompting
the user for input.  It will then open each of the raster map layers corresponding
to each map layer attribute.  \fIr.binfer\fR then determines the values for all
map layer attributes in each grid cell.  Using the conditional probability tables,
the prior probabilities, and Bayes' theorem, \fIr.binfer\fR calculates the
output probabilities for each inferred value and writes its probability of
occurrence as a percentage.  It also determines which value is most
likely to occur in that cell and writes that to the \fIoutput\fR file name.
.SH EXAMPLES
The two sample scripts shown below illustrate only the use of \fIr.binfer\fR to:
(1) estimate the probability that an avalanche will occur, and
(2) infer the probability of finding pine mountain beetles,
at each cell across a landscape, given the input map layer attributes shown below.
The author makes no claims as to the correctness of using these criteria
to infer either event.


                    Some Notes on Script Construction.


1. No Data ( or what to do with category zero).

   If category zero is excluded from the ranges of any layer
   attribute value, it is treated as "no data" and the
   resulting probability and combined maps will reflect this.

   Otherwise, category zero is treated just like any other cell value.

2. Category ranges for layer attributes.

   The category ranges are specified using \fIr.reclass\fR rules.
   For example, a value list for slope might look like this:

     (flat [0 1 thru 3], gentle [4 thru 8], moderate [9 thru 15], 
      other [16 thru 89]).

3. Question Attachments.

   Question attachments can be supplied for and context attribute or
   attribute value.  If names are chosen cleverly, the default menu
   should be sufficient.

4. Determinant List.

   At this time the determinant list serves no real purpose.
   Planned extensions to binfer will make use of this list, 
   so just don't use it for now.

5. Probabilities.
 
   The conditional probability table is very important, try to
   be sure of its accuracy.
