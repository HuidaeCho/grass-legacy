.SH DESCRIPTION
.I m.ll2u
converts geographic coordinates (i.e., latitudes and longitudes)
to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) eastings and northings.
The user must specify the spheroid on which to base the UTM conversion.
The user may optionally specify the UTM zone;  however, the program can determine
this from the geographic coordinates submitted.

The list of spheroids available is somewhat dynamic.
At the time of this release, available spheroids included:
airy, australian, bessel, clark66, everest, grs80, hayford,
international, krasovsky, wgs66, wgs72, and wgs84 (see table below).

This command can be run either non-interactively or interactively.
The user can run the program non-interactively by entering desired flag settings
and parameter values on the command line using the following format:
.LP
.RS
\fBm.ll2u \fR[\fB-rwoz\fR] \fBspheroid\*=\fIname \fR[\fBzone\*=\fIvalue\fR] [\fBinput\*=\fIname\fR] [\fBoutput\*=\fIname\fR]
.RE
.LP

Alternately, the user can simply type:
.LP
.RS
\fBm.ll2u\fR
.RE
.LP
on the command line.  In this case, the user will be prompted for
parameter values and flag settings through the standard interface described
in the manual entry for \fIparser\fR.

Input can be entered from the keyboard or from an input file.
In either case, input should be entered with one longitude and latitude pair per line,
in either of the below forms:
.nf
.LP
.RS
degrees:minutes:seconds{E|W} degrees:minutes:seconds{N|S}
degrees:minutes:seconds{E|W} degrees:minutes:seconds{N|S}
degrees:minutes:seconds{E|W} degrees:minutes:seconds{N|S}
degrees:minutes:seconds{E|W} degrees:minutes:seconds{N|S}

If the user sets the -r flag, \fIm.ll2u\fR will expect the order of the
coordinates to be reversed, and stated as latitude, longitude pairs,
rather than as longitude, latitude pairs.

Similarly, the user can elect to send output to an output file or (by default)
to standard output (the user's terminal screen).  If the user sets the -w flag,
output will be printed in a format suitable for input to programs like \fId.points\fR.
Example input and output are shown below (see EXAMPLE).

Program flag settings and parameters have the following meanings.
.LP
\fBFlags:\fR
.IP \fB-r\fR 18
The order of coordinates is reversed in the input, and entered as:  \fIlat lon\fR
.IP \fB-w\fR 18
Do not flag invalid lon,lat input lines as errors.
.IP \fB-o\fR 18
Flag other invalid input lines as errors.
.IP \fB-z\fR 18
Suppress printing of the UTM zone in the output.  (Note.  This will produce
output in a format suitable for direct input to programs like \fId.points\fR.)

.LP
\fBParameters:\fR
.IP \fBspheroid\*=\fIname\fR 18
Reference spheroid (ellipsoid).
.br
Options:  airy, australian, bessel, clark66, everest, grs80, hayford,
international, krasovsky, wgs66, wgs72, wgs84
.IP \fBzone\*=\fIvalue\fR 18
UTM zone number (results will be forced into this UTM zone).
.br
Options:  1-60
.IP \fBinput\*=\fIname\fR 18
Name of an existing input file containing longitude, latitude coordinates to be
converted.  Input lines may either be input in the form of
degrees:minutes:seconds, or as decimal degrees.  If input as decimal
degrees, \fIm.ll2u\fR recognizes negative numbers.
.IP \fBoutput\*=\fIname\fR 18
Name to be assigned to the output file containing UTM coordinates and zone designations.

.SH NOTES
Spheroids, the solids associated with an ellipse, are also known
as ellipsoids.  They are used as the best possible model to
simulate the shape of the earth with its flattened
poles and bulging equator.  They are the mathematical
means for establishing control points to use as a
reference when determining exact locations on the earth.
A cohesive set of these control points is called a \fBdatum\fR.

The spheroids listed above have
been used as the basis for a number of different datums.
The North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27) was based on the
Clark 1866 ("clark66") spheroid.  This was a recent current standard datum for North
America.  Be aware, however, that a new datum, NAD 83, has been
developed using the Geodetic Reference System 1980 spheroid;
this is now available in \fIm.ll2u\fR as the "grs80" spheroid.
The "wgs66", "wgs72", and "wgs84" spheroids are for worldwide use.
The "wgs72" spheroid has been used fairly widely by the Department of Defense (DOD)
and is the basis for the World Geodetic System 1972 datum.
This datum has also been recently replaced;
the new DOD datum is WGS 84 (wgs84).
Both datums are available within \fIm.ll2u\fR.

To use spheroids other than those listed here, the user can add lines to the
ellipsoid parameter definition file in $GISBASE/etc/ellipse.table.

Read the marginalia of your source map to determine
which spheroid was used to produce the map on which you are working.

This program recognizes negative numbers if coordinates are
input in decimal degrees rather than in the form of
degrees:minutes:seconds.

This program has received only limited testing.
It should be used with some caution.
