.TH d.save
.SH NAME
\fId.save\fR \- Creates a list of commands for recreating screen graphics.
.br
.I "(GRASS Display Program)"
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBd.save\fR
.br
\fBd.save help\fR
.br
\fBd.save\fR [\fB-ca\fR] [\fBframe\*=\fIname\fR[,\fIname\fR,...]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
When GRASS display (d.) commands are used to generate graphical images
on the graphics monitor,
some commands are noted in lists that the current graphics driver
(see manual entry for \fId.mon\fR) maintains.  This command, \fId.save\fR,
uses this information to create a shell script that can be used to recreate
graphics in another frame at another time.  The shell script is sent
to standard output (the user's terminal).  If you wish to save the
shell script created by \fId.save\fR, its output should be redirected
to a file;  for example:
.LP
.RS
\fBd.save > script.out \fR
.RE
.LP
The user can run the program non-interactively by specifying flag settings
and parameter values on the command line.  If the user types
\fBd.save\fR without specifying these program arguments, the user
will be prompted for inputs through the standard user interface described
in the manual entry for \fIparser\fR.
.SH "COMMAND LINE OPTIONS"
.LP
\fBFlags:\fR
.IP \fB-c\fR 18
Shell script will contain only information for regenerating graphics
from the active (current) frame.  Use of this flag overrides the 
\fIframe\fR option (below).
.IP \fB-a\fR 18
Save information needed to regenerate all the frames on the graphics
monitor.  The shell script can be used to completely
reconstruct the contents of the graphics screen.
.LP
\fBParameter:\fR
.IP "\fBframe\*=\fIname\fR[,\fIname\fR,...]" 18
Name(s) of those display frame(s) to be saved.
.br
Options:  All available frames
.br
Default:  Active frame
.SH NOTES
Display commands used interactively, and those that take their graphic
instructions from standard input, will not be saved by \fId.save\fR.
