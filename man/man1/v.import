\fIv.import\fR  \-  Converts ASCII Digital Line Graph (DLG) files, binary DLG files,
and ASCII vector files into binary vector files and creates the needed
vector support files.

.I (GRASS Vector Program)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B v.import
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIv.import\fR is an interactive program which runs other vector
import programs.  It allows you to import DLG or ASCII vector
files into GRASS vector format.  It also runs \fIv.support\fR.
No arguments are required on the command line.
However, before
running \fIv.import\fR, the user should move the ASCII DLG files
to be imported into GRASS in a directory named \fBdlg\fR under
the user's current GRASS mapset (i.e., under the
directory known to GRASS as $LOCATION).  If a \fBdlg\fR directory
does not already exist under the user's current GRASS mapset,
then the user will have to make one using the UNIX \fImkdir\fR command,
and then move the ASCII DLG files to be imported under that new
\fBdlg\fR directory.

This program performs all of the processes that are needed to convert
ASCII Digital Line Graph (DLG) files, binary DLG files, and ASCII vector files
into binary vector files.
It also creates two support files, the \fBdig_plus\fR file and the
\fBdig_att\fR file (only created when importing DLG files).
The \fBdig_plus\fR file contains topological information obtained by
analyzing the vector file.
The \fBdig_att\fR file contains category (attribute) information
'stripped' from the DLG file.  This \fBdig_att\fR file is created for vector
files by the labeling function of the GRASS \fIv.digit\fR program.
All of the above files must be run through \fIv.import\fR before they
can be used in the \fIv.digit\fR program of GRASS 4.0.
.SH IMPORT FILES
After entering the command \fBv.import\fR, the user will be asked
for the type of file that is to be imported and for which
support files will be created:

.RS
.nf
         Import to GRASS Vector Format and Create Needed Support Files

 1  -   ASCII DLG file to GRASS Vector Format
 2  -   Binary DLG file to GRASS Vector Format
 3  -   ASCII VECTOR file to GRASS Vector Format
 4  -   Binary VECTOR file to GRASS Vector Format
.RE
.fi

If numbers 1-3 are chosen, \fIv.import\fR will respond with the current
data base units (in feet or meters), and ask if the new vector 
file is in the correct units for the data base location.
If the new vector file is not in the correct units, \fIv.import\fR
will not allow it to be placed in the current data base location.
For each data base location, all map layers should have the same units.
If, for some reason, a map layer uses different units than the rest
of the map layers in the same data base location, a new data base
location will have to be created for it.

.SH "ASCII DLG File to GRASS Vector Format:"
Convert an ASCII DLG file (such as those created in GRASS 2.0) to a GRASS vector
file and creates the \fBdig_plus\fR and \fBdig_att\fR support files. 
The user is asked two questions:
.nf
.RS

1. Determine if this map is composed of Area or Line information.
   Do you want to give precedence to Areas (opposed to Lines)? (y/n) [y]
.fi

\fBNOTE\fR: Some machine-processed DLG files do not make the
distinction between lines and area edges.  For example, in a roads map, where
the desired information is line data,
a downtown block surrounded by roads may be processed as an area.
Because of this, the user is asked to choose whether to give precedence
to areas or lines.
If precedence is given to lines, the user should be aware that any lines
that bound unlabeled areas in the DLG file will be stored as line data.
Any unlabeled areas would therefore be lost (this is only a concern
when areas are unlabeled, labeled area information will be retained).
If precedence is given to areas, lines will be stored as boundaries 
to areas that are unlabeled. 

.nf
.br
2. During the building of the Vector format:
   Do you want to snap nodes to other nodes within a threshold (y/n) [n]
.fi

\fBNOTE\fR: BE CAREFUL!  This threshold is calculated using the scale of the
original DLG or \fIdig\fR file.  If the threshold is too high,
excessive snapping may occur, destroying the file.  In general, users
seldom need to snap nodes.
If snapping of nodes is desired, the user may want to run
\fIv.support\fR separately. 
\fIv.support\fR allows the user to set the snapping threshold.

This process is done in three phases:
.br
1. The ASCII DLG file is converted to a binary DLG file.
.br
2. The binary DLG file is converted to a binary Vector file,
and the
\fBdig_att\fR support file containing attribute (category)
information is created.
.br
3. The \fBdig_plus\fR support file is created by analyzing the vector 
file for topological information.

.SH "Binary DLG File to GRASS Vector Format:"
Converts binary DLG files (such as those created in GRASS 2.0) to a vector
file and creates the \fBdig_plus\fR and \fBdig_att\fR support files. The user
is asked whether precedence should be given to Areas or Lines and if nodes
should be snapped to other nodes within a calculated threshold.

This process is done in two phases:
.br
1. The binary dlg file is converted to a binary vector file,
and the \fBdig_att\fR vector support file containing attribute information
is created.
.br
2. The \fBdig_plus\fR vector support file is created by analyzing the vector 
file for topological information.

.SH "ASCII Vector file to GRASS Vector Format:"
Converts ASCII vector files (such as those created in GRASS 2.0) into 
GRASS binary vector files,
and creates the \fBdig_plus\fR vector support file.  Since a vector
maintains the distinction between lines and area edges, the user is not
asked to give precedence to either.  However, the user will be asked if 
snapping from nodes to other nodes within a calculated threshold is desired.

This process is done in two phases:
.br
1. The ASCII vector file is converted to a binary vector file, and the
\fBdig_plus\fR vector support file is created.
.br
2. The \fBdig_plus\fR vector support file is created by analyzing the vector 
file for topological information.

.SH "Binary Vector file to GRASS Vector Format:"
Creates the \fBdig_plus\fR vector support file.

This process is done in one phase:
.br
1. The \fBdig_plus\fR vector support file is created by analyzing the vector 
file for topological information.
.SH NOTES
Before running \fIv.import\fR, the user should move the ASCII DLG files
to be imported into GRASS in a directory named \fBdlg\fR under
the user's current GRASS mapset (i.e., under the
directory known to GRASS as $LOCATION).  If a \fBdlg\fR directory
does not already exist under the user's current GRASS mapset,
then the user will have to make one using the UNIX \fImkdir\fR command,
and then move the ASCII DLG files to be imported under that new
\fBdlg\fR directory.
