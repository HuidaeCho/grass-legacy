.TH exit
.SH NAME
\fIexit\fR \- Exits the user from the current GRASS session.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B exit
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIexit\fR command
ends the user's current GRASS session and returns the user
to the directory in which he was working prior to entering GRASS.
When the user exits GRASS, he is asked whether he wishes to save
the files and data stored under his current mapset,
and (if maps are present) whether the user wishes to selectively
remove map layers, before exiting the system.
By default, if the user presses RETURN without responding to these
questions, all maps in the user's current mapset are saved.
However, because such maps can consume much storage space on the computer,
the user should remove any unneeded files before exiting.
(The user can also remove data before attempting to \fIexit\fR GRASS
using the \fIg.remove\fR command.)
.LP
Before typing \fIexit\fR, the polite user should remember to release the
graphics display monitor (using the command \fBd.mon -r\fR)
for use by other GRASS users.  Otherwise, the display device may be locked
for use by the user, even though the user has exited GRASS, until another
user runs \fId.mon\fR and unlocks this monitor for others' use.
.LP
Each time the user re-enters GRASS, the variables described in \fIg.gisenv\fR
are re-set.  If the user wishes to change the mapset, location,
or data base on which he is working
(i.e., those affected by any GRASS programs running
during the user's current GRASS session),
the user must \fIexit\fR GRASS and then re-enter GRASS and specify
a different mapset, location, and/or data base location on the GRASS
start-up page.  When the user re-enters GRASS, these variable settings
(the current mapset, location, and data base) are set by default to
those used in the user's previous GRASS session, unless changed by the user.
.SH "NOTES"
This program requires no command line arguments;  the user simply types
\fBexit\fR on the command line to exit GRASS.
