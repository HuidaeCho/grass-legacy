.SH NAME
\fIr.report\fR \- Reports statistics for raster map layers.

\fBr.report \fR[\fB-hmfq\fR] \fBmap\*=\fIname\fR[,\fIname\fR,...] [\fBunits\*=\fIname\fR[,\fIname\fR,...]] \

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I r.report
allows the user to set up a series of report parameters to be applied to
a raster map layer, and creates a report.
If invoked with command line arguments, the report will print out
to the screen only.  However, output may be
redirected to a file or another program using the UNIX redirection
mechanism.  If invoked without command line arguments, the user
is given the option of printing out each report and/or saving
output to a file.

The program will be run non-interactively, if the user specifies
the names of raster map layers and any desired options on the
command line, using the form
.LP
.RS
\fBr.report \fR[\fB-hmfq\fR] \fBmap\*=\fIname\fR[,\fIname\fR,...] [\fBunits\*=\fIname\fR[,\fIname\fR,...]] \
[\fBpl\*=\fIvalue\fR] [\fBpw\*=\fIvalue\fR]
.RE
.LP
where each map \fIname\fR is the name of a raster map layer on which to report,
each unit \fIname\fR is a unit of measure in which results are to be reported,
the pl \fIvalue\fR gives the page length,
the pw \fIvalue\fR gives the page width, and the (optional) flags
\fI-h\fR, \fI-m\fR, \fI-f\fR, and \fI-q\fR have the meanings stated below.

.LP
\fBFlags:\fR
.IP \fB-h\fR 20
Suppress the print-out of page headers.
.IP \fB-m\fR 20
Report on zero values, because a mask is being used.
.IP \fB-f\fR 20
Use formfeeds between pages when printing report output.
.IP \fB-q\fR 20
Run quietly, without printing program messages to standard output.
.LP
\fBParameters:\fR
.IP "\fBmap\*=\fIname,name,...\fR" 20
Names of raster map(s) on which to report.
.IP "\fBunits\*=\fIname\fR" 20
Units of measure in which results are to be reported.
These units are based on the number of cells in the user's
\fIarea of interest\fR (i.e., cells within the current 
geographic region definition, and the current mask [if any]).
These are established with the programs
\fIg.region\fR and \fIr.mask\fR, respectively.
.br
Options:  Possible units of measurement are:
.br
\fBmi\fR   (cover measured in square \fImiles\fR)
.br
\fBme\fR   (cover measured in square \fImeters\fR)
.br
\fBk\fR    (cover measured in square \fIkilometers\fR)
.br
\fBa\fR    (cover measured in \fIacres\fR)
.br
\fBh\fR    (cover measured in \fIhectares\fR)
.br
\fBc\fR    (the number of \fIcells\fR in the area of interest)
.br
\fBp\fR    (the \fIpercent cover\fR, excluding no data areas)
.IP "\fBpl\*=\fIvalue\fR" 20
Page length, in lines, in which report will be output.
.br
Default:  0   (lines)
.IP "\fBpw\*=\fIvalue\fR" 20
Page width, in characters, in which report will be output.
.br
Default:  79   (characters)
.IP "\fBoutput\*=\fIname\fR" 20
The name of a file to store the report in. If not specified, the report is printed
on the terminal screen.

.LP
Alternately, the user can simply type \fBr.report\fR on the command line,
without program arguments.  In this case, the user will be prompted for
program flag settings and parameter values.
.LP
The report itself consists of two parts, a header section and the main
body of the report.
.LP
The header section of the report identifies the raster map layer(s)
(by map layer name and title), location, mapset, report date,
and the region of interest.  The area of interest is described
in two parts:  the user's current geographic region is presented,
and the mask is presented (if any is used).
.LP
The main body of the report consists of from one to three tables
which present the statistics for
each category and the totals for each unit column.
.LP
Note that, unlike \fIr.stats\fR, \fIr.report\fR allows
the user to select the specific units of measure in which
statistics will be reported.
.LP
Following is the result of a
.I r.report
run on the raster map layer
\fIgeology\fR (located in the Spearfish, SD sample data base),
with the units expressed in square miles and acres.
Here, \fIr.report\fR
output is directed into the file \fIreport.file\fR.

.SH NOTES
If the user runs \fIr.report\fR interactively and saves the report output
in a file, this file will be placed
into the user's current working directory.
.LP
If the user runs \fIr.report\fR non-interactively, report output can
be saved by redirecting it to a file or a printer using the
UNIX redirection mechanism.
