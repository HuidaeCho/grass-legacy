Use at your own risk. This software comes with absolutely no warranty.

No checks are performed for datum, projection and format of data.
You must check by yourself that your receiver, gpstrans and GRASS
use the same map datum and projection (this means as it is now that
you can only use a GRASS database in lat/lon projection and in wgs84
datum).
