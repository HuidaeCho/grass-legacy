.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIg.region\fR program allows the user to manage the settings of the
current geographic region.
These regional boundaries can be set by the user directly and/or
set from a region definition file
(stored under the \fIwindows\fR directory in the user's current mapset).
The user can create, modify, and store as many geographic region definitions
as desired for any given mapset.
However, only one of these geographic region definitions will be current
at any given moment, for a specified mapset;  i.e., GRASS programs that
respect the geographic region settings will use the current geographic
region settings.
.SH INTERACTIVE PROGRAM USE:  MAIN MENU
The main menu consists of an information section listing the current
GRASS data base LOCATION, MAPSET, and CURRENT REGION, followed by user options:

.SH DEFINITIONS
.TP
.B Region:
.br
Here, a \fIregion\fR refers to a geographic area with some defined
boundaries, based on a specific map coordinate system and map projection.
Each region also has associated with it the specific east-west and north-south
resolutions of its smallest units (rectangular units called "cells").

The region's boundaries are given as the northernmost, southernmost,
easternmost, and westernmost points that define its extent.
The north and south boundaries are commonly called \fInorthings\fR,
while the east and west boundaries are called \fIeastings\fR.

The region's cell resolution defines the size of the smallest piece of data
recognized (imported, analyzed, displayed, stored, etc.) by GRASS programs
affected by the current region settings.
The north-south and east-west cell resolutions need not be the same,
thus allowing non-square data cells to exist.
.TP
.B Default Region:
Each GRASS LOCATION_NAME has a fixed geographic region, called the
default geographic region (stored in the region file DEFAULT_WIND under the
special mapset PERMANENT), that defines the extent of the data base.
While this provides a starting point for defining new geographic regions,
user-defined geographic regions need not fall within this geographic region.
.TP
.B Current Region:
Each mapset has a current geographic region.
This region defines the geographic area in which all GRASS displays and
analyses will be done.  Data will be resampled, if necessary,
to meet the cell resolutions of the current geographic region setting.
.TP
.B Region Data Base:
Each GRASS MAPSET may contain any number of pre-defined, and named,
geographic regions.  These region definitions are stored in the user's
current mapset location under the \fIwindows\fR directory (also referred
to as the user's data base of region definitions).
Any of these pre-defined geographic regions may be selected,
by name, to become the current geographic region.
Users may also access saved region definitions stored under other mapsets
in the current location, if these mapsets are included in the user's
mapset search path.
.SH REGION EDIT PROMPT
Most of the options will require the user to edit a geographic region,
be it the current geographic region or one stored in the user's data base
of region definitions (the \fIwindows\fR directory).
A standard prompt is used to perform this edit.
An example is shown below:

The fields NORTH EDGE, SOUTH EDGE, WEST EDGE and EAST EDGE,
are the boundaries of the geographic region that the user can change.
The fields Default North, Default South, Def West and Def East
are the boundaries of the default geographic region
that are displayed for reference and \fIcannot\fR be changed.
The two GRID RESOLUTION Region fields (east-west, and north-south)
are the geographic region's cell resolutions that the user can change.
The two GRID RESOLUTION Default fields list the resolutions of the
default geographic region;  these are displayed for reference
and cannot be changed here by the user.
.SH REGION MANAGEMENT MENU OPTIONS
.TP
1 Modify the current geographic region directly
Allows the user to edit the current region.
.TP
2 Set current geographic region from default region
Copies the default region to the current geographic region,
and then lets the user edit the current geographic region.
.TP
3 Set current geographic region from a data base geographic region
Allows the user to select a geographic region by name from the data base
of geographic regions to become the current geographic region,
and then lets the user edit the current geographic region.

Note:  geographic region definition files
may be selected from other mapsets as well, if accessible and
in the user's mapset search path.
.TP
4 Set current geographic region from a raster (cell) map layer
Allows the user to select a raster map layer,
copies the cell header for this map layer to the current geographic region,
and then lets the user edit the current geographic region.
This option is useful when subsequent GRASS operations will
be used to produce a raster map layer from one input raster map layer
and it is necessary that the result coincide with the input raster map layer.
.TP
5 Save the current geographic region (window) in the data base
Allows the user to save the current geographic region settings
in the user's data base of such settings.  These files are
stored in the \fIwindows\fR directory under the user's current mapset.
This option is useful when the current geographic region
is set directly using option 2, or even by another GRASS program
(e.g., \fId.display\fR).
This option installs an otherwise temporary geographic region setting
into the geographic region definition data base for recall when needed.
.TP
6 Create a new data base geographic region setting
Creates a new geographic region definition in the user's data base of
such settings in the \fIwindows\fR directory under the current mapset,
using the geographic region edit prompt described above.
After the geographic region definition is created, the user is asked if this
geographic region setting should also be used as the current geographic region.
.TP
7 Modify a data base geographic region setting
Modifies a geographic region setting (in the data base of such settings
in the \fIwindows\fR directory of the current mapset),
using the geographic region edit prompt.
After the changes have been made, the user is asked if this 
geographic region setting should also be used as the current geographic region.
.SH NON-INTERACTIVE PROGRAM USE
Alternately, the user can modify the settings of the current geographic region
by specifying all needed parameters on the command line.
The user enters the command  \fBg.region\fR \fIparms\fR, where
\fIparms\fR are the following parameters and/or flags:
.LP
\fBFlags:\fR
.IP \fB-d\fR 18
Set current region settings equal to default region settings.
.IP \fB-g\fR 18
Print the current region settings (shell script style) in a
format that can be given back to \fIg.region\fR on its command line.
.IP \fB-p\fR 18
Print the current region settings.
.IP \fB-u\fR 18
Do not update the current region file settings.  Allows the user to
temporarily use a different region setting, without saving this setting.
.LP
\fBParameters:\fR
.IP \fBregion\*=\fIname\fR 18
Make current region settings same as the named region file settings
.IP \fBraster\*=\fIname\fR 18
Make current region settings same as those in the named raster map's
cell header.  But see \fBzoom\*=\fIname\fR option, below.
.IP \fBvector\*=\fIname\fR 18
Make the current region settings the same as those of the named vector map.
.IP \fBsites\*=\fIname\fR 18
Set the current region to the smallest region encompassing all
coordinates in the named site_lists file, aligned with the current region.
.IP \fBn\*=\fIvalue\fR 18
Set map coordinate value for the region's northern edge to x
.IP \fBs\*=\fIvalue\fR 18
Set map coordinate value for the region's southern edge to x
.IP \fBe\*=\fIvalue\fR 18
Set map coordinate value for the region's eastern edge to x
.IP \fBw\*=\fIvalue\fR 18
Set map coordinate value for the region's western edge to x
.IP \fBres\*=\fIvalue\fR 18
Set grid resolution (both north-south and east-west) to x
.IP \fBnsres\*=\fIvalue\fR 18
Set north-south grid resolution value to x
.IP \fBewres\*=\fIvalue\fR 18
Set east-west grid resolution value to x
.IP \fBzoom\*=\fIname\fR 18
Set current region settings to the smallest region encompassing
all non-zero data in the named raster map layer
that fall inside the user's current region.
.br
If the user also includes the \fBraster\*=\fIname\fR option
on the command line,
\fBzoom\*=\fIname\fR will set the current region settings to the
smallest region encompassing all non-zero data in the named \fBzoom\fR map
that fall inside the region stated in the cell header for the
named \fBraster\fR map.
.IP \fBalign\*=\fIname\fR 18
Set the current resolution equal to that of the named raster map, and
align the current region to a row and column edge in the named map.
Alignment only moves the existing region edges outward to the edges of the
next nearest cell in the named raster map -- not to the named map's edges.
To perform the latter function, use the \fBraster\*=\fIname\fR option.
.IP \fBsave\*=\fIname\fR 18
Save current region settings in the named region file
.SH EXAMPLES
\fBg.region n\*=7360100 e\*=699000\fR
.RS
will reset the northing and easting for the current region, but leave the
south edge, west edge, and the region cell resolutions unchanged.
.RE

\fBg.region \-dp s\*=698000\fR
.RS
will set the current region from the default region for the GRASS
data base location,
reset the south edge to 698000, and then print the result.
.RE

\fBg.region n\*=n\*+1000 w\*=w\*-500\fR
.RS
The n\*=\fIvalue\fR may also be specified as a function of its current
value:  n\*=n\*+\fIvalue\fR increases the current northing,
while n\*=n\*-\fIvalue\fR decreases it.
This is also true for s\*=\fIvalue\fR, e\*=\fIvalue\fR, and w\*=\fIvalue\fR.
In this example the current region's northern boundary is extended by 1000 units
and the current region's western boundary is decreased by 500 units.
.RE

\fBg.region n\*=s\*+1000 e\*=w\*+1000\fR
.RS
This form allows the user to set the region boundary values relative to one
another.  Here, the northern boundary coordinate is set equal to 1000 units
larger than the southern boundary's coordinate value,
and the eastern boundary's coordinate value is set equal to 1000 units larger
than the western boundary's coordinate value.
The corresponding forms s\*=n-\fIvalue\fR and
.br
w\*=e-\fIvalue\fR may be
used to set the values of the region's southern and western boundaries,
relative to the northern and eastern boundary values.
.RE

\fBg.region raster\*=soils\fR
.RS
This form will make the current region settings exactly the same as those
given in the cell header file for the raster map layer \fIsoils\fR.
.RE

\fBg.region raster\*=soils zoom\*=soils\fR
.RS
This form will first look up the cell header file for the raster map layer
\fIsoils\fR, use this as the current region setting,
and then shrink the region down to the smallest region which
still encompasses all non-zero data in the map layer \fIsoils\fR.
Note that if the parameter \fIraster\*=soils\fR were not specified,
the zoom would move to encompass all non-zero data values in the soils map
that were located within the current region setting.
.RE

\fBg.region \-up raster\*=soils\fR
.RS
The \-u option suppresses the re-setting of the current region definition.
This can be useful
when it is desired to only extract region information.  In this case,
the cell header file for the soils map layer is printed without changing the
current region settings.
.RE

\fBg.region \-u raster\*=soils zoom\*=soils save\*=soils\fR
.RS
This will zoom into the smallest region which encompasses all non-zero
soils data values, and save the new region settings in a file to be called
\fIsoils\fR and stored under the \fIwindows\fR directory in the user's
current mapset.
The current region settings are not changed.
.RE

\fBg.region \-p\fR
.RS
This will print the current region in the format:

.in +5
.TS
l l.
projection:	1 (UTM)
zone:	15
north:	4294050.00
south:	4249950.00
east:	526050.00
west:	500950.00
nsres:	100.00
ewres:	100.00
rows:	441
cols:	251
.TE
.in
.RE

\fBg.region \-g\fR
.RS
The \-g option prints the region in the following format:

.in +5
.nf
n\*=4294050.00
s\*=4249950.00
e\*=526050.00
w\*=500950.00
nsres\*=100.00
ewres\*=100.00
.fi
.in

This format does not have the rows and columns, but can be fed back into
\fIg.region\fR on its command line.

The \-p (or \-g) option is recognized last.  This means that all changes
are applied to the region settings before printing occurs.
.RE
.SH NOTE
After all updates have been applied, the current region's southern
and western boundaries
are (silently) adjusted so that the north/south distance is a multiple
of the north/south resolution and that the east/west distance is a multiple
of the east/west resolution.
