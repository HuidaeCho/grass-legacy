Wishlist for GRASS 5

Configure:

  (Being worked on by )

- extended "autoconf" for entire package
  (Being worked on by )

Libraries:
- src/libes/gis/readsites.c: Required is a new function which allows
  to read an attribute/dimension selectable by user. Useful 
  in order to select which attribute to be converted 
  (assuming multi-attribute sites lists).
  (Being worked on by Markus)

- projection datum support for maps
  (Being worked on by Andreas Lange)

- new 3D vector format: evetually http://gts.sourceforge.net/ ??
  (Being worked on by )

Package:
- split into packages: GRASS-CORE, GRASS-Raster, ...
  (Being worked on by )
- release import/export routines separately under LGPL

Modules:
- r.buffer: should save info about used buffers into map history
  (Being worked on by )

- etc/monitorcap: use relative paths based on $GISBASE
  (Being worked on by )

- fix s.to.rast and s.to.vect to accept site lists created
  by r.to.sites
  (Being worked on by Markus)

- NVIZ:
    - Z axis scalable when displaying 3D sites
      (Being worked on by )

    - eventually color problem in lat/long locations
      (Being worked on by )

    - high resolution output (definable extent like CELL driver)
      (Being worked on by )

    - fix legend, scale and box drawings

- v.out.e00: make it working
  (Being worked on by Michel Wurtz)

- r.out.e00: write it
  (Being worked on by Michel Wurtz)

- Reorganize initialization routines and write a Tcl/Tk interface
  for initialization
  (Being worked on by Justin)

- Change the Grass monitor font system to use system fonts for
  X windows and/or Windows
  (Being worked on by )

- Create a Tcl/Tk interface for v.digit
  (Being worked on by Justin)

- Change the tcltkgrass code so that lists of choices appear as
  a list instead of needing to use a push button to create the
  list. For example when using d.rast we must click a "Raster"
  button to get a list of raster files instead of having the
  raster files appear automatically when we call the d.rast
  module from the menu
