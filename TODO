TODO for GRASS GIS:

See ONGOING for ONGOING GRASS projects.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wishlist for GRASS 5
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fix the bugs described in BUGS

Configure:
- update missing features in "configure" (see src/CMD/head/head.in)
     - search for PQLIB, PQINCPATH: PostgreSQL stuff
     - search for PNGINC, PNGLIB: PNG graphics library
     - search for TIFFINCPATH, TIFFLIBPATH
     - search for JPEGINCPATH, JPEGLIBPATH
     - search for MESA (usr/include or usr/include/GL ?)
     - libg2c is required to make r.fill.dir, but configure doesn't check 
       for it's availability
     - search for "yacc" and "(f)lex"
     - search, if odbc driver lib is present (src/libes/dbms/drivers/odbc/)
  (Being worked on by )


--------------------------------------------------------------------
Removal of absolute path codings:
 - etc/monitorcap:
   Here the paths should be replaced by $GISBASE environment

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Regression test suite:
 There are already some testing programs in the source code (e. g.               
 src/libes/gis/TESTS, src/libes/datetime/tests). Not a real regression           
 testing suite, but may be good as a starting point.   
 A testgrass.sh is stored in this directory. Please add further test
 routines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Font selection:
- add truetype support (replace old font system). This is urgently required
  for internationalization. Suggestion: Use "FreeType"
  http://freetype.sourceforge.net
  (Being worked on by )

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple languages support:

- depends on truetype support
- learn from KDE/GNOME etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Libraries:
- src/libes/gis/readsites.c: Required is a new function which allows
  to read an attribute/dimension selectable by user. Useful 
  in order to select which attribute to be converted 
  (assuming multi-attribute sites lists).
  (Being worked on by Markus, assistance wanted)

- new 3D vector format: evetually http://gts.sourceforge.net/ ??
  (Being worked on by )

- TIN support: Probably use this library:
    http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html
  (Being worked on by )

- Metadata: improved support, probably write a GRASS daemon serving
  the metadata for external applications like "R" statistics interface

- Parallel CPU support

---------------------------------------------------------------------
CELL driver
- update to 24bit
  (Being worked on by )                  

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Package:
- split into packages: GRASS-CORE, GRASS-Raster, ...
  (Being worked on by )

- reorganize directory structure

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lock system:

Comment:
Some lockfiles have to be global, just think of the number of
graphic display pipes used or physical inputs devices.
So two ways from there to improve the situation:
 
      Make the locking executables setgid or setuid.
      (and have just one executable doing the locking.)
      And/or use the /tmp directory.
 
      Localise all global lockable resources.
      (Unlikely to work.)
 Bernhard

- this might be related to a daemnon serving a session key (see there).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Modules:

-IMPORT/EXPORT modules:
  They should read/write from current directory instead of subdirectory
  in mapset.
  v.in.shape/v.out.shape and m.in.e00 already meet this convention.

- g.manual: change list of manual pages in g.manual
  organized according to objects (vector files, raster files, ...)
  not to "status" of module (which is even confused at time)
  (Being worked on by )

- ps.map:
  set CC option "-fwritable-strings" on Linux or, better, update ps.map!
  (Being worked on by )

- r.buffer: should save info about used buffers into map history
  (Being worked on by )

- etc/monitorcap: use relative paths based on $GISBASE
  (Being worked on by Justin)

- fix s.to.rast and s.to.vect to accept site lists created
  by r.to.sites
  (Being worked on by Eric Mitchell?)

- v.buffer: write it
  (Being worked on by)

- v.digit:
   Label: M- multiple un-label: it would be a good idea to first select
          all lines/areas, then confirmation *once* only

- NVIZ:
    - Z axis scalable when displaying 3D sites
      (Being worked on by )

    - eventually color problem in lat/long locations
      (Being worked on by )

    - high resolution output (definable extent like CELL driver)
      (Being worked on by 
       probably Bob Covill <bcovill@tekmap.ns.ca>)

    - fix legend, scale and box drawings


- tcltkgrass:
  Change the tcltkgrass code so that lists of choices appear as
  a list instead of needing to use a push button to create the
  list. For example when using d.rast we must click a "Raster"
  button to get a list of raster files instead of having the
  raster files appear automatically when we call the d.rast
  module from the menu (edit gui.tcl)
