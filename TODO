TODO for GRASS GIS:

- Fix the bugs in documents/know_bugs.list


Wishlist for GRASS 5

Configure:
- update missing features in "configure" (see src/CMD/head/head.in)
- extended "autoconf" for entire package

Libraries:
- src/libes/gis/sites.c: Required is a new function which allows
  to read an attribute/dimension selectable by user. This function
  is needed for s.to.rast in order to select which attribute shall
  be converted (assuming multi-attribute sites lists).

- projection datum support for maps

- new 3D vector format: evetually http://gts.sourceforge.net/ ??

Package:
- split into packages: GRASS-CORE, GRASS-Raster, ...


Modules:
- r.buffer: should save info about used buffers into map history

- etc/monitorcap: use relative paths based on $GISBASE

- fix s.to.rast and s.to.vect to accept site lists created
  by r.to.sites

- NVIZ:
    - Z axis scalable when displaying 3D sites
    - eventually color problem in lat/long locations
    - high resolution output (definable extent like CELL driver)

- v.out.e00: write it
- r.out.e00: as well or m.out.e00
