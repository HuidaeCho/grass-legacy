TODO for GRASS GIS:

- Fix the bugs described in BUGS

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wishlist for GRASS 5
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Configure:
- update missing features in "configure" (see src/CMD/head/head.in)
     - search for PQLIB, PQINCPATH: PostgreSQL stuff
     - search for PNGINC, PNGLIB: PNG graphics library
     - search for TIFFINCPATH, TIFFLIBPATH
     - search for JPEGINCPATH, JPEGLIBPATH
     - search for MESA (usr/include or usr/include/GL ?)
     - libg2c is required to make r.fill.dir, but configure doesn't check 
       for it's availability
     - search for "yacc" and "(f)lex"
  (Being worked on by )

- extended "autoconf" for entire package (new Makefiles)
  (Being worked on by Eric Mitchell <emitchell@altaira.com>)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Regression test suite:
 There are already some testing programs in the source code (e. g.               
 src/libes/gis/TESTS, src/libes/datetime/tests). Not a real regression           
 testing suite, but may be good as a starting point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Font selection:
- add truetype support (replace old font system). This is urgently required
  for internationalization. Suggestion: Use "FreeType"
  http://freetype.sourceforge.net
  (Being worked on by )

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Libraries:
- src/libes/gis/readsites.c: Required is a new function which allows
  to read an attribute/dimension selectable by user. Useful 
  in order to select which attribute to be converted 
  (assuming multi-attribute sites lists).
  (Being worked on by Markus, assistance wanted)

- projection datum support for maps
  (Being worked on by Andreas Lange)

- new 3D vector format: evetually http://gts.sourceforge.net/ ??
  (Being worked on by )


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Package:
- split into packages: GRASS-CORE, GRASS-Raster, ...
  (Being worked on by )
- release import/export routines separately under LGPL


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Modules:
- r.buffer: should save info about used buffers into map history
  (Being worked on by )

- etc/monitorcap: use relative paths based on $GISBASE
  (Being worked on by )

- fix s.to.rast and s.to.vect to accept site lists created
  by r.to.sites
  (Being worked on by Markus)

- NVIZ:
    - Z axis scalable when displaying 3D sites
      (Being worked on by )

    - eventually color problem in lat/long locations
      (Being worked on by )

    - high resolution output (definable extent like CELL driver)
      (Being worked on by )

    - fix legend, scale and box drawings

- v.out.e00: make it working
  (Being worked on by Michel Wurtz)

- r.out.e00: write it
  (Being worked on by Michel Wurtz)

- Reorganize initialization routines and write a Tcl/Tk interface
  for initialization
  (Being worked on by Justin)

- Create a Tcl/Tk interface for v.digit
  (Being worked on by Justin)

- Change the tcltkgrass code so that lists of choices appear as
  a list instead of needing to use a push button to create the
  list. For example when using d.rast we must click a "Raster"
  button to get a list of raster files instead of having the
  raster files appear automatically when we call the d.rast
  module from the menu (edit gui.tcl)
  (Being worked on by )

- ps.map:
  set CC option "-fwritable-strings" on Linux or, better, update ps.map!
  (Being worked on by )
