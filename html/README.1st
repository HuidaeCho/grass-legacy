This directory contains the GRASS 5 MAN pages
in HTML format. Please use the style you find
in existing module descriptions.

To create MAN-formatted files, you
g.html2man script within GRASS. Move the
MAN-page to ../man/man[12345] then.
The ../cats/.. files are created during GRASS
compilation.

Upload all files HTML, MAN and CAT to CVS
finally.

Please take care for HTML links within the files.
