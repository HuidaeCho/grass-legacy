This directory contains the GRASS 5 MAN pages
in HTML format. Please use the style you find
in existing module descriptions or in "template.ht".

To create MAN-formatted files, use the Gmakefile or
run g.html2man script :
Usage : g.html2man <html filename> <man filename> <1>

The man directories are created during GRASS compilation.

Find the g.html2man at:
../src/scripts/contrib/g.html2man/g.html2man

Please take care for HTML links within the files.

The best way for creating a new page is to use the
script makemanpage.sh from this directory and to
answer all the questions.  The program runs automaticaly
the editor of your choice ($EDITOR by default, if
$EDITOR doesn't exist, use netscape -edit instead)
once you have finished. Just replace some example
in SYNOPSYS and OPTIONS, and write some new paragraph
to explain your program.

-------------------------------------------------
TODO (11/2000) :

- reorganize man page in man/man1 man/man2 etc...
- give here some rules for writing HTML man pages
  (what command to use...)
- upgrade g.html2man for handling tables
