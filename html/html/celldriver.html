<EM><B>CELL driver</B></EM>  - driver to redirect graphical output into a
raster map<BR>
<EM>(drivers)</EM>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
The CELL driver can be used to redirect the output of the GRASS monitor into
a raster map. Features are:

<ul>
<li> storing graphical output into a file with better resolution than
through screen grabbing.
<li>saving 3-dimensional output from d.3d or other display programs 
to a <i>D_cell</i> raster map.
<li>saving display overlays (raster/raster/vector/...) to a file for high
resolution export with r.out.tiff or similar
</ul>

The user will find a <i>D_cell</i> raster file in GRASS database  after starting
the driver and using d.rast, d.vect etc. and finally stopping the driver
again. The <i>D_cell</i> raster file is written during closing procedure
(this may require some time according to the selected resolution).<br>

Then the user can export this file through r.out.tiff etc. for use in
external mapping software.<p>

Be aware that <i>D_cell</i> map is in a xy-projection which may differ to the
current location's projection.
So the <i>D_cell</i> map cannot be directly displayed on a GRASS monitor.

<h2>Usage in details</h2>

<ul>
<li>Set the map size for the CELL driver:
<ul>
<dd><tt>export GRASS_WIDTH=xxx</tt> &nbsp;&nbsp; (default is 640)
<dd><tt>export GRASS_HEIGHT=yyy</tt> &nbsp;&nbsp; (default is 480)<br>
<dd>If "export" command is not accepted by your shell, use "setenv" instead:
<dd><tt> setenv GRASS_WIDTH xxx</tt>
<dd><tt> setenv GRASS_HEIGHT yyy</tt>
</ul>
<li>Start the CELL driver:
<dd><tt> d.mon start=CELL</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait for "Ready" message (may
                                                  take some time due to the
                                                  file size selected)
<li>Now the user can work with the common display modules:
<dd><tt>d.zzzz (d.rast, d.vect, d.3d,...)</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that an
eventually started GRASS monitor won't display anything as the output is
redirected to <i>D_cell</i> file.
<li>Stop the CELL driver (and write <i>D_cell</i> file):
<dd><tt>d.mon stop=CELL</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that this may require some
time.
<li>To export the<i>D_cell</i> file, re-set the region:
<dd><tt>g.region raster=D_cell</tt>
<dd>Use the r.out.* export module.
</ul>
