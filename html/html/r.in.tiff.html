<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>r.in.tiff</b></EM>  - Imports a TIFF (8 or 24 bit) raster file into GRASS raster file(s).

<BR>

<EM>(GRASS Raster Data Import Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>


<B>r.in.tiff </b>[<b>-vb</b>] 
	<b>input=</b><em>name</em> <b>output=</b><em>name</em>
	[<B>nlev=</B><EM>value</EM>]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program imports a TIFF raster file (8 or 24 bit) to GRASS raster file(s).
Output is placed in the <EM>/cell</EM> directory
under the user's current GRASS mapset.
<p>
<H3>Flag:</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>-v</B>
<DD>Verbose mode</DD>

<DT><B>-b</B>
<DD>Import TrueColor (24 bit) TIFF into separate red, blue, and green bands. 
Each band file will be named <em>output</em>.[r|b|g] depending on the band.
</DL>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>input=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Name of an existing TIFF raster file to be imported. 
<DT><B>output=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Name to be assigned to resultant binary raster map layer. 
<DT><B>nlev=</B><EM>value</EM>
<DD>Optionally specify the number of colors per band for TrueColor 
TIFF files.<BR>
<B>Options:</B> 1 - 256<BR>
<B>Default:</B> 20 (8000 colors)
</DL>



<P>

The program prompts the user to enter the name of the TIFF raster file to be
converted and the name to be assigned to the GRASS raster file
to contain the resultant image. Currently "TIFF/uncompressed", 
"TIFF/PackBits-compression" and "TIFF/deflate" formats are supported.  Other
compression schemes may not be read correctly.
LZW compression is not supported due to UNISYS patent.

<P>
If a TIFF World file exists with an extension of "tfw", "tifw", "TFW",
or "TIFW", it will be used to set the boundary coordinates and cell size. 
Rotation in the TIFF World file is not supported (second and third numbers).
If no TIFF World file exists, the user should adjust boundary coordinates
stored in the cell header after import using <EM> <A
HREF="r.support.html">r.support</A> </EM>.
<p>

A sample TFW file opened up would look like: 

<pre> 
                       6.00 
                       0.00 
                       0.00 
                      -6.00 
                 1709053.00 
                  807714.00 

         Line 1 - Cell size in the "X" direction 
         Line 2 - Rotation term for the row 
         Line 3 - Rotation term for the column
         Line 4 - Cell size in the "Y" direction 
         Line 5 - Easting value of insertion point "X" 
         Line 6 - Northing value of insertion point "Y" 
</pre>

Note: The y-scale (E) is negative because the origins of an image and a
geographic coordinates system are different. The origin of an image is
located in the upper-left corner, whereas the origin of the map coordinate
system is located in the lower-left corner. Row values in the image increase
from the origin downward, while y-coordinate values in the map increase from
the origin upward.


<H2>NOTE</H2>

For non-*nix Operating Systems, the TIFF World file may not be found
if it's under a directory tree that has one of ".tfw", ".tifw", ".TFW" or
".TIFW".  Also, be aware that the TIFF World file is a text file.  Therefore,
if it has come from an operating system with a different idea about the
end of line character(s), it may not be read properly.  The input routine
expects each entry on a separate line.  Scripts like dos2unix can be used
to fixed this.
