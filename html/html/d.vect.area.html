<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>map</B>
<DD>Name of existing vector map to be displayed

<DT><B>color</B>
<DD>Color desired for filling polygons. May be specified as a standard
grass color name, or as an RGB triplet (e.g. 80:198:255).
<DD>Default: white

<DT><B>linecolor</B>
<DD>Color desired for drawing area boundaries.  May be specified as a
standard grass color name, or as an RGB triplet (e.g. 127:127:127).
<DD>Default: black

<DT><B>legend</B>
<DD>Name of a legend file specifying what color to use for 
each category (see below). If "-" is specified, the legend
will be read from standard input.
<DD>Default: none
</DL>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Use <EM>d.vect.area</EM> to draw labelled areas from a vector map to the GRASS
display.  Using, the "<EM>-r</EM>" flag, the program will cycle through the
standard GRASS named colors, overriding any <EM>color</EM> or
<EM>linecolor</EM> argument.  If a <EM>legend</EM> file is specified, it will
be used.  Otherwise, the color used for filling areas is as specified.

<P>

The <EM>color</EM> argument may be any of the standard named GRASS colors,
or and RGB (red, green, blue) triplet.  An RGB triplet must have the
form <EM>&lt;num&gt;:&lt;num&gt;:&lt;num&gt;</EM> where <EM>num</EM> is
between 0 and 255.
<P>

The <EM>linecolor</EM> argument is used in conjunction with the
<EM>color</EM> argument for drawing boundaries and has the
same format.

<P>
More control can be had by creating a <EM>legend</EM> file.  At the
time of this writing, GRASS does not have any management functions
for specifying how vectors should be drawn, so this file must be
created by "hand".  The easiest way to create such a file, is
to copy the category file for the vector map, and edit it to
contain color specifications.  The format of the <EM>legend</EM>
file is <EM>category red green blue [red green blue]</EM>,
with one entry per line.  The first RGB color specifies the fill
color, while the optional second one specifies the boundary
line color.
If a category for a map is not included
in this file, it will not be drawn unless there is a special "default"
entry with a category of -1.  Boundary lines are not drawn unless
either a boundary color is specified for the category, or there is
a default boundary color.

<DL>
<DT><B>Example Legend File</B>
<DD>
-1 255 255 255 127 127 127<BR>
1  210 198 168<BR>
5  168 198 220<BR>
</DL>

<P>

In the above, all labelled areas will be drawn in white (255, 255, 255)
with dark gray boundaries (127, 127, 127)
except those labelled as categories 1 or 5.  If the "default" entry
had been omitted, then only areas labelled 1 or 5 would have been drawn.
Since the entries for 1 and 5 don't specify a color for boundary lines,
no boundary lines are drawn.

<P>
One may place comments on any line in the legend file by starting it
with a non-numeric character ('#' is a good choice).  Empty lines
are ignored.

<H2>NOTES</H2>
<P>
It is expected that the legend specification aspect of this module
will change when an infrastructure for managing vector drawing
styles is implemented.
