<DD>"Randomly" fill all areas by cycling through standard GRASS colors
</DL>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>map</B>
<DD>Name of existing vector map to be displayed

<DT><B>color</B>
<DD>Color desired for filling polygons. May be specified as a standard
grass color name, or as an RGB triplet (e.g. 80:198:255).
<DD>Default: white

<DT><B>legend</B>
<DD>Name of a legend file specifying what color to use for 
each category (see below).
<DD>Default: none
</DL>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Use <EM>d.vect.area</EM> to draw labelled areas from a vector map to the GRASS
display.  Using, the "<EM>-r</EM>" flag, the program will cycle through the
standard GRASS named colors, overriding any <EM>color</EM> argument.  If
a <EM>legend</EM> file is specified, it will be used.
Otherwise, the color used for filling areas is as specified.

<P>

The <EM>color</EM> argument may be any of the standard named GRASS colors,
or and RGB (red, green, blue) triplet.  An RGB triplet must have the
form <EM>&lt;num&gt;:&lt;num&gt;:&lt;num&gt;</EM> where <EM>num</EM> is
between 0 and 255.
<P>

More control can be had by creating a <EM>legend</EM> file.  At the
time of this writing, GRASS does not have any management functions
for specifying how vectors should be drawn, so this file must be
created by "hand".  The easiest way to create such a file, is
to copy the category file for the vector map, and edit it to
contain color specifications.  The format of the <EM>legend</EM>
file is <EM>category red green blue</EM>, with one entry per
line. If a category for a map is not included in this file,
it will not be drawn unless there is a special "default"
entry with a category of -1.  

<DL>
<DT><B>Example Legend File</B>
<DD>
-1 255 255 255<BR>
1  210 198 168<BR>
5  168 198 220<BR>
</DL>

<P>

In the above, all labelled areas will be drawn in white (255, 255, 255),
except those labelled as categories 1 or 5.  If the "default" entry
had been omitted, then only areas labelled 1 or 5 would have been drawn.

<H2>NOTES</H2>
<P>
The <EM>d.vect.area</EM> module does not draw boundary lines.  It only
flood fills areas.
<P>
It is expected that the legend specification aspect of this module
will change when an infrastructure for managing vector drawing
styles is implemented.

<H2>BUGS</H2>
It might be considered a bug, that malformed legend file entries
are silently dropped.  Only if no entries could be parsed, will
an error be raised.
