<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

When programs like digit delete lines, they do not really go away, but 
are simply marked as deleted. This is done primarily for speed. But 
a side effect is that vector files can end up carrying a lot of dead weight 
with them. 

<P>

<EM>v.clean</EM> will go through a vector file and remove all dead lines in 
the file thus potentially reducing the size of the file.

You do <EM>not</EM> have to run 
<EM><A HREF="v.support.html">v.support</A></EM> afterwards.
