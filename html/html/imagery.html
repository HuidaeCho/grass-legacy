<H2>IMAGE PROCESSING IN GRASS</H2>

The following discussion is intended to provide a quick overview of
image processing in GRASS.  Some concepts and some hints are provided.
For a more complete discussion and description of image processing in GRASS
see <EM>GRASS Tutorial: Image Processing</EM>.

<H2>EXTRACTING IMAGERY DATA INTO A GRASS DATABASE</H2>

Remotely sensed images are captured for computer processing
by filtering radiation emanating from the image into
various electromagnetic wavelength bands, converting the
overall intensity for each band to digital format, and
storing the values on computer compatible media such as
magnetic tape.


<P>

The GRASS programs which extract image data from magnetic tape
can read LANDSAT multi-spectral scanner (MSS) data 
(<EM><A HREF="i.tape.mss.html">i.tape.mss</A></EM>),
LANDSAT thematic mapper (TM) data, 
(<EM><A HREF="i.tape.tm.html">i.tape.tm</A></EM>),
and other formats, such as scanned aerial photography
or SPOT satellite data 
(<EM><A HREF="i.tape.other.html">i.tape.other</A></EM>).
They extract the band data into raster files in a GRASS database.
Each band becomes a separate raster file, with standard GRASS map
layer support, and can be displayed
and analyzed just like any other raster file.

<H2>UNREGISTERED DATA</H2>

The band data extracted from tapes are assumed to be
unregistered data.  This means that the GRASS software does
not know the earth coordinates for pixels in the image.
The only coordinates known at the time of extraction are
the columns and the rows relative to the way the data was
stored on the tape.


<P>

Data can only be extracted into a database which has an x,y
coordinate system, and not into a projected database (e.g.,
a UTM database).  This is to prevent users from mixing the
unregistered data with registered data in the same
database.  The GRASS system comes with the database
<EM>imagery</EM> which is an x,y database.  New databases
can be created by users during GRASS startup.  See the
<EM><A HREF="g.help.html">g.help</A></EM> 
section on "Setting Up a GRASS Database"
for instructions on creating a new database.

<H2>CELL HEADERS</H2>

The cell headers for the band files in these x,y databases
are set to reflect the rows and columns of the extracted
data.  The north-south values represent the rows, and the
east-west values represent the columns.  The resolution of
the unregistered data is set to 1.


<P>

Note, however, that while the row numbers increase from 1
to n from north to south, GRASS requires that the values of
the user's current geographic region decrease from north to
south.  The solution adopted was to represent the rows with
negative values (i.e., -1 to -n).  This allows them to
decrease from north to south and, if the minus sign is
ignored, to reflect the row numbers.


<P>

The cell headers for the layers in x,y databases are set so
that the coordinates at the center of each pixel exactly
reflect the row and column for that pixel.  The northern
edge is set to 0.5 less than the first row, the southern
edge 0.5 larger than the last row, the west to 0.5 less
than the first column, and the east to 0.5 larger than the
last column.  When the image is displayed on the graphics
monitor, the
<EM><A HREF="d.where.html">d.where</A></EM> 
command can be used to report row and column values.


<P>

For example, suppose rows 100-500 and columns 200-800 are extracted.
Then the cell headers for the extracted data will be given the following
values:


<DL>
<DD>
<PRE>
north:	-99.5
south:	-500.5
west:	199.5
east:	800.5
ns res:	1.0
ew res:	1.0
</PRE>
</DL>

<H2>REGION AND MASK</H2>

Since the data layers are given essentially contrived cell
headers, users must exercise extra care when analyzing or
displaying unregistered images.  It is very easy for the
user's GRASS region to have absolutely no relationship to
the data he is trying to display.  This could happen when
the region is set for data extracted from one tape, but the
analysis is attempted on data extracted from another tape.
A good habit to develop is to set the region to exactly
match one of the band files.  This can be done using the
GRASS 
<EM><A HREF="g.region.html">g.region</A></EM> command.


<P>

Another pitfall is to have a mask set to a band file from
one data set while trying to read another.  Even if the
region is set properly, the data will appear to be all
no-data since the mask will effectively knock out any
data.  Be sure that the mask is either set to a related
data layer or not set at all.  See
<EM><A HREF="r.mask.html">r.mask</A></EM>
for information on setting and unsetting the mask.


<P>

Please note that the tape extraction routines set your
database region to match the rows and columns of the data
that is extracted.

<H2>GROUPS</H2>

Since the band files are individual raster files, it is
necessary to have a mechanism to maintain a relationship
between band files from the same image as well as raster
files derived from the band files.  The GRASS
<EM>group</EM> data structure accomplishes this goal.  The
group is essentially a list of names of raster files that
belong in the group.  For user convenience, groups are also
created (and updated) by the tape extraction routines.  The
tape extraction programs ask the user to supply a group
name as well as to specify the bands to be extracted.
Suppose that the user extracts bands 1, 2, and 3 into a
group called <EM>nhap</EM>.  Then the band files will
become the raster files <EM>nhap.1</EM>, <EM>nhap.2</EM>,
and <EM>nhap.3</EM> and the group <EM>nhap</EM> will list
these 3 raster files as members of the group.


<P>

Groups can also
be created and modified by the user using the GRASS command
<EM><A HREF="i.group.html">i.group</A>.</EM>

<H2>IMAGE REGISTRATION AND RECTIFICATION</H2>

Image registration and image rectification is the process
of associating earth coordinates with pixels on the image
and then converting the unregistered raster files to raster
files in a projected database.


<P>

Image registration
(<EM><A HREF="i.points.html">i.points</A></EM>)
is applied to a group, rather than to individual raster
files.  The control points are stored in the group,
allowing all related band files to be registered in one
step rather than individually.


<P>

Image rectification
(<EM><A HREF="i.rectify.html">i.rectify</A></EM>)
is applied to individual raster files, with the control
points for the group used to control the rectification and
the group target 
(<EM><A HREF="i.target.html">i.target</A></EM>) 
used to specify the
database where the rectified layer will live.

<H2>IMAGE CLASSIFICATION</H2>

Image classification methods process all or a subset of the band files
as a unit. 
Spectral signatures for the image are generated
(<EM><A HREF="i.cluster.html">i.cluster</A></EM>)
and then used to produce a landcover map
(<EM><A HREF="i.maxlik.html">i.maxlik</A></EM>).


<P>

The signatures must be associated only with the raster files
actually used in the analysis. This means that with a group
<EM>subgroups</EM>
must be created
(<EM><A HREF="i.group.html">i.group</A></EM>)
which list the band files to be grouped for classification
purposes.  The signatures are stored with the subgroup.


<P>

Note that multiple subroups can be created within a group.  This allows
different classifications to be run with different combinations
of band files.


<P>

Also note that raster files produced by the classification process
(<EM><A HREF="i.maxlik.html">i.maxlik</A></EM>) are automatically listed as part of the group.

<H2>RECTIFIED VS. UNRECTIFIED ANALYSIS</H2>

There are two possible routes for processing image data.
The first is to register the group 
(<EM><A HREF="i.points.html">i.points</A></EM>),
perform the analyses on the unrectified band data 
(<EM><A HREF="i.maxlik.html">i.maxlik</A></EM>),
and then rectify the results 
(<EM><A HREF="i.rectify.html">i.rectify</A></EM>).
The second is to register the group 
(<EM><A HREF="i.points.html">i.points</A></EM>),
rectify the band data 
(<EM><A HREF="i.rectify.html">i.rectify</A></EM>),
then run analyses on the rectified band data
in the target location 
(<EM><A HREF="i.rectify.html">i.rectify</A></EM>).
Both routes are permissible in GRASS.
Users will most likely prefer the first.
The second route requires leaving GRASS and re-running
GRASS under the target location.  It also will require
that a group be created to hold the rectified band files since
<EM><A HREF="i.rectify.html">i.rectify</A></EM>
does not create or modify groups.
Also, spatial filtering may not be as effective on rectified data
since the rectification of the data requires resampling the original data.
