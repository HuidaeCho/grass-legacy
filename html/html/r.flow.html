<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
This program<B> </B>generates flowlines using a combined raster-vector
approach (see<A HREF="http://www2.gis.uiuc.edu:2280/modviz/papers/hmg.rev1.ps"> Mitasova and Hofierka
1993 </A>and <A HREF="http://www2.gis.uiuc.edu:2280/modviz/papers/ijgis.html">Mitasova et al. 1995)</A>) from an input
elevation raster map <I>elevin</I><B> </B>(integer or floating point),
and optionally an input aspect raster map <I>aspin</I> and/or an input
barrier raster map <I>barin</I>. There are three possible output maps which
can be produced in any combination simultaneously: a vector file <I>flout</I>
of flowlines, a raster map <I>lgout</I> of flowpath lengths, and a raster
map <I>dsout</I> of flowline densities (which are equal upslope contributed
areas per unit width, when multiplied by resolution).


<P>Aspect used for input must follow the same rules as aspect computed
in other GRASS programs (see <A HREF="s.surf.rst.html">s.surf.rst</A>
or <A HREF="r.slope.aspect.html">r.slope.aspect</A>).

<P>Flowline output is given in a vector map <I>flout</I>, (flowlines generated
downhill). The line segments of flowline vectors have endpoints on edges
of a grid formed by drawing imaginary lines through the centers of the
cells in the elevation map. Flowlines are generated from each cell downhill
by default; they can be generated uphill using the flag <I>-u</I>. A flowline
stops if its next segment would reverse the direction of flow (from up
to down or vice-versa), cross a barrier, or arrive at a cell with undefined
elevation or aspect. Another option, <I>skip</I>=val, indicates that only
the flowlines from every val-th cell are to be included in <I>flout</I>.
The default <I>skip</I> is max(1,&nbsp;&lt;rows in elevin&gt;/50,&nbsp;&lt;cols in elevin&gt;/50).
A high <I>skip</I> usually speeds up processing time and often improves
the readability of a visualization of <I>flout</I>.

<P>Flowpath length output is given in a raster map <I>lgout</I>. The value
in each grid cell is the sum of the planar lengths of all segments of the
flowline generated from that cell. If the flag <I>-3</I> is given, elevation
is taken into account in calculating the length of each segment.

<P>Flowline density downhill or uphill output is given in a raster map
<I>dsout.</I> The value in each grid cell is the number of flowlines which
pass through that grid cell, that means the number of flowlines from the
entire map which have segment endpoints within that cell.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>
The program will run non-interactively&nbsp; if the user specifies program
arguments and flag settings on the command line using the following form:

<P><B>r.flow [ -u3mMqh ] elevin </B>= name [ <B>aspin </B>= name ] [ <B>barin
</B>= name ] [ <B>skip </B>= val ] [ <B>bound </B>= val ] [ <B>offset </B>=
val ] [ <B>flout </B>= name ] [ <B>lgout </B>= name ] [ <B>dsout </B>=
name ].

<P>Alternatively, the user can simply type <B>r.flow</B> on the command
line and the program will ask for parameter values and flag settings interactively,
using the standard GRASS parser interface.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>Flags:</H3>
<B>-u</B> Generate flowlines uphill (default generates flowlines downhill).

<P><B>-3</B> Compute three-dimensional lengths (default is two-dimensional).

<P><B>-m</B> Use less memory and compute aspect at each cell on the fly.
This option incurs a severe performance penalty. If this flag is given,
the aspect input map (if any) will be ignored.

<P><B>-M</B> Use a fixed size memory and utilize page-swapping to handle
large input files. This option incurs a severe performance penalty but
is the only way to handle arbitrarily-large data files. If this flag is
given, the \fB-m\fR flag will be ignored.

<P><B>-q</B> Quiet operation. Do not print diagnostic messages indicating
progress.

<P><B>-h</B> Display reference information.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>Parameters:</H3>
<B>elevin</B>=<I>name</I>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the existing raster file name with elevations
as input (required).
<BR><B>aspin</B>=<I>name</I>

<BR><B>barin</B>=<I>name</I>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the existing raster file name with non-zero

<BR><B>skip</B>=<I>val</I>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set the number of cells between flowlines in the
<B>flout</B> output map to val.
<BR><B>bound</B>=<I>val</I>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set the maximum number of segments of each flowline
to val (default is the maximum possible).

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maximum magnitude of random grid point offset (default
is 0).

name.
<BR><B>lgout</B>=<I>name</I>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Output flowpath length values to a raster file name.
<BR><B>dsout</B>=<I>name</I>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Output flowline density values to a raster file
name.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>NOTES</H2>
For best results, use input elevation maps with high precision units (e.g.,
centimeters) so that flowlines do not terminate prematurely in flat areas.
To prevent the creation of tiny flowline segments with imperceivable changes
in elevation, an endpoint which would land very close to the center of
a grid cell is quantized to the exact center of that cell. The maximum
distance between the intercepts along each axis of a single diagonal segment
and another segment of 1/2 degree different aspect is taken to be "very
close" for that axis. Note that this distance (the so-called "quantization
error") is about 1-2% of the resolution on maps with square cells.

<P>The values in length maps computed using the <B>-u</B> flag represent
the distances from each cell to an upland flat or singular point. Such
distances are useful in water erosion modeling for computation of the LS
factor in the standard form of USLE. Uphill flowlines merge on ridge lines;
by redirecting the order of the flowline points in the output vector map,
dispersed waterflow can be simulated. The density map can be used for the
extraction of ridge lines.

<P>Computing the flowlines downhill simulates the actual flow (also known
as the raindrop method). These flowlines tend to merge in valleys; they
can be used for localization of areas with waterflow accumulation and for
the extraction of channels. The downslope flowline density multiplied by
the resolution can be used as an approximation of the upslope contributing
area per unit contour width. This area is a measure of potential water
flux for the steady state conditions and can be used in the modeling of
water erosion for the computation of the unit stream power based LS factor
or sediment transport capacity.

<P>The program has been designed for modeling erosion on hillslopes and
has rather strict conditions for ending flowlines. It is therefore not
very suitable for the extraction of stream networks or delineation of watersheds
unless a DEM without pits or flat areas is available.

<P> To label the vector flowlines automatically, the user can use
<a href=v.llabel.html>v.llabel</a>.

<H2>Algorithm background</H2> 

<P>1. Construction of flow-lines (slope-lines): r.flow uses an original
vector-grid algorithm which uses an infinite number of directions between
0.0000... and 360.0000...  and traces the flow as a line (vector) in the
direction of gradient (rather than from cell to cell in one of the 8
directions = D-infinity algorithm). They are traced in any direction using
aspect (so there is no limitation to 8 directions here). The D8 algorithm
produces zig-zag lines. The value in the outlet is very similar for both
r.flow and <a href=r.flowmd.html>r.flowmd</a> algorithms (because it is
essentially the watershed area), however the spatial distribution of flow,
especially on hillslopes is quite different. It is still a 1D flow routing
so the dispersal flow is not accurately described, but still better than D8.

<P>2. Computation of contributing areas: r.flow uses a single flow
algorithm, i.e. all flow is transported to a single cell downslope.

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2>
ERROR: GISRC - variable not set

<P>The program was run outside of GRASS.

<P>Usage: r.flow [-u3mMqh] elevin=name [aspin=name] [barin=name] [skip=value]
[bound=value] [offset=value] [flout=name] [lgout=name] [dsout=name]

<P>Invalid options were specified on the command line.

<P>ERROR: r.flow: error getting current region

<P>ERROR: r.flow: unable to reset current region

<P>ERROR: r.flow: cannot open vector file

<P>"ERROR: r.flow: cell file " filename " not found"

<P>"ERROR: r.flow: cannot get header for " filename

<P>"ERROR: r.flow: unable to create raster map " filename

<P>Self-explanatory or beyond explanation.

<P>"ERROR: r.flow: " input " file's resolution differs from current" region
resolution

<P>The resolutions of all input files and the current region must match.

<P>"ERROR: r.flow: resolution too unbalanced (" val " x " val ")" The difference
in length between the two axes of a grid cell is so great that quantization
error is larger than one of the dimensions. Resample the map and try again.
