<h2>Guidelines for AGNPS-GRASS Input Interface</h2>
<p>

The major objective of the AGNPS-GRASS input interface is to minimize the
user interaction in preparing the input data for the AGNPS
model and to
minimize the number of user supplied/developed GIS database layers. Of the 22
different data required by the model for each cell (appendix 2), the interface 
will prepare the input data with only 8 (appendix 2) basic GIS database layers
supplied by the user and with minimal user interaction. There are 5 (appendix 2)
parameters needed for the whole watershed which will be obtained from the user.
<p>
<B>Name of the AGNPS-GRASS Input Interface Program</B>: <EM>aggrs_input</EM>
<p>
<B>Procedures to follow while executing the Input Interface</B>:
<p>
First start GRASS 3.1 from a shelltool window with proper mapset where
the data resides
<p>
Execute <EM>aggrs_input</EM> program from the shelltool window where GRASS
is running
<p>
A <EM>Watershed Input</EM> menu will appear on the shelltool window requesting the following data/information from the user:
<p>
Watershed Description: Enter a description about the watershed. This information optional and will appear in both input and output of the AGNPS model run.
<p>
Rainfall Amount in inches: Enter the total amount of rainfall in inches.
<p>
Erosivity Index Value: Enter the erosivity index value for that particular storm/rainfall event.
<p>
Enter the cell size in meters: The length of the side of a cell in meters is entered. The square of the cell size will be the area of each cell.
<p>
Enter a file name to save in AGNPS format: Enter a file name with <EM>.dat</EM> as the extension to save the AGNPS model input file created by the AGNPS-GRASS 
input interface tool. This will be stored in the current working directory.
<p>
Enter the watershed name: The name of the watershed should be entered here.
All the input layers should have the same watershed name with the proper 
extension (as <EM>X</EM> in appendix 1). 
Please refer to appendix 1 for the valid extensions and valid category
labels/values that are allowed for each layer.
<p>
Then hit the <EM>Esc</EM> key to continue.


<P>

<p>
Error Messages: If any of the category labels/values for the input layers is not valid, an
error message is printed and the program quits. Run <EM>support</EM> on the layer
where the category label is wrong to correct it. The program <EM>support</EM>
helps to modify the supporting files of a map, which include header, category,
color, and history. The wrong/misspelled category labels can be corrected by 
running <EM>support</EM> on the layer to be corrected and choosing the category 
option. If there is any problem
with the flow direction layer, error messages are printed for
those cell numbers that had problems and the nature of those problems (like
circularity, sinks or holes, or flow directions pointing at each other).
Use <EM>Dedit</EM> on the aspect map to correct the problems. The <EM>Dedit</EM>
program helps to display and edit the aspect map with arrows on it, which should enable one
to correct the flow direction on a cell by cell basis.
<p>
For each run of this input interface tool, a new <EM>temp_cell_num</EM> layer is
created and stored in the current mapset. In this map, the cells are 
numbered from top to bottom and left to right. This is a useful 
layer for editing and interpreting the error messages due to conflicting flow 
direction for any particular cell. While using the <EM>Dedit</EM> program to
correct the errors, this map allows one to locate the cell number where 
conflicts occur.
<p>
Once the input interface completes its run without errors, it saves the data
in the AGNPS format. The AGNPS model can be executed with this data. The name
of the executable file program to run the AGNPS model is <EM>agrun</EM>.
Type <EM>agrun</EM> from the shelltool window where GRASS is running. The 
program will ask for the input file name. Enter the
name of the file that
was saved by running the AGNPS-GRASS input interface, with the <EM>.dat</EM> extension.
The model will output the results of the run with a <EM>.nps</EM> extension. Both
input and output ASCII files are needed to execute the AGNPS-GRASS output interface tool (the Visualization tool).

<p>

<DL>
<DT>Watershed boundary	
<BR>(<B>X</B>.wshd)

<DD> Should have category values greater than 0 within  the
watershed and 0's outside of the watershed boundary.

<DT>Elevation	
<BR>(<B>X</B>.elev)

<DD>Elevation data in meters should be the category values
for each cell. Also make sure at least 1 row and column of
data around the watershed boundary exists to estimate slope
and aspect at the boundary of the watershed.

<DT>Aspect	
<BR>(<B>X</B>.asp.cell_size)

<DD>The aspect map should have values between <EM>1-8</EM>
as category values  and should not have any sinks,
circularity or more than one outlet. Cell_size is the
number that the user entered for question 4 in the
interface input menu.  For example, if the watershed is
modeled for a 100 meter cell size, then the aspect map name
should be <B>X</B>.asp.100

<DT>Soils	
<BR>(<B>X</B>.soils)

<DD>If any of the soil attribute (K factor, clay, sand or
hydrological soil group) maps do not exist, then the
program looks for <B>X</B>.soils map to extract information
from the Soils-5 data base. (currently this is not working
fully).
<DT>USLE K factor	
<BR>(<B>X</B>.K)

<DD>The USLE K factor map should contain the value of the K
factor as the category label for each cell. This is
obtained from the soil type map.

<DT>Hydrological soil group	
<BR>(<B>X</B>.hyg)

<DD>The category labels allowed are either <EM>A</EM>,
<EM>B</EM>, <EM>C</EM>, or <EM>D</EM> and should appear as
category labels for each cell. This is obtained from the
soil type map.

<DT>Sand	
<BR>(<B>X</B>.sand)

<DD>The percentage of sand content should be the category
label for each cell.  This is obtained from the soil type
map.

<DT>Clay	
<BR>(<B>X</B>.clay)

<DD>The percentage of clay content should be there as a
category label for each cell. This is obtained from the
soil type map.

<BR>(<B>X</B>.mgpr)

<DD>The management practice map category labels allowed are
<EM>straight row</EM>, <EM>contoured</EM>, or <EM>contoured
and terraced</EM>.

<DT>Nutrient	
<BR>(<B>X</B>.nut)

<DD>The cell value should correspond to the level of
fertilizer application, i.e <EM>1</EM>, <EM>2</EM>,
<EM>3</EM> or <EM>0</EM>. Where 1-low, 2-medium, 3-high and
0-urban, water or marsh.  (refer 
<A HREF="#fert">fertilizer level table</A>).

<DD>A channel slope length map has to be prepared by the
user.  Percentage of channel slope should be the value of
the category in that cell. If this layer is missing, the
user has the choice to either enter the name of layer which
has the channel slope values or can accept the default
value of 50% of the overland slope value as the channel
slope value (recommended by the AGNPS manual).

<DT>Slope length factor

</PRE>
The 8 basic input GIS layers required for extracting the
data by the AGNPS-GRASS input interface tool are:

<OL>
<LI>Soils
<LI>Elevation
<LI>Land use
<LI>Management practice
<LI>Fertilizer or nutrient inputs
<LI>Type of machinery used for land preparation
<LI>Channel slope 
<LI>Slope length factor
</OL>

Five pieces of data are required for the total watershed:
<OL>
<LI> Watershed identification/description
<LI> Precipitation (inches)
<LI> Erosion Index (EI-value) for that storm/rainfall event
<LI> Area of each cell (acres)
<LI> Outlet cell number
</OL>

An important implication of this set is that AGNPS does
<STRONG>not</STRONG> accommodate non-uniform storms,
<EM>i.e.</EM> it uses a lumped modeling approach for its
rainfall.

<P>

For each watershed element, AGNPS requires the following 22
input data values (its distributed parameter information):

<OL>
<LI> Cell number
<LI> Number of the cell into which it drains
<LI> SCS curve number
<LI> Average land slope (%)
<LI> Slope shape factor (uniform, convex or concave)
<LI> Average field slope length (feet)
<LI> Average channel slope (%)
<LI> Average channel side slope (%)
<LI> Mannings roughness coefficient for the channel
<LI> Soil erodibility factor (K) for USLE
<LI> Cropping factor (C) for USLE
<LI> Practice factor (P) for USLE
<LI> Surface condition constant (factor based on land use)
<LI> Aspect (one of 8 possible directions indicating the principal 
     drainage direction from the cell)
<LI> Soil texture (sand, silt, clay, peat)
<LI> Fertilization level (zero, low, medium, high)
<LI> Incorporation factor (% fertilizer left in top 1 cm of soil)
<LI> Point source indicator (indicates existence of a
     point source input within a cell)
<LI> Gully source level (estimate of amount, tons, of gulley 
     erosion in a cell)
<LI> Chemical oxygen demand factor
<LI> Impoundment factor (indicating the presence of an
     impoundment terrace system within the cell)
<LI> Channel indicator (indicating existence of a defined
