for the Identification Section of the PL94 file.  Other<BR>
parameters are not necessary and will be ignored.

<DT><B>-n</B>
<DD>Output only the sequential number and PL94 logical record<BR>
number (LOGRECNU) of matching records to stdout.

<B>Parameters:</B>
<DL>
<DT><B>sc=</B><EM>string</EM>
<DD>sc is starting column or a capitilized reference name from
                  the Identification Section of the PL94 Data Dictionary;
                  string is characters to match there.  A negative test may
                  also be made with: sc!=string.  If more than one test is
                  specified the results are "anded" resulting in a
		  conjunction of the results of the expressions.  (See 
		  <EM>m.in.stf1.tpe</EM> for complete details.)

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



<P>

This program is provided to read the Census PL94 data records
from a file for one state.  The file is usually on a CD-ROM, but
this is not necessary providing the proper path is given for the <EM>in=</EM>
parameter and the contents of the file duplicate that on CD-ROM.


<P>

The output consists of records of 517 characters extracted from the
input file with a suitable line termination character added (\n) to
create a normal text file.


<P>

Users of GRASS 4.1 and the Census PL94 files on CD-ROM will generally use
this program to select appropriate subsets of PL94 records; write them to
one or more files; and then either process these files
directly with <EM>
<A HREF="v.apply.census.html">v.apply.census</A>
</EM> to print demographics, create site maps or label
vector maps, or use <EM>m.in.stf1.tpe</EM> to extract further subsets.


<P>

The PL94 CD-ROM data file for most states is very large, 100+ MB.  This
program may take 20 to 60 minutes for a single extraction, so plan carefully
and don't discard useful subsets that you create on disk.


<P>


<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

Insert the appropriate CD-ROM and mount it (see your system administrator).
(We assume here that it is mounted as the file system /cdrom.)
<P>
To extract all Census tract summary records for the state of South Dakota:
<P>
<DL>
<DD><B>m.in.pl94.db3 -p </B><EM>11=050</EM> <B>in=</B><EM>/cdrom/pl9417sd.dbf &gt; counties.sd</EM>
</DL>

<P>

The 11=050 parameter selects those records which have the character string
'050' beginning in column 11 of the assembled records.  Columns 11-13 are the 
Summary Level (SUMLEV) field which is used in almost every selection from
CD-ROM.
<P>
To extract all block records for Lawrence County, South Dakota:
<P>
<DL>
<DD><B>m.in.pl94.db3 -p </B><EM>SUMLEV=100 CNTY=081</EM> <B>in=</B><EM>/cdrom/pl9417sd.dbf &gt; bk.081.sd</EM>
</DL>
<P>
100 is the SUMLEV for blocks and 081 is the county code for Lawrence Co.
<P>

<H2>SEE ALSO</H2>

<EM>m.in.stf1.tpe</EM> is used as a post-processor to select further subsets of
PL94 records.  NOTE: Unix utility programs, such as <EM>grep</EM> or <EM>awk</EM>,
can also be used for the for processing the extracted PL94 files.
