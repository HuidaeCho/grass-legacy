<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>d.zoom</b></EM>  - Allows the user to change the current geographic region 
settings interactively, with a mouse. 
<BR>
<EM>(GRASS Display Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>d.zoom</B>
<BR>
<B>d.zoom help</B> 
<BR>
<B>d.zoom</B> [<B>-q</B>] [<B>action=</B><EM>name</EM>] 
<BR>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>d.zoom</EM> allows the user to interactively adjust the settings 
of the current geographic region using a pointing device such as 
a mouse. 
Like <EM><A HREF="g.region.html">g.region</A></EM>, 
<EM>d.zoom</EM> re-defines the settings of the geographic
region.  However, <EM>d.zoom</EM> allows the user to change
the current region settings interactively, by either
outlining the new region perimeter with a mouse
or "rotating" latitude-longitude data into the current region. 
The user should run 
<EM><A HREF="d.erase.html">d.erase</A></EM> 
after <EM>d.zoom</EM> is run for the 
new region settings to affect the graphics display. 

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<H3>Flag:</H3> 

<DL>
<DT><B>-q</B>

<DD>Run quietly, suppressing output of some program
messages to standard output.

</DL>

<H3>Parameter:</H3> 

<DL>
<DT><B>action=</B><EM>name</EM>

<DD>Allows the user to change the geographic region
settings by "rotating" the globe to move a different
portion of the globe into the stationery boxed region
outline (making this new portion of the globe the new
current region), rather than by moving the boxed region
outline.  This option can only be used with
latitude-longitude data bases (although <EM>d.zoom</EM>
will not complain if the user attempts to set this
parameter while running on a non-latitude-longitude data
base).

<BR>
Options: zoom, rotate 

</DL>

After the user types the command <B>d.zoom</B> and
(optionally) sets the <B>-q</B> flag and type of zoom to be
performed, a mouse-button menu will appear, directing the
user to: establish the corners of the new geographic
region, check its coordinates, and confirm any changes
made.  When the user accepts new geographic boundaries,
<EM>d.zoom</EM> asks,

<DL>
<DD>
Accept new region? Y / N  &gt;
</DL>

If the user clicks the mouse over the "Y" (yes), 
the mouse-drawn geographic region is saved as the user's 
current geographic region. The user is warned that 
<EM><A HREF="d.erase.html">d.erase</A></EM> should 
be run after <EM>d.zoom</EM> to make new current region settings affect 
the graphics display. 

<P>

If the user clicks the mouse over the "N" (no), the first mouse-drawn 
geographic region is not saved; instead, <EM>d.zoom</EM> asks whether or not 
the user wishes to 

<DL>
<DD>
Try Again? Y / N  &gt;
</DL>

The user can then opt to draw a new region with the mouse
("Y"), or opt to exit <EM>d.zoom</EM> ("N") and leave
current region settings unchanged.

<P>

To zoom-out to a larger area than was windowed-in on with <EM>d.zoom</EM> 
(i.e., to enlarge the current geographic region), 
the user may run <EM><A HREF="g.region.html">g.region</A></EM>.
The user may also alter the current geographic region by running the "region" 
option of the <EM><A HREF="d.display.html">d.display</A></EM> program. 

<H2>NOTES</H2>

Although it is not necessary that the user display a map in
the active display frame before running <EM>d.zoom</EM>, it
is helpful to do this for reference.

<P>

Currently, the rubber-banded boundaries of the zoom region drawn by 
the user are not clearly visible on the graphics monitor. However, 
whether or not these boundaries are clearly visible when drawn, 
the drawn region is still correctly zoomed-in on.
