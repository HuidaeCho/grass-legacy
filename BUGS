For the forthcoming GRASS 5 stable release there are some bugs
being release-critical. They are indicated [RC].

----------- drivers ---------------------------------------------
[RC] CELL-Driver: colors are not correct
   Comment from Carl Anderson <candrsn@mindspring.com>
    Tracking of the "bug" will have to start in
    src/display/d.rast/cmd/display.c
    Since GRASS4 did the colors right, using both GRASS4 and GRASS5
    drivers, I suspect one of the Libraries and not the XDRIVER.
    look at D_set_colors ().

 Markus,
  briefly, the problem might be in cache modes. The functions G3d_getValue () should be 
  used in a cache mode, however, we open maps using non-cache mode:
  map = G3d_openCellOld(input, G_find_grid3(input, ""), G3D_DEFAULT_WINDOW,
   G3D_TILE_SAME_AS_FILE,
   G3D_NO_CACHE);

  Please try to change G3D_NO_CACHE parameter to G3D_USE_CACHE_DEFAULT, and 
  re-compile main.c for r3.out.ascii with G3d_getWindow() and G3d_getValue() 
  commands or previous version of r3.out.v5d. Currently I have not enough 
  time to try it.

----------- modules ---------------------------------------------
[RC] d.his: 
 - color wrong if input value=0
 - added NULL randomly when using "out" for saving
 - not MASK sensitive
    (being worked on by ?)

d.mon: hangs with "-L" option
   (would be nice to fix to improve "d.monsize" script
  Andreas Lange wrote:
  The d.mon -L bug only occurs on Linux, on IRIX
  everything is ok. I read the code and experimented with it, but i
  couldn't find the problem. This is something for the signal
  specialists/system programmers from BSD and SYSV.
    (being worked on by Andreas Lange, help wanted!)
  -> note: with IPC it's o.k.

d.param.scale
 - lower axis description not readable
 - sometimes "floating point exeption", especially in par=geary
    (being worked on by ?)

d.rast.num: some numbers are displayed in wrong (unreadable) color
  (being worked on by ?)

[RC]d.rgb: Is there a difference between d.rgb and i.composite?
  (being worked on by ?)  

[RC]d.sites.qual: not all the sites are used/displayed
  d.sites.qual doesn't work properly: not all the sites 
  are used/displayed if the number of fields of the input site file is 
  not constant. Compare with d.sites.
 Comment from Eric G Miller:
    However, I do not believe this is a bug.  d.sites.qual needs consistent
    dimension, category and attribute data to work.  Besides, I think the  
    site_list is broken if it doesn't have a constant number and type of   
    fields (We're looking at allowing null fields for 5.1...).

 (reported by Moritz Lennert  mlennert@club.worldonline.be)
 Eric Miller:
 Yes, I brought this up before.  Seems the code hasn't been changed (I           
 didn't want to change others code).  The problem is the the interface with
 username/password pairs.  The code should be sending user=NULL,
 password=NULL, hostname=NULL, but instead sends hostname="localhost", which
 causes a TCP/IP connection vs. a UNIX socket, which will probably make your
 configuration demand a valid username/password pair.  It's definitely a bug,
 IMHO.

i.in.gtc/i.in.pri
  i.in.gtc, putting in input leadername voldirname and dataname        
  as required but....I get core dumped.

i.ortho.photo
 - if second control point is set by mouse, it is not indicated
   immediately in orange color (right window)
 - GIS WARNING: Can't write embedded null values for map open for random
   access: i.ortho.photo/photo.rectify/write.c needs to be updated.
  (being worked on by ?)  

i.tape.tm.fast: (Todd Shoemaker, jtshoe@datasync.com)

  (being worked on by ?)  

[RC]nviz2.2:
 - I have a surface with VERY small floating point values (ie 7.7e-011 etc). 
   I've imported using r.in.ascii and all is OK in normal GRASS display.      
   However, starting nviz you see the surface the right way up, then it flips 
   as if all values become negative. Incr the zexagg just stretches the values
   towards the bottom of the screen. Any suggestions?
   (reported by Phil <P.Atkinson@cdsc.nthames.nhs.uk>)
   Note: This bug can be easily reproduced by:
     r.mapcalc sine="sin(row()) * sin(col())"
     nviz2.2 el=sine
   (being worked on by ?)

 - I am unable to view data from a Latitude-Longitude database. No matter
   how much I adjust the lights I am unable to render a viewable surface.   
   The wire-frame mode appears fine. I assume the problem is related to the
   resolution calculation which it interprets as metres?? Should NVIZ work 
   for a Lat.-Long. database? Does it prefer integer, floating point, or           
   double elevation values?
   (reported by Bob Covill" <bcovill@tekmap.ns.ca>)
   -> hint: If you go into a lat/long location, load a surface
            and display it, you get a dark surface as described.
            If you go to the panel "lights" then and set
            "Height" to 0.0, the colors are o.k. !
  (being worked on by ?)  

 - If loading a region too large for the memory available, the nviz
   should stop (before freezing the machine).

p.map.new:
 - p.map.new now works but only with the grass4.2 raster files
   With the GRASS5.0 floating point raster files it gives the following
   error.
   WARNING: [desi] in mapset [PERMANENT] - format field in header file
   invalid
   WARNING: unable to open raster map [desi] in mapset [PERMANENT]
   desi in PERMANENT : can't open raster file
   I think it is to do with the new format of GRASS5.0 raster files.
 -> 5/2000: still a problem??

[RC]r.binfer
 - bug in table.c causing segfault
 - example scripts say, that value of predefined probabilities does not
   sum up to 1 although they do
  (reported by DIETER LEHMANN <lehmann@fh-nuertingen.de>)
  (being worked on by David D Gray)  

[RC]r.buffer
  r.buffer doesn't treat zero as nulls anymore (contrary to documentation)
  (reported by Malcolm Williamson <malcolm@cast.uark.edu>)
  -> fixed. New flag "-z": o.k. for all?

[RC]r.contour: (reported by D D Gray <ddgray@armadce.demon.co.uk>)
  Though it is not a stability problem, I've found that if this module is
  run on an elev raster with an active old-style mask, i.e applied with
  r.mask, the contour lines which terminate on the mask boundary (but only
  these) are duplicated, as if reflected off the mask boundary. The
  resulting line is then closed giving a closed loop that is folded in on
  itself with a node at one end or in the middle of the line, and no node
  at the other. This is most clearly seen when viewed with v.digit. I have
  not seen a prior report of this problem though I have looked. My
  apologies if this has already been documented. Though I can't look into
  this myself at the moment, I have prepared a quick fix in the form of an
  awk post-processor which ´cleans' this problem, splitting the loop and
  removing the duplicate segment (it also removes ´degenerate' lines ie.  
  lines of one point which r.contour creates occasionally.) I have added  
  this as an extension, though I stress it is just a temporary fix.
  (script: v.asc.degen)
  (being worked on by David D Gray)

[rc]r.cost
 somehow I have the feeling that r.cost is not working for me:
 Here is the command;
 r.cost -k input=g10g coord=30:44:45E,28:40:45N
   stop_coord=30:59:45E,31:23:15N output=g10g.cost max_cost=999999
 The basic idea is to look for flow patterns in the Nile basin as a test,
 but similar results obtain for the Danube, Mississippi, and Po.  In each
 case (see the attached images for dem and cost maps) the cost map seems
 to arbitrarily truncate at some cost value.
 This leaves a map which is mostly null unassigned pixels.  The max cost
 values in each case are not particularly large (always less than ~20,000),
 but the program acts as if, in calculating the costs to nearest pixels
 it reaches some innate maximum or limit, and shuts down.
 Perhaps some carried sum exceeds the MAXINT value, or some such.  I have
 no more good ideas.

r.flow
  bugreport: Issuing the command (-M switch is the problem):
  r.flow -M elevin=fill aspin=dir flout=flowout_M dsout=density_M
  [...] Writing density file...ERROR: r.flow: cannot write segment file for
        density_M
  r.flow seems to work OK with no switch and with the -m switch.

r.in.bin:

   -> put a note in html/html/r.in.bin.html

r.in.hdf/r.out.hdf (src.garden/grass.hdf)
 - needs updating to HDF5.x lib (already there)
  (being worked on by ?)

[RC]r.in.png:
 - remove dependency on "netpbm" libs: pnm.h
 -  seg. faults on Pentium CPU (compare r.binfer)
 -  r.in.png refused to import a 24-bit image.  However it seems to work 
    OK with an 8-bit image.

  (being worked on by David D Gray)

[RC]r.in.ppm
  seg. fault on Pentium CPU (compare r.binfer)
  Memory bug fixed by Alex Shevlakov
  (being worked on by David D Gray)

[RC]r.los:
  r.los seems to work perfectly if the elevation data is UTM.  But if the         
  elevation data is latitude-longitude, like most of my elevation data, the       
  output map looks like a hollow footprint: mostly "N" for cell values, except    
  for a few arcs of cells with values like 179 and 180, out where the horizon     
  might be expected.  If indeed these values mark the horizon, why do so few      
  (if any) cells between these arcs and the observer's cell have non-"N"          
  values?
  I tried a previous Grass version (5.0 beta 6) to see if r.los works with        
  latitude-longitude-projected elevation data, but the output maps look just      
  as bad.  Sometimes the output map looks like a TV-test-pattern: a really        
  bizarre pattern of radial lines emanating from the observer towards the         
  west.  Cells in this region have values in the millions or billions (I          
  forget how many digits).  The lines don't converge all the way to the           
  observer because the radial pattern is cut off along a vertical                 
  (north-south) line.  To the east of this vertical line, the cells have          
  smaller values - typically a few hundred - and form vertical stripes when       
  when the color map is rescaled to the lower values.                             
  Presumably the TV-test-pattern anomalies plagued only old versions of r.los,    
  but the hollow footprint anomaly persists in the current version.  What am I    
  doing wrong?

[RC]r.mapcalc
 - Values -129 in GRASS raster files are treated as Null
   (already fixed for FreeBSD/Linux. Check for other platforms, 
   further corrections go here:   src/libes/gis/null_val.c)
  (being worked on by ?)
 -  r.mapcalc does not like it if the cellvalues are very high for eg.,            
    initially I put the col=fips which ranges from 1001 to 55141 - it 
    core dumped ... I guess the limit in r.mapcalc is 32xxx which 
    is a "huge" limitation

r.null:
 does not work with reclassified maps.
 Comment from Eric G. Miller:
   The problem is, if r.null was run on the reclass raster it would alter    
   the original and any other reclass rasters of the original.  So, there are
   two basic approaches, let the user make a raster out of the reclass that  
   isn't a reclass (e.g. cho 'newmap = reclass' | r.mapcalc) or have        
   r.null do this for them.  With the second, a new raster has to be made     
   and what do you name it?  If you name it the same as the reclass and      
   blow away the reclass, is that okay? 
 (being worked on by ?)


[RC]r.poly
bugreport 1: I've noticed that r.poly doesn't extract polygons for 0
category areas. This was correct in GRASS 4, but not in GRASS 5. 
I don't know if it works correctly with null values.

bugreport 2: I've noticed that v.support complains about labels when
r.poly exports polygons with islands. In fact, I've seen that in
dig_att's file there is one label for each island (that's correct),
but the container +polygon is associated with n+1 labels, where n is
the number of contained islands. Everithing seems to work fine anyway,
but I may be related with another bug on v.trim that I'm going to
point out in a separate bug report

[RC]r.reclass:

r.resamp.rst:
  When processing quite a big DEM file with r.resamp.rst I got the  
  following message for output file:

r.rescale:
  r.rescale input=asp1 from=0,180 output=test_north to=1,1                      
  r.rescale does not set cells outside the "from" range to 0 (described in the    
  help), but to NULL
  (reported by timcera@earthlink.net)
  Andreas Lange, 10/2000: This is IMHO not a bug, but a feature. All modules
  should write NULL instead of 0 (zero) for missing values for patching 
  maps or display overlays. 
  But if the problem with r.reclass is solved i can add a "-z" flag that
  switches this behaviour from writing NULL to writing "0" (zero).

r.stats: some inconsistent results comparing to r.average
 *First, I compute the per-class averages:
     r.average base=medv cover=test out=borra.me
 *Second, I check the result for, i.e., class 23:
     d.what.rast map=medv,borra.me

           medv in user1  (23)S_SUPRAMEDITERRANEAN_ZONE
           borra.me in user1, quant   (111)
           borra.me in user1, actual  (110.794075)
 *Third, I compute the statistics for each class, but the results are not
  the same as given by d.what.rast. For example, for class 23:
     r.stats -c in=medv,borra.me
     r.stats:  100%
       ...
       23 110.299171-110.744906 6082
       ...
 *While d.what.rast was giving 110.794075. Is this a bug?

 - the dependency to OpenGL and Mesa should be checked automatically

   it will not work with standard Mesa RPMS, because the sgi-widgets

v.cutter: 
  For reducing the volume a rather large vectormap (16.000 polygons) I wrote a    
  grass5-script which                                                            
    1. automatically generates a rectangle around the current region (works at
       least with tmerc,lat/long,lambert-projection)                                        
    2. cuts the original map with v.cutter                                          
    3. runs v.spag -i and v.support                                                 
  This works fine, but only sometimes. I cut country outlines, DEM-contours       
  (created with r.contour) and a map with soil properties and I noticed that
  the size of the region seems to influence v.cutter. If, for example, i cut
  parts of the coastline of norway, v.cutter works for a region with a maximum width
  of 6 geographic degrees, a wider region produces an empty vector file. The          
  DEM-contour-map, which seems to contain much more data, can be cut using a     
  region of any size.                                                            
  Thus it appears that certain combinations of datafile and cutterfile cause      
  v.cutter to generate no vectors at all. I don't see any rule as to when it     
  works an when it doesn't so I think that this might be some bug in
  v.cutter.

[RC]v.out.shape:
  segmentation fault on Pentium II CPUs /Linux

v.support/v.build                                                               
  During the build process an area (polygon edge) that is just a single     
  link between two nodes is often not recognised so the polygon is          
  registered 'open' and so does not build. At least one intervening point      
  on the line will always fix this. It seems to me this shouldn't happen   
  and so is a bug. But where is it? It affects manually digitised maps      
  much more than autodigitised (like those done with v.mkgrid), so         
  perhaps it is in v.digit, or maybe in v.build.                           
  (being worked on by ?)

[RC]v.trim 
 bugreport: If a polygon has island, v.trim removes such islands
 from the vector file... urgh! I've obtained such a behaviour with a

 r.poly), I don't know if there is a relation (my map was a
 reclassified DEM).

Modules with interface problems (parser etc): 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
(collected by Andreas Lange, not release critical, bu should be fixed
 sometimes for consistency)

d.colors, d.pan, d.save, d.what.sites, d.zoom,                         
Thoses commands give only the text help when a monitor is running         
Without a running monitor, they print the following error message :      
No graphics monitor has been selected for output.                        
Please run "d.mon" to select a graphics monitor.    
-> change order of parsing and R_driver()?

d.site.pg, d.vect.pg, d.what.r.pg, d.what.s.pg, d.what.v.pg,        
g.column.pg, g.stats.pg, g.table.pg, v.reclass.pg print :                
 Please run g.select.pg to identify a current database.      

g.gisenv:
  g.gisenv help says nothing (not a bug, just to remind that it is
  always listed in grass.sum as FAILED).
  -help prints nothing

g3.region:
  no parser

i.tape.tm.fast:
  ERROR (only for xy-locations), no "Usage: " Info

m.region.ll -help prints :                                                      
m.region.ll - must be in a UTM database

m.in.stf1.tape:
 must be run in command mode only (USAGE:) ... no parser interface

r.mapcalc -help prints :
you have confused me

v.in.arc.pg -help prints :
 Coverage type:
Enter "polygon(area)" or "line"
Hit RETURN to cancel.

v.in.dlg: 
  ????

v.in.tig.basic -help prints :
ERROR: You are not in a UTM or Lat-Long location. Don't use this program.

v.in.tig.lndmk -help prints :
ERROR: Must be in UTM or Lat-Long location to use this program.

NOTE: When the location is in UTM, m.region.ll,v.in.tig.basic and
      v.in.tig.lndmk print a correct help message

v.mkquads -help prints the escape sequence <ESC>[H<ESC>[2J
before the help for erasing screen and put the help on top

m.lulc.USGS -help prints :
Cannot open USGS CTG file

tcltkgrass launch itself, ignoring the -help option...

All interactive functions print only:
Usage : <name of the command>
  (This command must be run interactively)

On the other hand, some help messages are huge (75 lines...)

Sometimes, a blank line is printed before the "Usage:" string 
this is also not consistent...

Further discussion/hints:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Comments on updating 4.x vector modules to 5.x vector:
   There is a slightly modified category support:

  Comment on vector cats from Bill Hughes:
  The Categories structure was changed between 4.x and 5.0beta.
  The change seems to have moved the *labels element out of the list
  structure and replace list.num with the index to **labels.  The fix
  is to change the SCS/* code to use 'cats->labels[i]' instead of
  'cats->list[i].labels'  There will be breakage around 'list[i].num'
  as well, and probably these can be deleted, or use 'cats->num' instead.
  The cats.count is cats.ncats now (see src/include/gis.h).

  Already sucessfully updated: v.random,v.extract,v.merge,v.autocorr
  updated src.contrib tree as well (10/99, Bill H.)


--------------------------------------------------------------------
Libraries bugs:

src/libes/geom: optri  -> used by s.geom, v.geom
   I [Bill Hughes] have been working through some errors in 
   src/libes/geom/optri and I have a tarball of the directory attached below.  
   This is not done yet, but it needs some expertise from somebody who 
   understands it.  Two references to grAllocate() have only 3 parameters.  
   I don't understand what it does, so I can't really guess at what
   should be passed as the final parameter.  I have put in 0 for the
   moment to get the compile to work.
   (being worked on by Andreas Lange)

Vector:
 R_polygon_abs() seems to ignore islands. Correct?
