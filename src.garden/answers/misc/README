This directory contains an exercise that was used as part of a class
assignment for the Spring, 1992 AGEN 526 Class in Agricultural Engineering,
Purdue University. The exercise was ostensively part of the
class instruction about watershed modeling, but also served
as test of the programs created for the ANSWERS-GRASS integration.
Map names used herein are references to layers existing in
the sample mapbase from the Indian Pine Natural Resource Laboratory.

I include this document to add to the GRASS documentation manuals for
the programs included in this distribution. Hopefully, you will be able
to use in a more step by step manner as you explore using r.answers
and its associate programs with the sample database.

FILES:

exercise.ps     - the exercise in postscript format.
exercise.troff  - the "raw" text with troff commands that was used
                  to create exercise.ps.
