/* at this point, the output of answers is in the file
   "answers_output". the following while loop it designed to sift
   through this and separate the output into the destination
   files described here:

   1. out_text - the verbose printout reiterating the input 
                 params and watershed charateristics, etc
   2. out_hydro  the outlet hydrographs. at this point, I am
                 assuming the user will use some means to plot
                 or analyze this data, so I will leave the
                 headers intact.
   3. out_sediment the sediment loss/deposition for individual
                 cell elements. we strip off headers and send
                 the summary lines to out_text. the numbers will
                 be converted to new map layers.
   4. out_chnl   channel deposition data. will be made into map
                 layer.

   As a side note, I should mention it was very tempting to simply
   modify the ANSWERS fortran code and make this part superfluous.
