   Program name: r.slope

   Input is an elevation surface map (elevation in meters).

   This is a modification of the r.slope.aspect program.

   The purpose is to compute slope percent in the format ANSWERS
   requires (slope * 10; i.e. a slope of 1.1% will be a cat value
   of 11). Therefore, even if you are not using the r.answers
   programs, you may still find use for the slope layers created if
   you want a bit more gradient data. (check out Raghaven's paper
   on comparing methods of calculating slopes, by the way).
