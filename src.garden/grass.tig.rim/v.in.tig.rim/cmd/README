The source code contained here creates only a front-end grass parser
to get input from the user and then call a shell script (placed in
etc) called v.in.tg.rm.sh.  The shell script makes calls to rim and to
v.db.rim, both of which contain fortran code and therefore require
that a site have a fortran compiler.  Do NOT compile this command
without first having done the following:

1.  obtain a fortran compiler
2.  compile rim (in src.related)
3.  compile v.db.rim (in src.garden/grass.rim)
