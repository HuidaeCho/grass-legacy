This directory contains the source code of the latest release of
HDF library, the makefiles for various platforms and an INSTALL
file.

If you use the top level makefile to compile and install the 
library, you don't need to use the makefiles in this directory.

The file Mac-Makefile.hqx contains the makefile for the Macs,
the file  makepc.msc is for IBM-PC, and the file Makefile is for
UNIX machines. You need to modify the lines marked "# ==>" in
Makefile for the platform you are using. 

VAX/VMS users should use MAKENOF.COM to compile the C interface 
and MAKEFS.COM to compile the Fortran interface. 

The file INSTALL explains how to compile different parts of the
library using the Makefile.
