Code changes after HDF3.2r2 was released on Nov.3, 1992:

1. DFSDpre32() of dfsd.c is replaced by DFSDpre32sdg() 
of dfsd.c; and dsp32sd() in dfsdf.c is replaced by 
dsp32sd() in dfsdff.f and dsip32s() in dfsdf.c.

For more details see the MigrationNotes. 

2. A bug is fixed in the  dump function of the utility hdfed.
It dumps all the number types on CRAY correctly. 

3. Two formats, -ushort for unsigned int16 and -udecimal for 
unsigned int32, are added to hdfed dump. The command:

	dump -help 

in hdfed lists all the formats available.
See ./util/README.TST  for test information.

Code changes after HDF3.2r1 was released on Sept.1,1992 

1. A bug was fixed in dsipdat() of dfsdf.c. It did not 
handle multidimentional data correctly.

2. A mistake in util/Makefile was corrected. 

.c.o: he.h he_proto.h
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) -I(HDFINC) -I(HDFLIB)/libdf.a $(GLLIB) $< 

3. In subdirectory test/, tr8.c, t24.c and tp.c were replaced by 
a new program trig.c.

4. In hdfi.h, the following code fragment was added for HP9000 and 
MIPSEL: 

#ifdef _STDC_
#define const
#endif /* _STDC_ */

5. Added support for NeXT machines.

6. A BinHexed version of the Makefile for Macintoch Mac-Makefile.hqx is 
added.

7. Mac-Makefile.test.hqx is added for the Mac to make the tests and some 
of the utilities. The utilities and tests should be built in the same 
folder when on the Mac.

8. A bug is fixed in vio.c solving the problem happened when the HDF3.2 
library read old Vdatas containing integer data. The following code 
fragment in the function map_from_old_types() in vio.c 


case LOCAL_SHORTTYPE:
return DFNT_INT16;
case LOCAL_INTTYPE:
case LOCAL_LONGTYPE:
return DFNT_INT32;


was changed to:


case LOCAL_SHORTTYPE:
case LOCAL_INTTYPE:
return DFNT_INT16;
case LOCAL_LONGTYPE:
return DFNT_INT32;

9. Added machine type CONVEXNATIVE to support CONVEX native format. 
The code is a contribution from Jan-Willem De Bruijn, University of 
Delft, Netherland.

10. Cosmetic fixes to hfile.c to compile clean on the Mac. 

11. Assorted fixes to hdfed to get it to work on the Mac. 

12. Added the function DF24lastref().

13. DFACC_ALL is changed back to have the same meaning that it had in 
pre-HDF 3.2 versions. Here is a list of all "DFACC" codes and their 
meanings. It is important to note that these constants are NOT bit-flags 
and should NOT be or'd together to combine access modes. Doing so may 
cause odd behavior and, in some cases, loss of data.

Recommended:
DFACC_READ:    Open for read only. If file does not exist, error.
DFACC_RDWR:    Open for read/write. If file does not exist, create it.
DFACC_CREATE:  Force creation. If file exists, delete it, then 
               open a new file for read/write. (in the spirit of 
               UNIX "clobber")

Others:
DFACC_ALL:     Same as DFACC_RDWR.
DFACC_WRITE:   Same as DFACC_RDWR.

14. Tests added in dfriginfo() and DFR8Iriginfo() to prevent endless 
loop when there is no more RIG in the file. 

15. The definition of DFdi is moved to hdf.h from df.h, dfsd.h, dfgr.h 
and dfrig.h.

16. Added the function DFSDpre32(). 

17. Typos fixed in constant.f.

18. Minor tweaks and twiddles for reduced warnings on various platforms.
