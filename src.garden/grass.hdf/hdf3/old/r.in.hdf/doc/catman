NAME
     _r._i_n._h_d_f - Convert data in HDF format into a (binary) raster
     map layer.

SYNOPSIS
     r.in.hdf
     r.in.hdf help
     r.in.hdf [-q] [-a] [-l] input=_n_a_m_e [output=_n_a_m_e]
     [mult=_v_a_l_u_e] [dsets=_v_a_l_u_e[,_v_a_l_u_e,...]]

DESCRIPTION
     _r._i_n._h_d_f allows a user to create a GRASS raster map layer
     from a file in NCSA Hierarchical Data Format (HDF).

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flags

     -_q   Run quietly

     -_a   Convert ALL data sets in the HDF file

     -_l   Only list the contents of the HDF file (no conversion)

     Parameters

     _i_n_p_u_t
          HDF file to be converted.

     _o_u_t_p_u_t
          Name of new raster file. (default: hdf.rast)

     _m_u_l_t Floating point multiplier. (rastfile = (int)(file.hdf *
          multiplier))

     _d_s_e_t_s
          A list of reference numbers for datasets to be
          extracted.

     The raster file created will have its southwest origin at 0
     East and 0 North, with resolution of 1.  To view the new
     GRASS raster file, use _g._r_e_g_i_o_n _r_a_s_t=_n_e_w_f_i_l_e, then use
     _d._r_a_s_t as normal.  You may wish to manually change the new
     raster's cellhd file.

     NCSA HDF is a multi-object file format developed by The
     National Center for Supercomputing Applications at
     Champaign, Illinois for the transfer of graphical and
     floating-point data between machines.  NASA Pathfinder AVHRR
     data is stored in HDF format.  The HDF format defines both a
     raster type and a SDS (scientific data set) type.  The later
     is basically a highly structured multi-dimensional array of

     values.  A single HDF file may contain more than one SDS or
     raster; using the -_a option will extract all data sets from
     the HDF file, creating a seperate GRASS raster file from
     each data set and naming the raster files _o_u_t_p_u_t_n_a_m_e_0_1,
     _o_u_t_p_u_t_n_a_m_e_0_2, _o_u_t_p_u_t_n_a_m_e_0_3.... If the -_a option is not
     specified and the HDF file contains more than one data set,
     only the first data set is extracted unless the user
     specifies specific reference numbers for desired data sets
     in the file using the _d_s_e_t_s option.  To see a list of
     reference numbers for data sets in an HDF file, use the -_l
     flag.  If the HDF file contains labels or descriptions of
     the data, these will be shown when using the -_l flag.
     Labels and descriptions from the HDF file will also be
     written to the GRASS history file when creating the raster
     map.  If a multiplier is given using the _m_u_l_t option, every
     file created will be the product of the input data set and
     the multiplier.  If the HDF file contains an SDS, it must be
     only two dimensional in order for _r._i_n._h_d_f to accept it as
     input.  If the HDF file contains an 8-bit raster image with
     an associated palette, a GRASS color file will be created.
     This program will not import 24-bit HDF raster images.

     NCSA distributes the HDF library and several public domain
     visualization applications which use the HDF format.  Some
     commercial applications also support HDF.  For more

BUGS
     If a data set contains long labels and descriptions, some of
     it may be truncated when writing to the GRASS history file.
     The GRASS history structure currently allows 50 lines of 80
     characters each.  But when editing history using r.support,
     only 20 lines of 65 characters may be used.
