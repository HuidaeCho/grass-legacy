NAME
     _r._i_n._h_d_f - Convert data in HDF format into a (binary) raster
     map layer.
     (_G_R_A_S_S _R_a_s_t_e_r _D_a_t_a _I_m_p_o_r_t _P_r_o_g_r_a_m)

SYNOPSIS
     r.in.hdf
     r.in.hdf help
     r.in.hdf [-q] input=_n_a_m_e output=_n_a_m_e [mult=_v_a_l_u_e]

DESCRIPTION
     _r._i_n._h_d_f allows a user to create a GRASS  raster  map  layer
     from  a  file containing a scientific data set (SDS) in NCSA
     Hierarchical Data Format (HDF).

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flags

     -_q   Run quietly

     Parameters

     _i_n_p_u_t
          HDF file to be converted.

     _o_u_t_p_u_t
          Name of new raster file.

     _m_u_l_t Floating point multiplier. (rastfile = (int)(file.hdf *
          multiplier))

     The raster file created will have its southwest origin at  0
     East  and  0  North,  with resolution of 1.  To view the new
     GRASS raster  file,  use  _g._r_e_g_i_o_n  _r_a_s_t=_n_e_w_f_i_l_e,  then  use
     _d._r_a_s_t  as  normal.  You may wish to manually change the new
     raster's cellhd file.

     NCSA HDF is a multi-object  file  format  developed  by  The
     National  Center  for  Supercomputing  Applications at Cham-
     paign, Illinois for the transfer of graphical and  floating-
     point data between machines.  The format defines both a ras-
     ter type and a SDS type.  The later is  basically  a  highly
     structured multi-dimensional array of floating point values.
     A single HDF file may contain more than one SDS,  but  using
     this  program  will  only extract the first SDS from the HDF
     file.  The SDS in the HDF file must also be only two  dimen-
     sional in order for _r._i_n._h_d_f to accept it as input.  The HDF
     raster format consists of a palette and a 2D array of  8-bit
     numbers, but _r._i_n._h_d_f does not yet recognize this format, so
     color tables are not transferrable.

     NCSA distributes the HDF library and several  public  domain
     visualization  applications  which use the HDF format.  Some
     commercial applications also support HDF.  For more informa-
