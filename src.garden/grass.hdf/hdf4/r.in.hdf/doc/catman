NAME
     _r._i_n._h_d_f - Convert data in HDF format into a (binary) raster
     map layer.

SYNOPSIS
     r.in.hdf

     r.in.hdf [-q] [-a] input=_n_a_m_e output=_n_a_m_e [mult=_v_a_l_u_e]

DESCRIPTION
     _r._i_n._h_d_f allows a user to create a GRASS  raster  map  layer
     from a file in NCSA Hierarchical Data Format (HDF).

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Flags

     -_q   Run quietly

     -_a   Convert ALL data sets in the HDF file

     Parameters

     _i_n_p_u_t
          HDF file to be converted.

     _o_u_t_p_u_t
          Name of new raster file.

     _m_u_l_t Floating point multiplier. (rastfile = (int)(file.hdf *
          multiplier))

     The raster file created will have its southwest origin at  0
     East  and  0  North,  with resolution of 1.  To view the new
     GRASS raster  file,  use  _g._r_e_g_i_o_n  _r_a_s_t=_n_e_w_f_i_l_e,  then  use
     _d._r_a_s_t  as  normal.  You may wish to manually change the new
     raster's cellhd file.

     NCSA HDF is a multi-object  file  format  developed  by  The
     National  Center  for  Supercomputing  Applications at Cham-
     paign, Illinois for the transfer of graphical and  floating-
     point data between machines.  The format defines both a ras-
     ter type and a SDS (scientific data set) type. The later  is
     basically  a  highly  structured  multi-dimensional array of
     floating point values.  A single HDF file may  contain  more
     than one SDS or raster; using the -_a option will extract all
     data sets from the HDF file, creating a seperate GRASS  ras-
     ter file from each data set and naming the raster files _o_u_t_-
     _p_u_t_n_a_m_e_0_1, _o_u_t_p_u_t_n_a_m_e_0_2, _o_u_t_p_u_t_n_a_m_e_0_3.... If the  -_a  option
     is  not  specified  and  the HDF file contains more than one
     data set, only the first data set is extracted.  If the  HDF
     file  contains  an  SDS,  it must be only two dimensional in

     order for _r._i_n._h_d_f to accept it as input.  If the  HDF  file
     contains  a raster image with an associated palette, a GRASS
     color file will be created.

     NCSA distributes the HDF library and several  public  domain
     visualization  applications  which use the HDF format.  Some
     commercial applications also support HDF.  For more informa-
