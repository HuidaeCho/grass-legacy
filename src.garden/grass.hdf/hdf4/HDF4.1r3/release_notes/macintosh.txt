Fortner Software LLC ("Fortner") created the reference implementation for
Macintosh of the HDF 4.1r3 library, providing C-language bindings to all
4.1r3 features.

The Macintosh reference implementation of the HDF 4.1r3 library was implemented
and tested on a PowerMac Model 7600/120 running MacOS 8.5.1 using Metrowerks
CodeWarrior Pro1.  The library has also been run on a PowerMac G3.  

Fortner cannot be certain that the libraries will run on other versions of
Macintoshes (or clones) or MacOS versions, or when built using other
development tools.  (In particular, this Macintosh implementation has not
addressed use with non-PowerPC versions of Macintosh [i.e., 680x0-based
Macintoshes]).  Migrating the Macintosh reference implementation to other
development and/or run-time environments is the responsibility of the
library user.

First-time HDF users are encouraged to read the FAQ in this release for
more information about HDF.  Users can also look at the home page for HDF
