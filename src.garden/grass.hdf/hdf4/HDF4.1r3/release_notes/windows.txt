Fortner Software LLC ("Fortner") created the reference implementation for
Windows of the HDF 4.1r3 library, providing C-language bindings to all
4.1r3 features.

The Windows reference implementation of the 4.1r3 library was implemented
and tested on a Pentium PC running Windows95 4.00.950 using Microsoft
Developers Studio 97 Visual C++ Version 5.00.   The library has also been
run on Pentium PC running WindowsNT version 4.0.

Fortner cannot be certain that the libraries will run on other versions of
Windows or when built using other development tools.  (In particular, this
Windows implementation has not addressed use with Windows 3.x, or non-PC
versions of WindowsNT).  Migrating the Windows reference implementation to
other development and/or run-time environments is the responsibility of the
library user.

First-time HDF users are encouraged to read the FAQ in this release for
