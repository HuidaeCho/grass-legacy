---------------
1. Add on the libpq update of the last of the 12 (or 13?) modules 
from the old grass.postres pack.
2. Check to see if there's a better graphics implementation for filling polys
in GRASS libraries. R_polygon_abs() seems to ignore islands. Yes, we can use it,
anyway, first finding islands, and replotting them.
3. Find the easy way to pick column names in Tcl/Tk interface. As of now,
they have just to be typed in. This may be as easy as rotating lists, though.
4. Find way to input spaces in Tcl/Tk "where" clauses.
5. Update manuals.
