		GRASS/PostgreSQL interface modules

1. g.select.pg - select a database to use in GRASS.

2. g.table.pg - list tables in currently selected DB.

3. g.columns.pg - list columns information in a table of selected DB.

4. g.stats.pg - calculate means, min, max, frequencies of specified 
numeric column.

5. d.site.pg - display and optionally copy/reclass sites selected 
by DB query. 

6. d.vect.pg - display and optionally extract lines/areas selected 
by DB query.

7. d.rast.pg - display(optionally) and reclass raster maps through 
DB query.

8. d.what.s.pg - query with mouse sites on graphics monitor. 
Option to dump the fields in comma-separated lists for other 
programs.

9. d.what.v.pg - query with mouse lines/areas. May be used by  
UPDATE command in PostgreSQL input through SQL command file. Consider 
piping anything you grabbed on screen through various filters.

10. d.what.r.pg - the same as above on raster maps.

11. v.reclass.pg - reclass vector maps, rules based on any 
SELECT filter.

12. v.in.shape.pg - DEPRECATED. Use v.in.shape + pg.in.dbf instead.

13. v.in.arc.pg - DEPRECATED. Use v.in.arc + pg.in.dbf instead.

14. pg.in.dbf - program that inputs DBF file and dumps all 
columns to PostgreSQL.

15. v.to.pg - this program is used to export GRASS vectors (lines or polys)
to PostgreSQL native "line" or "polygon" formats.

Please see these modules manuals for explanations and examples.

NB: Tcl-Tk modules may have input "where" clause restricted to one rule
typed without "whitespace" while in terminal input the number of sub-clause 
is not limited by this.
