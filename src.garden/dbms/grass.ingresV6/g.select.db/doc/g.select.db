     g.select.db help
     g.select.db database=name

DESCRIPTION
     g.select.db is used to identify an SQL database for
     subsequent GRASS-RDBMS applications. The program checks the
     directories identified in the envionment variable $DBPATH
     for a database directory named [name.dbs]. If the database
     specified on the command line is located in the users
     current DBPATH g.select.db sets the GRASS environment
     variable DATABASE to this name. If the database is not found
     a list of the database directories in $DBPATH is provided to
     the user. If the environment variable $DBPATH is not set the
     program notifies the user and terminates. This program and
     all other dbSQL tools assume that SQL CONNECT and SELECT
     have been granted to the user.
