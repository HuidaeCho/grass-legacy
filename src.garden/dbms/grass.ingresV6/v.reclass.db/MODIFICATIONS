v.reclass.db - Modifications for INGRES

****************************************

INGRES version: 6

INGRES version specific subroutines:
	ingresUnTable

Modified and/or renamed subroutines:
	main
	sqlQry <=> infxQry

New subroutines:
	ingresUnTable
	ingresGetKey

Modified and/or renamed include files:
	None

New include files:
	ingresUtils.h

INGRES modifications:
	'\g' added at end of SQL query (sqlQry)
	Syntax of execution of SQL command (sqlQry)
	Reading SQL output (sqlQry):
		ingresUnTable added (INGRES v6 specific).
		ingresGetKey added.
		Strcmp between the output and the column name (key) is 
		limited to the length of the SQL output. The SQL output
		may be truncated.

Improvements:
	Explanatory messages added
	SQL queries on the form (select * from ...) are handled. The first
	column is extracted from the output. It is assumed that this column
	is the key column (ingresGetKey).

Bug Fixes:
	In loop to reclassify vectors (sqlQry):
		Loop control by 'firstFlag' instead of 'curcat'.
		1st argument in G_set_cat is 'catcnt' instead of 'line_cat'.
		Label is 'dbname category catcnt' instead of 
		'dbname category line_cat'.
