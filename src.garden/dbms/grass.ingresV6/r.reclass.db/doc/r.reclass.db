NAME
     r.reclass.db - Generate a new raster reclass map based on
     the results of multiple queries to the currently selected
     database.
     (GRASS-RDBMS Raster Interface Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.reclass.db
     r.reclass.db help
     r.reclass.db sql=file input=name key=name output=name
     [label=name]

DESCRIPTION
     r.reclass.db generates reclass rules for a new raster map
     layer based on the results of multiple queries to the
     currently selected database. The user constructs a series of
     mutually exclusive SQL select statments designed to return
     groups of records from the database. Each group of records
     should be interanally consistent in terms of attribute
     characteristics specified by the user in the SELECT clause.
     These groups should also be mutually exclusive, thereby
     insuring that a row returned by one SELECT clause is not
     also returned by a subsequent SELECT clause. Each group of
     records therefoe forms the basis for a single category in
     the resulting GRASS raster reclass map. r.reclass.db
     processes each SELECT statement in order generating the
     GRASS reclass rules needed to create a new raster map. As
     each SELECT statment is processed the group of records
     returned receives a common category value. The category
     value is incremented by one for each subsequent SELECT
     statment which is processed. The resulting reclass map will
     have one category for each of the original SELECT statements
     and an additional category for no data areas. No data in
     this case includes actual no data areas and areas for which
     no rows were returned by the database queries.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     sql=filename
          Name of file containing SQL query statements.

     input=map
          Name of an existing raster map layer.

     key=database_column_name
          Name of the database column linked to GRASS via the
          categories in the input map layer.

     output=map
          Name of new raster (reclass),  file.

EXAMPLE:
     r.reclass.db sql=dbrr.sql key=grass_cat input=seco.soils
     output=tfact.recl label="Tfact="

     dbrr.sql:

          SELECT grass_cat from seco_soil_cats,layer
          WHERE layer.tfact >0 AND layer.tfact <=2 AND
          layer.muid=seco_soil_cats.muid ;


          SELECT grass_cat from seco_soil_cats,layer
          WHERE layer.tfact >2 AND layer.tfact <=4 AND
          layer.muid=seco_soil_cats.muid ;


          SELECT grass_cat from seco_soil_cats,layer
          WHERE layer.tfact = 5 AND
          layer.muid=seco_soil_cats.muid
