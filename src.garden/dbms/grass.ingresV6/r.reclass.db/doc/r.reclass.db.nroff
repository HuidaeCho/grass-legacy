.SH DESCRIPTION
r.reclass.db generates reclass rules for a new raster map layer based on the results of multiple queries 
to the currently selected database. The user constructs a series of mutually exclusive SQL select
statments designed to return groups of records from the database. Each group of records should be interanally
consistent in terms of attribute characteristics specified by the user in the SELECT clause. These
groups should also be mutually exclusive, thereby insuring that a row returned by one SELECT clause is not also 
returned by a subsequent SELECT clause. Each group of records therefore forms the basis for a single category in 
the resulting GRASS raster reclass map. r.reclass.db processes each SELECT statement in order generating the
GRASS reclass rules needed to create a new raster map. As each SELECT statment is processed the group of
records returned receives a common category value. The category value is incremented by one for each
subsequent SELECT statment which is processed. The resulting reclass map will have one category for each
of the original SELECT statements and an additional category for no data areas. No data in this case
includes actual no data areas and areas for which no rows were returned by the database queries.
