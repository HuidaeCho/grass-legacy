NAME
     g.table.db - Generate a list of database tables in the
     currently selected database.
     (GRASS-RDBMS General Interface Program)

SYNOPSIS
     g.table.db
     g.table.db help

DESCRIPTION
     g.table.db is used to generate a list of the tables in the
     currently selected SQL database. The currently selected
     database is identified by the GRASS environment variable
     $DATABASE which is set using the g.select.db GRASS-RDBMS
     interface tool. If this environment variable is not set the
     program terminates with a message to the user. Otherwise,
     the names of the tables in the currently selected database
     are displayed on the screen in three columns. The names of
     the tables in the current database are needed to construct
     query criteria for use in many of the other dbSQL tools.
     This command can be run at any time and is provided for
     reference purposes, to be used while performing GRASS-RDBMS
     applications.
