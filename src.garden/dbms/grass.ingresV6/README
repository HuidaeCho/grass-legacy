This is the GRASS-INGRES interface for INGRES version 6.

It is a modified version of the GRASS-INFORMIX interface, developed
by Jim Farley at University of Arkansas.

Note that this version of the GRASS-INGRES interface contains bugs!
 
Most of the routines have first been modified for INGRES version 5. They
have been tested on INGRES version 5. I have not had any possibility to test
them all on INGRES version6. I have, however, done most of the modifications
to make them work with INGRES version 6. Below follows a listing of the
modules and the problems that may occur when running them with INGRES ver 6.

In each directory you will find a file called MODIFICATIONS,
that describes the modifications from the GRASS-INFORMIX interface,
as well as the differences between INGRES version 5 and version6. There
is also a file called STRUCTURE in each directory. It describes the program
structure.

The modification in SQL syntax for INGRES are described in the file 
SQLsyntax in this directory.

Problems that may occur when running the GRASS-INGRES interface with
INGRES version 6:

D.WHAT.R.DB
D.WHAT.V.DB
D.WHAT.S.DB

These modules are the same for INGRES ver5 and 6,  Tested and OK.


G.TABLE.DB
G.SELECT.DB

These modules have been developed and tested for INGRES ver6. There should
not be any problems running them. They do not, however, give any explanatory 
messages during execution. This has been added to all other routines (except
g.column.db, see below).


G.COLUMN.DB

G.column.db was developed and tested for INGRES ver6, but may give problems 
in verbose listing. I'm not sure whether this was implemented correctly for
INGRES ver. 6 or not! This module does not give any explanatory messages
during execution.


G.STATS.DB

G.stats.db will not work for INGRES ver.6. Checking for datatype is 
system dependent and has not been implemented correctly for version 6. 


D.RAST.DB
D.VECT.DB
D.SITE.DB

The only thing that hasn't been tested with INGRES ver6 for these modules is
the WHERE clause 'IS NOT NULL' (buildSQL). Problems may occur when running
the module on joined tables. The subroutine 'ingresUnTable' is system
specific, but it has been tested on INGRES ver6 and should work OK.


R.RECLASS.DB
V.RECLASS.DB

These modules are the same for INGRES version 5 and 6. There should not
be any problems running them. The subroutine 'ingresUnTable' is specific
for INGRES version 6, but it has been tested and should work OK.      


R.RESCALE.DB
                    
The only thing that hasn't been tested with INGRES ver 6 for this module is
the WHERE clause 'IS NOT NULL' (sqlQry). Problems may occur when running
the module on joined tables. Note that there are a number of bugfixes in
this routine compared to the original GRASS-INFORMIX interface. The sub-
routine 'ingresUnTable' is specific for INGRES version 6, but it has been
tested and should work OK.
