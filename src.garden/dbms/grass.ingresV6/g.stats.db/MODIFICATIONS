PROBLEMS? Yes, the INGRES system specific calls in 'chktype' and 'sqlStats'
	  have not been modified for version 6.

INGRES version: 6

INGRES version specific subroutines:
	chktype
	sqlStats

Modified and/or renamed subroutines:
	main
	sqlStats <=> infxStats
	chktype
	buildSQL <=> buildInfx

New subroutines:
	ingresUnTable

Modified and/or renamed include files:
	ingres.h <=> infx.h (NEVER USED)
	ingstats.h <=> stats.h (NEVER USED)

New include files:
	ingresUtils.h

INGRES modifications:
	Program structure is modified: 
		'sqlStats' is called from 'main' and not from 'chktype'.
		'buildSQL' is only called from 'main' and not from 'sqlStats'.
	Two arguments to 'chktype'. sqlFile is not passed.
	'ingresUnTable added to read SQL output (chktype, sqlStats).
	Syntax for execution of SQL command modified (chktype, sqlStats).
	'\g' added to SQL query (sqlStats).

Improvements:
	Explanatory messages added.

Bug Fixes:
	The program has been restructured and a number of modifications
	have been implemented, mainly for handlig of files (open, close, 
	pass to subroutines etc).
