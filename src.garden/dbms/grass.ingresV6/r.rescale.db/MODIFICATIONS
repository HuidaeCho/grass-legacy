****************************************

INGRES version: 6

INGRES version specific subroutines:
	ingresUnTable
	sqlQry

Modified and/or renamed subroutines:
	main
	sqlQry <=> infxQry

New subroutines:
	ingresUnTable
	fancyDisplay (Currently not used)

Modified and/or renamed include files:
	dbrescale.h	

New include files:
	ingresUtils.h
	displayUtils.h (Currently not used) 

INGRES modifications:
	SQL query syntax (sqlQry)        
	'\g' added at end of SQL query (sqlQry)
	Syntax of execution of SQL command (sqlQry)
	Reading SQL output (sqlQry):
		ingresUnTable added (INGRES v6 specific)
	SQL syntax for MIN_MAX modified (sqlQry)

Improvements:
	Explanatory messages added.

	The definition of intervals has been improved to avoid that the last
	interval differs a lot in size from the others. This would be the
	case when the integer division gives a large remainder. With the
	improved algorithm, the difference can at most be half the size of 
	the interval.

Bug Fixes (sqlQry):
	Ensure correct table is input to MIN_MAX.

	1st argument when writing reclass rules is 'keyval' and not 'colval'.

	Condition to write reclass rules is '(colval ,= curmax)' and not
	'(keyval <= curmax)'.

	Variable 'oldmax' initialized to 'mincol' and not '1'.
	
	Variable 'curmax' is set to 'oldmax + interval' and not 
	'oldmas + interval + 1' when the category is incremented for 
	writing to reclass rules file. 

	The maximum category values for the las interval is set to 'maxcol'
	and not to 'curmax + interval'.

	If the MIN column value is '0' it is still included in the first
	interval. ie 'mincol' is not changed to 1. '0' is a value in the
	reclass column and should not be treated as 'no data'. 

Remaining Bugs - r.reclass can only operate on integer columns. This should
		 be improved so that float is accepted.
