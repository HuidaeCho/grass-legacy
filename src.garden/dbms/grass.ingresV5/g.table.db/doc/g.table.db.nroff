.SH DESCRIPTION
g.table.db is used to generate a list of the tables in the currently selected SQL database. The currently selected database is identified by the GRASS environment
variable $DATABASE which is set using the g.select.db GRASS-RDBMS interface
tool. If this environment variable is not set the program terminates with a
message to the user. Otherwise, the names of the tables in the currently
selected database are displayed on the screen in three
columns. The names of the tables in the current database are needed to
construct query criteria for use in many of the other dbSQL tools. This command
can be run at any time and is provided for reference purposes, to be used while
performing GRASS-RDBMS applications.
