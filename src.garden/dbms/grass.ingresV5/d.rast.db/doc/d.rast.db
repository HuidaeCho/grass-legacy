NAME
     d.rast.db - Generate and display a reclass map based on the
     unique values in a database column.
     (GRRASS-RDBMS Interface Display Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.rast.db
     d.rast.db help
     d.rast.db key=name tab=name col=name input=name
     [output=name] [join=tab,tabkey,pkey]

ALTERNATE
     d.rast.db -s help
     d.rast.db -s sql=filename input=name [output=name]

DESCRIPTION
     d.rast.db displays a raster image in which each category
     represents a uniques value in a database column. Values are
     retrieved from the current database based on a user defined
     SQL select statement. The current database is identified by
     the GRASS environment variable $DATABASE which is set using
     the g.select.db GRASS-RDBMS interface tool. If no join
     parameters are specified by the user a column in the
     database table directly linked to the GRASS raster structure
     via the category value must be used. The output from this
     program is a set of GRASS reclass rules which are used to
     create and display a reclassed raster surface based on the
     attributes returned from the database and the raster data
     layer specified as the input map.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters

     key=database_column_name
          Column corresponding to category values in raster map
          [input]

     tab=database_table_name
          Table containing [col].

     col=database_column_name
          Column to base reclass on.

     input=map
          Name of existing raster file.

     output=map
          Name of new reclass map.

     join=tab,tabkey,pkey
          Tab is the table used to develop the current SQL query.
          Tabkey is the database column used to relate

          information in this table with data in the table linked
          to the GRASS category file. Pkey is the associated
          column in the table linked to the GRASS category file
          which is related to tabkey in the current table.

          For instance, assume that seco_soil_cats is a table
          containing column values associated with category
          values in a the GRASS raster file soils. In addition,
          assume that compyld is a table containing attribute
          data on the crop production capacity in the same area
          (cropname). In this example seco_soil_cats is the table
          associated with the GRASS raster map and grass_cats is
          the column linking seco_soil_cats to the GRASS category
          file, the table compyld contains the attribute
          information to base the query/reclass on and it is
          linked to seco_soil_cats via the common column muid. To
          specify a query based on attribute values in the table
          compyld:

               d.rast.db key=grass_cat tab=seco_soil_cats
               col=cropname input=soils
               join=compyld,compyld.muid,seco_soil_cats.muid

          Specifying these conditions would insure that all rows
          from table compyld which satisfy the query criteria
          would be matched with the corresponding rows in table
          seco_soil_cats, which are then related to the spatial
          features in the GRASS data layer via the GRASS category
          values.

          This syntax is adequate to accomplish 2 table joins.
          However, if the query demands joins between more than 2
          tables it is advisable to use the -s option [see
          Alternate Command Line Usage] to read a user prepared
          query, complete with join requirements, from a file.

ALTERNATE COMMAND LINE USAGE
     The alternate command line usage is provided to simplify the
     process of retrieving information from more than one table
     in the query criteria. The alternate command line structure
     is selected using the the [-s] flag on the command line.
     When using this flag the user must include the name of a
     text file on the command line as well. This file must
     include a complete, well formed SQL SELECT statement
     specifying the query criteria and all relevant JOINS needed
     to retrieve values which correspond to category values in a
     GRASS data layer.

     The user must also specify the name of the GRASS data layer
     containing these category values on the command line. The
     following example illustrates the syntax which must be used
     in constructing a SELECT statement for use with the -s flag.

          SELECT UNIQUE tlid FROM cfcc_atts, cfcc
          WHERE cfcc.majfea="roads"
                AND cfcc.minfea="county roads"
                AND cfcc.cfcode=main.cfcode
                AND main.cfcode IS NOT NULL
          ORDER BY main.cfcode




     Flags

     -s   SQL select statements are input from a prepared file.

     Parameters

     sql=filename
          SQL statements specifying well formed selection
          criteria.

     input=map
          Name of an existing raster map.

     output=map
          Name of a new reclass file.


EXAMPLE (two table join )
     d.what.r.db  -s sql=statsgo.sql map=seco_soils
     statsgo.sql:
          SELECT UNIQUE grass_cat,cropname
               FROM seco_soil_cats,compyld
               WHERE compyld.muid = seco_soil_cats.muid
               AND cropname IS NOT NULL
          ORDER BY cropname



RESULT:
     This example will display a raster surface with a category
     for each unique value of the column "cropname" from the
     table compyld. The raster surface will be a reclassed data
     layer based on the input raster map seco_soils.

BUGS
     None known.
