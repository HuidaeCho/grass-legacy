NAME
     d.what.r.db - Report database attributes associated with a
     raster category value at a specified location.
     (GRASS-RDBMS Attribute Interface Program)

SYNOPSIS
     d.what.r.db
     d.what.r.db help
     d.what.r.db map=name tab=name col=name
     [join=tab,tabkey,pkey]

ALTERNATE
     d.what.r.db -s help
     d.what.r.db -s sql=filename map=name

DESCRIPTION
     d.what.r.db reports database attributes from the currently
     selected database associated with a raster category at a
     specific location on a raster map. The currently selected
     database is identified by the GRASS environment variable
     $DATABASE which is set using the g.select.db GRASS-RDBMS
     interface tool. If this environment variable is not set the
     program terminates with a message to the user.  The current
     raster location is selected by the user with the mouse. If
     no join parameters are provided by the user on the command
     line the attributes in the table directly linked to the
     GRASS raster structure via the category value are returned.
     However, if a join is specified then attributes from a
     related table are displayed. If the alternate form of this
     command is selected with the -s flag the user has greater
     control over the number of relational joins and the manner
     in which the attribute information is displayed. Using the
     -s option the attributes from more than one table can be
     returned and displayed.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters:

     map=map
          Name of an existing raster map with category values
          linked to the currently selected database.

     tab=database_table_name
          Table in the currently selected database containing a
          column associated with raster category values.

     col=database_column_name
          Column associated with raster category values.

     join=tab,tabkey,pkey
          Tab is the table used to develop the current SQL query.
          Tabkey is the database column used to relate

          information in this table with data in the table linked
          to the GRASS category file. Pkey is the associated
          column in the table linked to the GRASS category file
          which is related to tabkey in the current table.

          For instance, assume that seco_soil_cats is a table
          containing column values associated with category
          values in a the GRASS raster file soils (cropname). In
          addition, assume that compyld is a table containing
          attribute data on the crop production capacity in the
          same area. In this example seco_soil_cats is the table
          associated with the GRASS raster map and grass_cats is
          the column linking seco_soil_cats to the GRASS category
          file, the table compyld contains the attribute
          information to base the query/reclass on and it is
          linked to seco_soil_cats via the common column muid. To
          specify a query based on attribute values in the table
          compyld:

                  d.rast.db key=grass_cat tab=seco_soil_cats
                  col=cropname input=soils
                  join=compyld,compyld.muid,seco_soil_cats.muid

          Specifying these conditions would insure that all rows
          from table compyld which satisfy the query criteria
          would be matched with the corresponding rows in table
          seco_soil_cats, which are then related to the spatial
          features in the GRASS data layer via the GRASS category
          values.

          This syntax is adequate to accomplish 2 table joins.
          However, if the query demands joins between more than 2
          tables it is advisable to use the -s option [see
          Alternate Command Line Usage] to read a user prepared
          query, complete with join requirements, from a file.


ALTERNATE COMMAND LINE USAGE
     The alternate command line usage is provided to simplify the
     process of retrieving information from more than one table
     in the query criteria. The alternate command line structure
     is selected using the the [-s] flag on the command line.
     When using this flag the user must include the name of a
     text file on the command line as well. This file must
     include a complete, well formed SQL SELECT statement
     specifying the query criteria and all relevant JOINS needed
     to retrieve values which correspond to category values in a
     GRASS data layer.

     The user must also specify the name of the GRASS data layer
     containing these category values on the command line. The
     following example illustrates the syntax which must be used

     in constructing a SELECT statement for use with the -s flag.


EXAMPLE (single table)
     d.what.r.db  -s sql=statsgo.sql map=seco_soils


     statsgo.sql:
          SELECT * FROM seco_soil_cats
          WHERE grass_cat.tlid=?

     Results: Reports all attributes from the table
     seco_soil_cats associated with the raster category value at
     the current mouse location the raster map seco_soils.



EXAMPLE (two table join )
     d.what.r.db  -s sql=statsgo.sql map=seco_soils


     statsgo.sql:
          SELECT * FROM seco_soil_cats, mapunit, compyld
          WHERE grass_cat=? AND
               seco_soil_cats.muid=mapunit.muid AND

               mapunit.muid=compyld.muid


     Results: Reports all attributes from the table
     seco_soil_cats, mapunit and compyld associated with the
     raster category value at the current mouse location in the
     raster map seco_soils.



     Flags:

     -s   SQL select statements are input from a prepared file.

     Parameters:

     sql=filename
          SQL statements specifying well formed selection
          criteria.

     map=map
          Name of an existing raster map with category values
          linked to a database.
