This is the GRASS-INGRES interface for INGRES version 5

It is modified from the GRASS-INFORMIX interface developed by 
Jim Farley at Univ. of Arkansas.

All modules have been tested for INGRES version 5.

Each directory contains a file called MODIFICATIONS. It describes the
modifications from INFORMIX to INGRES, as well as the INGRES version
dependent parts of the modules. 

There is also a file called STRUCTURE in each directory. It describes
the program structure of the module.

The file SQLsyntax in this directory describes the differences in 
SQL syntax between INFORMIX and INGRES.
