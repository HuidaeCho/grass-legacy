****************************************
g.select.db - Modifications for INGRES

Katarina Johnsson, 930421
****************************************

INGRES version: 5

INGRES version specific subroutines:
	d.select.db is based on a query to the INGRES system tables.
	The system tables are entirely different for INGRES ver 5 and
 	INGRES ver 6, and so is d.column.db.

Modified and/or renamed subroutines:
	main

New subroutines:
	None

Modified and/or renamed include files:
	None

New include files:
	None

INGRES modifications:
	Database names are extracted from a system database table in the
	system data base, with an SQL query. Both the table name and the
	database names are hard coded.
	
	A net-prefix is automatically added to the database name. It is
	required by INGRES NET, to run multiple users. 
Improvements:
	Explanatory messages added.

Bug Fixes:
	None
