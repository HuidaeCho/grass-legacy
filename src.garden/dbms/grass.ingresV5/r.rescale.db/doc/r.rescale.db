NAME
     r.rescale.db - Generate a raster map layer in which the
     categories represent values in a database column which have
     been divided into equal interval units.
     (GRASS-RDBMS Raster Interface Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.rescale.db
     r.rescale.db help
     r.rescale.db tab=name key=name col=name cats=name input=name
     output=name [join=tab,tabkey,pkey]

DESCRIPTION
     r.rescale.db creates a reclassed raster map layer by
     dividing the values in a numeric column in the currently
     selected database into equal interval units. The number of
     resulting categories is determined by the user via the
     command line parameter [cats=]. r.rescale.db evaluates the
     range of values for the database column and subsets these
     values into equal interval groups of records returned by the
     query. For example, if the database column contains values
     which range from 1-1000 and the [cats] value is equal to 10
     the resulting raster map layer will contain the 10
     categories:1=1-100, 2=101-200 etc. In other words, each
     category in the new raster map layer will represent a range
     of 100 values from the database column used in the rescale
     operation. The database column being evaluated must be
     numeric in type. To identify the data types of columns in a
     database table use the g.column.db command with the [-v]
     flag. r.rescale.db does not take outlying data values into
     account. Therefore, if the range of values for a database
     column contains a limited number of extreme values the
     resulting rescale operation will be skewed in the direction
     of these values.



COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Parameters

     tab=database_table_name
          Table containing a column linked to category values in
          an existing raster map.

     key=database_column_name
          Column corresponding to category values in an existing
          raster map.

     col=database_column_name
          Column to base rescale operation on which is numeric in
          type.

     cats=value
          Number of categories to define in the resulting reclass
          map.

     input=map
          Name of an existing raster file with category values
          linked to a column in the currently selected databae.

     output=map
          Name of new raster map.

     join=tab,tabkey,pkey

          Tab is the table used to develop the current SQL query.
          Tabkey is the database column used to relate
          information in this table with data in the table linked
          to the GRASS category file. Pkey is the associated
          column in the table linked to the GRASS category file
          which is related to tabkey in the current table.

          For instance, assume that seco_soil_cats is a table
          containing column values associated with category
          values in a the GRASS raster file soils. In addition,
          assume that rsprod is a table containing attribute data
          on the crop production capacity in the same area
          (prodfav). In this example seco_soil_cats is the table
          associated with the GRASS raster map and grass_cats is
          the column linking seco_soil_cats to the GRASS category
          file, the table compyld contains the attribute
          information to base the query/rescale on and it is
          linked to seco_soil_cats via the common column muid. To
          specify a rescale based on attribute values in the
          table rsprod:

               r.rescale.db tab=rsprod key=grass_cat col=prodfav
               cats=5 nput=seco.soils output=prodfav.rescale
               join=seco_soil_cats,seco_soil_cats.muid,rsprod.muid


          Specifying these conditions would insure that all rows
          from table rsprod which satisfy the query criteria
          would be matched with the corresponding rows in table
          seco_soil_cats, which are then related to the spatial
          features in the GRASS data layer via the GRASS category
          values.

          This syntax is adequate to accomplish 2 table joins.
          However, if the query demands joins between more than 2
          tables it is advisable to use the -s option [see
          Alternate Command Line Usage] to read a user prepared
          query, complete with join requirements, from a file.
