NAME
     v.reclass.db - Generate new vector map layer derived from
     attribute data in the currently selected database.
     (GRASS-RDBMS Vector Interface Program)

SYNOPSIS
     v.reclass.db
     v.reclass.db help
     v.reclass.db sql=name key=name input=name [output=name]
     [label=name]

DESCRIPTION
     v.reclass.db generates a new vector map layer based on the
     results of one or more queries to the currently selected
     database. The user constructs a series of mutually exclusive
     SQL select statments designed to return groups of records
     from the database. Each group of records should be
     interanally consistent in terms of attribute characteristics
     specified by the user in the SELECT clause. These groups
     should also be mutually exclusive, thereby insuring that a
     row returned by one SELECT clause is not also returned by a
     subsequent SELECT clause. Each group of records therefore
     forms the basis for a single category in the resulting GRASS
     vector map. v.reclass.db processes each SELECT statement in
     order returning groups of records which will for a single
     category in the resulting map.  As each SELECT statment is
     processed the group of records returned receives a common
     category value. The category value is incremented by one for
     each subsequent SELECT statment which is processed. The
     resulting reclass map will have one category for each of the
     original SELECT statements.

     For example, the rows associated with the first SELECT
     statement will be assigned to category 1, those associated
     with the second SELECT statement will be assigned to
     category 2 and so on. The output map will contain only those
     line segments associated with database rows returned by the
     SELECT statement(s).
