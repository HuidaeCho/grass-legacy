To build a test data base for s.db.rim:

1) Run GRASS using the Spearfish location.

2) cd to this directory.

3) Run these commands:
   s.db.rim arch
   .input arch.make1
   .input arch.add
   .ex

4) s.db.rim can now be used on this data base following the
   information in the manual pages.  dbsites can also be used.

5) Rim can also be used to access this data base; however, do not
make changes using Rim unless you are highly experienced with both
s.db.rim and Rim.



The file arch.make can be used in dbsites to build the same
data base.  The arch.add script must be used through s.db.rim to
load the data base.


See directory $GISBASE/src.related/rim/test for two sample Rim
data bases (sample and arch).  These are not intended for use with
s.db.rim or dbsites.
