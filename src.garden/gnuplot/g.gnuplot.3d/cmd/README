Added -persist option (usable with gnuplot 3.6) to
keep output window after exit of g.gnuplot.3d (close
the window through typing "q" (quit))

-------------------


This is a program, which creates 3-d images of vector maps. 
It's possible to plot also the elevation raster with or without vector maps.


YOU WILL NEED g.gnuplot TO RUN THIS PROGRAM.

Usage:
 g.gnuplot.3d [-ce] elev=name [lines=value] [vect=name[,name,...]]
   [term=name] [exaggeration=value]

Flags:
  -c   Elevation from the category label in the grid cell
  -e   Show elevation surface

Parameters:
          elev   Name of elevation raster map
         lines   Frequency of vector lines in output
                 default: 1
          vect   Name of vector map(s)
          term   Name of output terminal
  exaggeration   vertical exaggeration factor
                 default: 2.0


for example: 

g.gnuplot.3d -e elev=dem lines=5 vect=roads,streams exaggeration=10

You can make also hardcopies with this program:
g.gnuplot.3d -e elev=dem lines=5 vect=roads,streams term=postscript | lpr

3-d plot data is stored in $LOCATION/$MAPSET/gnuplot subdirectory.
If you want to modify the output, go to $LOCATION/$MAPSET/gnuplot and
edit gnu.3d script and then run g.gnuplot gnu.3d.
