Edit Constrain-Horizontal Mode

In Edit-Constrain-Horizontal mode you will only be able to drag the
brush either right or left. To make a horizontal edit you place the
brush cursor over the cell where you wish the edit to start, press
and hold down the left mouse button, move the brush cursor either
left or right, and then release the left mouse button to stop.
