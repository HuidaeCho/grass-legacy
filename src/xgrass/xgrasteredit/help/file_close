The File-Close Menu Option

This menu option will close the current editing session and 
will return the raster-editor to @ref("Edit-Unloaded mode.",xgre/mode_unloaded)  If you
are editing a raster map, the raster map will remain as a 
@ref("segment file",xgre/segfile.def) in your mapset so that your may resume editing
at a later time (using the @ref("File-Resume",xgre/file_resume) menu option).
