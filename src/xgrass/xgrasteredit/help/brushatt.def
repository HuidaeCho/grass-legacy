Brush cell attributes

During editing a brush cell is applied to one raster map
cell at a time.  Each brush cell has three attributes that
determine how it will effect the raster map cell to which it
is applied.  These are the input, the operation, and the
value.  You can use the Brush-Edit menu option to set
the attributes for each brush cell.

1) Brush-cell Input

This attribute specifies how the brush-cell input value will
be determined.  There are three possibilities:

   INPUT:CATEGORY
   The brush-cell input value will set equal to the
   brush-category value.  You may set the brush-category value
   by using the Brush-Category menu option.

   INPUT:VALUE
   The brush-cell input value will be set equal to the
   brush-cell's value parameter.

   INPUT:READ
   The brush-cell input value will be set equal to the value
   of the raster map cell to which the brush-cell is being
   applied.

2) Brush-cell Operation

This parameter specifies how the new raster map value will
be determined.  There are four possibilities:

   OPERATION:COPY
   The new value will be set equal to the brush input value.

   OPERATION:ERASE
   The new value will be zero (0).

   OPERATION:MULT
   The new value will be equal to the brush input value
   multiplied by the raster map value.

   OPERATION:ADD
   The new value will be equal to the brush input value added
   to the raster map value.

   OPERATION:NULL
   The raster map value will not be changed.

3) Brush-cell Value

The brush-cell value is an integer value that has the same
range as a raster map value (normally it is a four byte integer).
