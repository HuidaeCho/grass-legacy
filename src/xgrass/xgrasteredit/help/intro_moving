Moving around a raster map

Once a raster map is loaded into the editor you will find it
very easy to @glossary("zoom",16.glossary/zoom.def) into areas of interest, or if the raster map
is too large to fit in the editor's window, you will be able
to rapidly pan around the raster map using a pair of scrollbars.

As you move the mouse cursor over the raster map, you will
see the both the raster map row/column and @ref("easting",16.glossary/easting.def)/ @ref("northing",16.glossary/northing.def)
coordinates of the mouse cursor displayed in a readout panel
below the raster map display area.  You will also see the raster
map @glossary("category value",16.glossary/catval.def) and @glossary("label",16.glossary/catlab.def) of each cell that the cursor
passes over displayed in the readout panel.

The @ref("View-Zoom",xgre/view_zoom) menu option will start a zoom window with a
magnification control so that you can zoom into an area of
interest and then adjust the level of magnification.

If you are working with a very large raster map that will
not fit in the raster-editor's window, then you can use the
scrollbars to pan around the raster map.  The @ref("View-Index",xgre/view_index)
menu option will bring up a window that shows an overview
of the entire raster map, with a box drawn around the
portion of the map which is shown in the raster map
display area.
