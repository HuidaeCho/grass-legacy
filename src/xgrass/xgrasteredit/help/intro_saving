Saving and Safe-Guarding Your Raster-Editor Files

If you have spent even a little time editing a raster map, you
should probably use the @ref("File-Save",xgre/file_save) menu option to write it
out to a new raster map file name.

Do not use File-Save to write out changes to the original
raster map file name unless you are absolutely sure that all of
your changes are acceptable. 

When you are completely finished editing a raster map and you
have saved it using File-Save, you should close and remove it
using the @ref("File-Close-And-Remove",xgre/file_remove) menu option.
