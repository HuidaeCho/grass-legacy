Edit-Normal Mode

Editing is enabled in Edit-Normal mode.  If you position
the mouse cursor over a raster map cell and press the
left mouse button, then the brush will be applied to 
that cell.

You can disable editing by using the @ref("Edit-Lock",edit_unlock) menu 
option or by clicking on the locked padlock button on 
the buttonbar.
