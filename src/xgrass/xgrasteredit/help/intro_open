Opening a raster map

There are two ways to load a raster map into the editor.  The
@ref("File-Open",xgre/file_open) menu option allows you to select a raster map from
your @glossary("mapset search path",16.glossary/srchpth.def) to be loaded into the raster editor.
Once you select a map, the raster-editor will convert the map
to a @ref("segment file",xgre/segfile.def) for more efficient access.  This conversion
can take a couple minutes for a very large raster map.

The @ref("File-Resume",xgre/file_resume) menu option allows you to select a raster map
that has already been converted to a segment file.  Its called 
File-Resume because you are resuming a previous editing session 
and all changes that you may have made during that session will 
be intact in the raster map that you resume.

When you open a raster map you will notice that the mode, which
is displayed directly under the raster map display area, will
change to @ref("Edit-Locked mode.",xgre/mode_locked)
