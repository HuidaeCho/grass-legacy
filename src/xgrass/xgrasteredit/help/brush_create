The Brush-Create Menu Option

This dialog allows you to create a MxN new brush.  You 
will be presented with a simple dialog so that you can 
specify how many rows (N) and columns (M) of cells the new brush 
should have and then you will be presented with the 
@ref("Brush-Edit",xgre/brush_edit) dialog so that you can configure the new brush.
