The File-Close-And-Remove Menu Option

You should use this menu option when you are completely
finished editing a raster map and you have no intention of
resuming editing at any time in the near future.  

The raster map @ref("segment file",xgre/segfile) will be removed from your @glossary("mapset",16.glossary/mapset.def) 
and the raster editor will be returned to @ref("Edit-Unloaded mode",xgre/mode_unloaded) 

If you have made some edits since the last time that you saved 
then you will be given a last chance to save these changes to 
a raster map in your mapset.
