The View-Redraw Menu Option

This menu option will cause the portions of the raster map 
that you have edited (since the last View-Redraw or @ref("Edit-Undo",xgre/edit_undo)) 
to be redrawn using the raster map color-table colors instead 
of the @ref("brush-highlight color.",xgre/brushclr.def)

Redraw also clears the Edit-Undo buffer.
