The Brush-Category Menu Option

This menu option allows you to set the @ref("brush category value.",xgre/brushcat.def)
You will be presented with a list of all the categories in the
raster map (in a xgbrowser dialog-box) so that you may choose 
the category that you wish to be the brush category.

If you would like to modify or add a new category, you can use
the @ref("Edit-Category",xgre/edit_cats) menu option.
