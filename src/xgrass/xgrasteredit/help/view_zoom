The View-Zoom Menu Option

This menu option will start a new window so that you may
@glossary("zoom",16.glossary/zoom.def) into areas of interest in the currently loaded raster map.  
The zoom window consists of a zoom display area, a magnification
control, a Dismiss button, a Redraw button and a Help button. 

You must select the center of the area on which you would like
to zoom.  You do this by moving the mouse cursor into the main 
raster map display area (the cursor will turn into a magnifying
glass symbol when it enters this area), positioning the cursor 
over the area, and pressing the left mouse button.  If you
want to zoom into another area, just repeat this operation. 
When you are done, press the Dismiss button to close the
zoom window.

You can increase the magnification factor of the zoom window
by moving the magnification control slider to the right.  Moving
it to the left will decrease the magnification.  The magnification
range goes from 1.1x to 10.0x.

You may edit using the zoom window.  The same @ref("edit modes",xgre/intro_mode) that 
work in the raster map display area will work in the zoom display
area.  The zoom window Redraw button will call the @ref("View-Redraw",xgre/view_redraw) menu 
option.
