Edit-Constrain-Vertical Mode

In Edit-Constrain-Vertical mode you will only be able to drag the
brush either up or down.  To make a vertical edit you place the
brush cursor over the cell where you wish the edit to start, press
and hold down the left mouse button, move the brush cursor either
up or down, and then release the left mouse button to stop.
