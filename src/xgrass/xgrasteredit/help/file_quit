The File-Quit Menu Option

This choice allows you to exit from the raster-editor program.
If you were in the middle of an edit session, the the session will
be closed and will remain as a @ref("segment file",xgre/segfile.def) in your @glossary("mapset",16.glossary/mapset.def) so that
you may resume editing at a later time (by using the @ref("File-Resume",xgre/file_resume)
menu option).
