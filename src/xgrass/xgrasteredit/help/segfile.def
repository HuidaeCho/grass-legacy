Segment File

A segment file is a specially formatted raster map data file 
that may be accessed more efficiently than a regular GRASS 
@ref("raster map",16.glossary/rastmap.def) file.

A segment file, much like a raster map file, is actually made 
up of a number of components.  A segment file is stored in your 
@glossary("mapset",16.glossary/mapset.def) in the directory "seg".  Also, There is a segment header 
file which is stored in your mapset in the directory "seghd", 
a segment color file which is stored in your mapset in the 
directory "segcolr", and a segment categories file which is 
stored in your mapset in the directory "segcats."
