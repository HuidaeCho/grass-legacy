Brush category value

The raster map category value that is to be associated with
the brush.  This value must be the same as an existing category
value in the currently loaded raster map.  

Brush cells whose INPUT attribute are set to CATEGORY will use 
this value.  You may set the brush category value by use of 
the @ref("Brush-Category",xgre/brush_cat) menu option.
