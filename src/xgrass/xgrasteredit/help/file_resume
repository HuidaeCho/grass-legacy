The File-Resume Menu Option

This choice allows you to resume editing an existing raster map
@ref("segment file",xgre/segfile.def) that was created during a previous editing session.  
You will be presented with a list of the available segment files 
(in an xgbrowser dialog) so that you may select the one that you would 
like to resume.
