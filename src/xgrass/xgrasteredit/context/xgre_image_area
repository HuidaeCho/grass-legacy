This is the raster-editor's image display area.  When
a raster map is loaded using either the File-Open or 
File-Resume menu option, it will be loaded into this area.  

If the raster map is too big to fit in this area, then you
may either resize the raster-editor's window, and/or use the 
scroll-bars to move about the image.
