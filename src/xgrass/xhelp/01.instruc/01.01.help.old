             HOW TO USE HELP  - The XGRASS User Assistance Facility

Welcome to XGRASS's help system, the User Assistance Facility (UAF).
The UAF has been developed in a hypertext environment.  By selecting
highlighted keywords or phrases, the user can link to various types of
information relating to usage of GRASS4.0 and XGRASS, the graphic user
interface to GRASS 4.0.

The UAF provides the user with several different types of help: context
help, command-specific help, help referenced by topic areas, and an on-line
glossary and user's manual.  The following sections describe how to use
and access each type of help.

XGRASS Context Help

Each XGRASS window provides the user with "context" help.  That is, help
on the actual buttons, boxes, and interactive areas located in that window.
This type of help is accessed by pulling down the menu under the Help
button located at the bottom right hand corner of each XGRASS window.  The
first selection on the menu reads "On Context," and when selected will 
change the cursor to a question mark.  By placing the question mark over
any area, button or box in the window and clicking, an information, or "i"
box, will appear with a description of the item selected. This type of help
is useful when the function of a particular area, box or button is not
immediately apparent.

Command-specific Help

Command specific help is also accessed under each XGRASS window's Help
menu.  Listed are GRASS topics that relate specifically to the command
invoked.  For example, if "List Available GRASS Database Files" is selected
from the XGRASS Main Menu, a window will pop-up and the first box in the
window describes the GRASS command that will be executed in order to list
the GRASS files (in this case, 'g.list').  By pulling down the window's Help
menu, there will be a menu selection entitled "Database Management Tools."
The information contained in this topic area relates specifically to the
use of database management tools, of which 'g.list' is one.  This type of
information is useful when knowledge is needed on how this command can be
applied in performing specific tasks.

GRASS Topics

This help resource provides information on GRASS and its many capabilities
by topic area.  Each topic area categorizes GRASS commands by their specific
application within GRASS.  General information is provided on a topic (i.e.,
map development) and the GRASS commands relevant to that topic are given.
The option to access more detailed information on each GRASS command is also
provided.  GRASS Topics is accessed from the XGRASS Main Menu bar under the
Help Menu.

GRASS On-Line Glossary and User's Manual

The GRASS Glossary provides definitions of the most commonly used GIS and
GRASS terms.  The GRASS Manual provides access to either brief or detailed
definitions of GRASS Commands.  Both of these resources are accessed from
the Help Menu, located on the XGRASS Main Menu bar.
