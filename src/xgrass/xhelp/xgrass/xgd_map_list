This is a scrolled list, containing the names of the available mapsets
within the current location, which is indicated by the selection in
the location list just to the left.  If there is no location selected
in that list, then this list is empty.  Click on a mapset here to
choose it as your current mapset.  This list contains only the mapsets
which you are allowed to use and modify.
