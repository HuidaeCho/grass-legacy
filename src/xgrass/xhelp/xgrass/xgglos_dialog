The GRASS Glossary allows you to quickly access definitions of commonly-used
GRASS terms or phrases.  You may search the glossary in two ways:
	1) You can select the first letter of the term or phrase you wish to
	   see defined and then select that term or phrase from the "Matches"
	   box.
	2) You can perform a "keyword search" in which you type in the term
	   or phrase (or part of the term or phrase) you would like to see
	   defined, execute the search, and then select that term or phrase
	   from the "Matches" box.
