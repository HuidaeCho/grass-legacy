Select items to reclass from this list. The  selection  mechanism
used:

Pressing BSelect (Button 1) selects it and  deselects  any  other
selected  item. Dragging BSelect or pressing and dragging BExtend
(Shift + Button1) following a BSelect action  selects  all  items
between  the  item  under  the  pointer  and  the item  on  which
BSelect  was pressed.  This  action  also  deselects   any  other
selected items out  side that range.  Extended Select also allows
the user to select and deselect discontiguous  ranges  of  items.
Pressing  BToggle  (Control  +  Button  1) on an item toggles its
selection state but does not deselect any other  selected  items.
Dragging  BToggle  or  pressing  or dragging BExtend following  a
BToggle action sets  the selection  state of  all  items  between
the  item   under  the pointer  and the item on which BToggle was
pressed to the  state   of   the  item   on  which   BToggle  was
pressed.   This action does not deselect any other selected items
outside that range."
