To create a session, you may enter its name here and click the button
just to the right.  A session may only be created if the database,
location, and mapset fields below are all filled in.  You may also
select an existing session by typing its name here and pressing
return.  This action is equivalent to clicking on the session name in
the list of sessions, in the previous dialog.
