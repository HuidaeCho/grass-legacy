d.menu - 

d.menu allows the user to create a menu containing a title and
options, and to display this menu in the active @glossary("frame",16.glossary/graphframe.def) on the grpahics
monitor.  After the menu is displayed in the active frame, the pointing
device (@glossary("mouse",16.glossary/mouse.def)) is activated and must be used to select one of the menu
options.  The number associated with the selected menu option is then
printed to standard output and the program exits.  This program provides
GRASS macro writers with a mouse interface for users.
