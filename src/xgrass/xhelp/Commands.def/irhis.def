i.rgb.his - 

i.rgb.his is an image processing program that processes three input
@glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) @glossary("map layers",16.glossary/maplayer.def) as red, green and blue components and produces
three output raster map layers representing the hue, intensity and
saturation of the data.  The output map layers are created by a
standard red-green-blue (rgb) to hue-intensity-saturation (his) color
transformation.  Each output map layer is given a linear grey scale
color table.
