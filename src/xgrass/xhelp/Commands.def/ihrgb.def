i.his.rgb - 

i.his.rgb is an image processing program that processes three input 
@glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) @glossary("map layers",16.glossary/maplayer.def) as hue, intensity and saturation components and
produces three output raster map layers representing the red, green and
blue components of this data.  The output map layers are created by
standard hue-intensity-saturation (his) to red-green-blue (rgb) color
transformation.  Each output map layer is given a linear grey scale
color table.
