r.mapcalc - 

r.mapcalc performs arithmetic on @glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) @glossary("map layers",16.glossary/maplayer.def).  New map layers
can be created which are arithmetic expressions involving existing
raster map layers, integer or floating point constants and functions.

The paper 'r.mapcalc: An Algebra for GIS and Image Processing' provides
examples of how some spatial filters commonly used in image processing
can be built using r.mapcalc.
