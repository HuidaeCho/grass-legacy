r.report - 

r.report allows the user to set up a series of report parameters to be
applied to a @glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) map layer and creates a report.  If invoked with
command line arguments, the report will print out to the screen only.
However, output may be redirected to a file or another program using
the @glossary("UNIX",16.glossary/unix.def) redirection mechanism.  If invoked without command line
arguments, the user is given the option of printing out each report
and/or saving output to a file.
