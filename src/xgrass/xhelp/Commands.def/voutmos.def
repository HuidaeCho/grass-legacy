v.out.moss - 

v.out.moss produces a MOSS import file containing GRASS @glossary("site",16.glossary/site.def), line or
area features that have been converted into MOSS point, line or polygon
features, respectively.  Only one type of data (site, line or area) can
be converted at a time.  Site data can be extracted from GRASS site
list files or vector files, at the user's discretion.   The resultant
MOSS files will be created in the 'moss' subdirectory of the current
@glossary("mapset",16.glossary/mapset.def).
