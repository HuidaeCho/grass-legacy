r.infer - 

r.infer is an inference engine which applies a set of user-specified
rules to named @glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) map layers.  A new raster map layer named
"infer" is created as output, whose @glossary("category values",16.glossary/catval.def) reflect the
ability of each @glossary("cell",16.glossary/cell.def) in the named input layers to satify the named
conditions.
