i.tape.tm

i.tape.tm is the program that extracts Thematic Mapper @glossary("(TM)",16.glossary/tm.def) imagery
from tape.  When a TM image is captured, it is stored in four quads.
If all four quads are present, they will be juxtaposed on the image. 

Each quad is stored on tape as a separate image, and therefore, each
quad must be extracted separately.  Each quad will require a new run of
'i.tape.tm'.
