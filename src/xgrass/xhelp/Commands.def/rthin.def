r.thin - 

r.thin scans a @glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) file and thins non-zero cells that denote
linear features into linear features having a single cell width.
The program will thin only the non-zero cells of the input raster
file within the current @glossary("geographic region",16.glossary/georeg.def) settings.  The cell width
of the thinned output raster file will be equal to the cell
@glossary("resolution",16.glossary/res.def) of the currently set geographic region.
