split.sh - 

split.sh is a Bourne shell script that clears the entire graphics
screen and divides it into two display @glossary("frames",16.glossary/graphframe.def).  Map layers are then
displayed in each of the two frames.  This command is very useful for
visually comparing maps (@glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def), @glossary("vector",16.glossary/vector.def) and 3-d views) and can be
used by other GRASS shell macros.  It is also useful for creating
demos.
