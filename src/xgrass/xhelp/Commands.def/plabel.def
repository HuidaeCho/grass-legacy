p.labels - 

This program allows the user to create or modify @glossary("labels",16.glossary/label.def) files.  These
labels files, which are stored in the @glossary("database",16.glossary/database.def), define text information
for printing with @man("p.map") and for graphics display with
@man("d.paint.labels").  Each label has components which determine the text,
the location of the text on the image, its size and the background for
the text.
