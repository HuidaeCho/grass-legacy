r.combine - 

r.combine allows @glossary("category values",16.glossary/catval.def) from several @glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) map layers to
be combined.  The program accepts commands that are similar to those 
used for @glossary("Boolean",16.glossary/boolean.def) combinations (AND, OR, NOT) in order to overlay
user-selected groups of @glossary("categories",16.glossary/cat.def) from different raster map layers.
