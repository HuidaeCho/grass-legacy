i.class - 

i.class performs the first pass in the GRASS two-pass supervised 
image classification process.  The GRASS program @man("i.maxlik")
executes the second pass.  Bothe must be run to generate a classified
map in GRASS @glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) format.

i.class generates spectral signatures for an image by allowing the
user to outline regions of interest.  The resulting signature file
can be used as input for i.maxlik or as a seed signature file for
@man("i.cluster").
