shade.rel.sh - 

shade.rel.sh is a Bourne shell script that creates a @glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) shaded
relief map based on current @glossary("resolution",16.glossary/res.def) settings and on sun altitude
and azimuth values entered by the user.  The new shaded relief map is
named 'shade' and stored in the user's current @glossary("mapset",16.glossary/mapset.def).  The map is
assigned a grey-scale color table.
