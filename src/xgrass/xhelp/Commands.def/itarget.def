i.target - 

i.target is and imagery function that "targets" an imagery group to
a GRASS database standard LOCATION.  This is a LOCATION that has
standard coordinates such as @glossary("UTM",16.glossary/utm.def) and @glossary("State Plane",16.glossary/stplnsys.def).   An example 
application of the i.target program is as follows.

During the imagery program @man("i.rectify"), a specific LOCATION is
required in which to transfer the rectified file or files just prior
to completion of the program.  i.target enables the user to specify
this LOCATION for the imagery group that is about to undergo i.rectify.
Because @man("i.points") also uses information abou the target location,
i.target must be run berfore running i.points and i.rectify.
