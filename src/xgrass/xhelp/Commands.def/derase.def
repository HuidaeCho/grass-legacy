d.erase - 

d.erase erases the contents of the active @glossary("graphics display frame",16.glossary/graphframe.def) and
replaces it with the color black (by default) or by whatever color is
specified by the user.  Because d.erase replaces the contents of the
active display frame with a color, it will obscure those portions of
any frames that overlap the active frame with that color.
