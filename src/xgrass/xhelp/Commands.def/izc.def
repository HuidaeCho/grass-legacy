i.zc - 

i.zc is an image processing program used for edge detection.  The
@glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) map produced shows the location of 'boundaries' on the
input map.  Boundaries tend to be found in regions of changing 
@glossary("cell",16.glossary/cell.def) values and tend to run perpendicular to the direction of the
slope.
