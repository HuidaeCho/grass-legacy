v.in.arc - 

v.in.arc converts @glossary("vector",16.glossary/vector.def) data in ARC/INfO's "Generate" format to
GRASS's vector file format, and brings it into the user's current GRASS
@glossary("mapset",16.glossary/mapset.def).  The files to be imported to GRASS must first have been
exported from ARC/INFO using the ARC/INFO "Ungenerate" command, and may
represent either linear features ("line coverage") or areal features
("polygon coverage").
