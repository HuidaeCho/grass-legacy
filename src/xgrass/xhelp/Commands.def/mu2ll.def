m.u2ll - 

m.u2ll converts Universal Transverse Mercator (@glossary("UTM",16.glossary/utm.def)) @glossary("northings",16.glossary/northing.def) and
@glossary("eastings",16.glossary/easting.def) to geographic coordinates (i.e., latitudes and longitudes).
The user must specify the UTM coordinates to be converted and the
spheroid on which the geographic coordinates will be based.  The program
also needs to know the @glossary("UTM zone",16.glossary/utmzone.def) in which the input coordinates are
located.  However, if the user is running GRASS from a UTM database
@glossary("LOCATION",16.glossary/loc.def), m.u2ll will use this database's UTM zone designation if
no zone is specified by the user.
