d.mapgraph - 

d.mapgraph draws graphics that are described in standard input (default)
or the @glossary("UNIX",16.glossary/unix.def) filename.  This program essentially performs the same
functions as @man("d.graph"); however, point locations are specified to
d.mapgraph in the geographic coordinate system of the user's current
@glossary("mapset",16.glossary/mapset.def) and @glossary("location",16.glossary/loc.def) rather than in graphics display screen
coordinates.
