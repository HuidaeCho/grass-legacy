v.import - 

v.import is an @glossary("interactive",16.glossary/interactve.def) program which runs other @glossary("vector",16.glossary/vector.def) import
programs.  It allows the user to import @glossary("DLG",16.glossary/dlg.def) or ASCII vector files and
ASCII vector files into binary vector files.  It also creates two
support files, the 'dig_plus' file and the 'dig_att' file (only created
when importing DLG files).  The 'dig_plus' file contains topological
information obtained by analyzing the vector file.  The 'dig-att' file
contains @glossary("category",16.glossary/cat.def) (attribute) information files by the labeling
function of the GRASS @man("v.digit") program.  All of the above files must
be run through v.import before they can be used in the v.digit program.
