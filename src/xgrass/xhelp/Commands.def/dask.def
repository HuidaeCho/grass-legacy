d.ask - 

d.ask is designed for shell scripts that need to prompt the user for
the name of a database file in the user's current GRASS @glossary("mapset",16.glossary/mapset.def) search
path.  After d.ask is invoked with needed parmeters, the mouse becomes
active and a menu containing files of the specified element type is
displayed on the user's graphics monitor.
