v.to.sites - 

The v.to.sites program extracts @glossary("site",16.glossary/site.def) data from a GRASS @glossary("vector",16.glossary/vector.def)
@glossary("map layer",16.glossary/maplayer.def) and stores output in a new GRASS sites list file.  The
resulting sites map can be used with such programs as @man("d.sites").  Only
site (point) features in the user-specified vector map layer are
extracted and placed into the resulting site list.  Lines and areas in
the vector file are ignored.
