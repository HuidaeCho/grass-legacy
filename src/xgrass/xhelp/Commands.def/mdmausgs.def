m.dmaUSGSread - 

m.dmaUSGSread extracts digital terrain elevation data (@glossary("DTED",16.glossary/dted.def)) from
1/2-inch magnetic tape that was produced by the Defense Mapping Agency
(@glossary("DMA",16.glossary/dma.def)) but bought from the USGS.  These two agencies distribute the
same data in a slightly different format.
