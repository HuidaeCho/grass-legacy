m.rot90 - 

m.rot90 is used as a companion program to the @glossary("DTED",16.glossary/dted.def) and @glossary("DEM",16.glossary/dem.def) digital
elevation tape extraction programs @man("m.dted.extract") and @man("m.dmaUSGSread").
m.rot09 rotates the contents of the output files generated by these tape
extraction programs 90 degrees.  Rotation is necessary to compensate
for the orientation of the data read from tape.  This program can be
used in conjuction with the program m.import.ll to convert this
rotated data into GRASS raster map layer form.
