d.rgb - 

d.rgb visually overlays up to three files, each displayed in either
red, green or blue (rgb).  As each overlay is displayed in a single
@glossary("band",16.glossary/band.def), the intensity at each point is the average intensity of the
red, green and blue components of the currently active color table.
