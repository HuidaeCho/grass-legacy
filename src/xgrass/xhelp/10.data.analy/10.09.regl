                     REGIONAL ANALYSIS AND FILTERS

GRASS can also be used to analyze and filter data "regions". 
Neighborhood filters modify each @glossary("cell",16.glossary/cell.def) value as a function of the cell
values found in its (square) neighborhood.  Regional filters make each
cell value a function of the values found within its (user-defined)
region/clump of cells.  A region can be defined as a contiguous group
of cells having the same category value.  Such filters are useful for
imagery analysis and other applications.

Listed below are GRASS programs which can be used for regional analysis
and filtering.  

         @ref("-  i.zc ",Commands.def/izc.def)                   @ref("-  r.clump ",Commands.def/rclump.def) 
         @ref("-  r.average ",Commands.def/ravg.def)              @ref("-  r.volume ",Commands.def/rvol.def)
