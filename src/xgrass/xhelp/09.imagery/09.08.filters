                       BUILDING CUSTOM FILTERS

The user may wish to model interactions across a landscape or remove
systematic distortion occurring across a map or image.  Both
applications can be accomplished by filtering data.  Custom filters can
be built which make the value of one pixel a user-defined function of
the values in the surrounding @glossary("cells",16.glossary/cell.def).  

The GRASS programs that can be used to build custom filters are:

	@ref("-  i.zc ",Commands.def/izc.def)
	@ref("-  r.mapcalc ",Commands.def/rmapcalc.def)
	@ref("-  r.mfilter ",Commands.def/irmfilt.def)
	@ref("-  r.neighbors ",Commands.def/irneigh.def)
