                  EXTRACTING OTHER DIGITAL DATA 

Increasingly, geographically-referenced spatial data are being made
available in digital format.  In order to use these data within GRASS,
the user must be able to extract data from their magnetic storage media,
import them to GRASS data format, and spatially reference them with
other existing digital data.  The section, "Sources of Digital Data"
lists some available digital data sources for GRASS data sets.

Other sections (see "Extracting Digital Elevation Data" and
"Extracting Digital Imagery Data") discuss the extraction of elevation
and imagery data from magnetic tape.  Specific procedures for extracting
these data from tape and importing them into a GRASS data base are
described in the papers @ref("DTED and DEM Elevation Data Extraction",18.biblio/adp.n-87.22)
and the @ref("GRASS Imagery Tutorial",18.biblio/adp.n-87.22).

GRASS commands also exist to perform generic tape data extraction and
manipulation.  Those commands are listed below.

        @ref("-  i.tape.other ",Commands.def/itother.def)            @ref("-  m.examine.tape ",Commands.def/mextape.def)
                                      @ref("-  m.rot90 ",Commands.def/mrot90.def)
