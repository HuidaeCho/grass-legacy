                          TAPE FORMATS 

Multi-band data can be ordered in either band sequential (BSQ) or
band-interleaved (BIL) formats, at either 1600 bpi or 6250 bpi.  In
BIL format, the different image bands are stored together (interwoven)
for each pixel in the image.  In BSQ format, band data are separated --
data for all image pixels in one image band are stored together,
followed by all data pertaining to a second band, etc.  GRASS can handle
either BIL or BSQ data.  See the @ref(""GRASS Imagery Tutorial"",18.biblio/adp.n-87.22) or the
programs listed under the Image Processing menu for further information.
