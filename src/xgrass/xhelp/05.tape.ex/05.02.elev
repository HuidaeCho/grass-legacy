                  EXTRACTING DIGITAL ELEVATION DATA

Elevation data are used in a variety of GRASS applications.  Alone,
they can be used to generate maps of slope, @glossary("aspect",16.glossary/aspect.def), and 3-D
graphics. They can also be used in combination with other data types
as, for example, with vegetation or soils to delineate species' habitats
or correlate changes in vegetation or soil types with elevation.  Other
applications include hydrologic modeling, soil erosion evaluation and
prediction, and line of sight analyses.  Before such data can be used,
however, they must be converted to a @glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) format usable within GRASS.
@ref("DTED and DEM Elevation Data Extraction",18.biblio/adp.n-87.22) describes specific procedures
by which users can convert digital elevation data produced by the
Defense Mapping Agency (@glossary("DMA",16.glossary/dma.def)) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
into GRASS raster format.  It also details processes for generating
slope and aspect raster map layers from the imported elevation data,
and for rescaling these elevation data.

See also @ref("Options for Acquiring Elevation Data",18.biblio/tm.n-89.20) for a more
detailed look at how elevation data are produced and the forms in which
they are available.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Defense Mapping Agency (DMA)
distribute digital elevation data at several resolutions and in
different tape formats.  These data are referred to as digital elevation
models (DEMs) and digital terrain elevation data (DTED).  The GRASS
programs listed below extract this data from 1/2" magnetic tape, list
tape contents and rotate the data.
