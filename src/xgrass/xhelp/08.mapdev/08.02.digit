                           DIGITIZING MAPS

The commands listed below allow the user to enter paper (and other
hardcopy geographic information) into GRASS databases, and to manipulate
such data in GRASS. Their prefixes ("v.", "r.", and "s.") respectively
denote whether commands operate on data in GRASS vector, raster or
site_lists file format.  

Although all of the commands listed below are used to develop new map
data, "v.digit" is mainly used to develop new map data from non-digital
sources.  "v.digit" is a robust, highly interactive data development
program used for vector @glossary("digitizing",16.glossary/digitize.def), editing, labeling and converting
@glossary("vector",16.glossary/vector.def) data to @glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) format.  The user can digitize data using
either a @glossary("digitizer",16.glossary/digitizer.def) hooked-up to his system, or GRASS's on-screen
digitizing capability.
