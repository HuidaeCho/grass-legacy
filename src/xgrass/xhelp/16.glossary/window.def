window - Now obsolete, this term was used in (at least) two senses in
pre-4.0 versions of GRASS.  The term @glossary("geographic region",16.glossary/georeg.def) replaces the
term geographic window, to denote a rectangular portion of a larger
mapped area; e.g., a rectangle surrounding Colorado and excluding other
geographic areas from analysis and/or display.  

The term @glossary("graphics display frame",16.glossary/graphframe.def) replaces the term graphics window,
to denote the changing of the display area on the graphics monitor.
The setting of the geographic region can affect the data contained
in the user's dataset, while the setting of the graphics display frame
affects only the display and printing of data.
