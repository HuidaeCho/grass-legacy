map generalization - The process of reducing the detail of spatial
features in a @glossary("map layer",16.glossary/maplayer.def).  Often undertaken in conjuction with
a reduction in @glossary("map scale",16.glossary/scale.def).  The process can be semi-automated for
certain kinds of data, such as  features, but requires
more sensitive analysis for thematic maps.  See also @glossary("reclass",16.glossary/reclass.def).
