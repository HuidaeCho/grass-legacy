band file - A digital file depicting a remotely-sensed @glossary("image",16.glossary/img.def) in
terms of spectral reflectance values within some specific @glossary("band",16.glossary/band.def)
on the electromagnetic spectrum.  LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM)
images typically represent data in each of the seven bands, while
LANDSAT Multispectral Scanner (MSS) images contain four bands of
data and @glossary("SPOT",16.glossary/spot.def) color images offer three bands of data.  Panchromatic
images represent data in terms of a single band.
