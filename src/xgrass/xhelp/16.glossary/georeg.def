geographic region - A rectangular area (region), stated in the
@glossary("map coordinate system",16.glossary/mapcoord.def) of the GRASS location under which the region
is stored, whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.  A geo-
graphic region also has an east-west @glossary("resolution",16.glossary/res.def) and a north-south
resolution associated with it, which specify the dimensions used
by individual @glossary("cells",16.glossary/cell.def) falling within the region's boundaries.

NOTE: In earlier versions of GRASS, the term "geographic window" was
used to denote a geographic region.
