arc - GRASS @glossary("vector maps",16.glossary/vecmaps.def) are stored in an @glossary("arc-node",16.glossary/arcnode.def) representation
consisting of non-intersecting curves called arcs.  An arc (a.k.a.,
@glossary("vector",16.glossary/vector.def)) is stored as a series of x,y coordinate pairs.  The two
end-points of an arc are called @glossary("nodes",16.glossary/node.def).  Two consecutive x,y pairs
define an arc segment (a.k.a., line segment).  Arcs, either singly
or in combination with other arcs, form higher-level @glossary("map features",16.glossary/mapfeat.def):
line features (e.g., roads or streams) and @glossary("area",16.glossary/area.def) features (e.g.,
soil types or timber cutting units).  Areas are also called @glossary("polygons",16.glossary/polygon.def).
GRASS vector format does not store the polygons explicitly; they are
reconstructed by finding the particular arcs which form the polygon
perimeter.  Arcs that form linear features are sometimes called
@glossary("lines",16.glossary/line.def) and arcs that outline areas are called area edges or area
lines.
