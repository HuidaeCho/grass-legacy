cell - The fundamental unit of information in a @glossary("raster",16.glossary/rastdata.def) map.  In 
their raster format, a grid containing rectangular cells of uniform
size is superimposed over map data.  Each cell is assigned a value
(a.k.a. @glossary("category value",16.glossary/catval.def)) and label (a.k.a. @glossary("category label",16.glossary/catlab.def))
describing the type of data found there.  Each cell is also associated
with a specific geographic x,y, coordinate location.  In GRASS, the
user specifies cell dimensions in the x (east-west) and y (north-
south) directions, for each map; these may differ.  Grid cell size is
linked to map @glossary("scale",16.glossary/scale.def) and @glossary("resolution",16.glossary/res.def).  Smaller grid cells enable the
assignment of more values to a given area, and are therefore associated
with a larger scale and a finer resolution, than are larger grid cells.
