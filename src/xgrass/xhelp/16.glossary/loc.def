location - A directory containing the GRASS mapsets accessible by a
user within a given GRASS session.  All mapsets stored under the same
GRASS location must use the same @glossary("map coordinate system",16.glossary/mapcoord.def).  Typically,
each GRASS location stores mapsets whose data are referenced to the
same geographic region on the earth's surface.  Each location directory
contains the special @glossary("mapset",16.glossary/mapset.def) "PERMANENT" and other user mapsets.
The variable $LOCATION_NAME denotes the user's current GRASS location.
