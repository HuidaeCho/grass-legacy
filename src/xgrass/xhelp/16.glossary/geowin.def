geographic window - A rectangular region, stated in the
@glossary("map coordinate system",16.glossary/mapcoord.def) of the user's current GRASS location, whose
sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.  A geographic window also
has an east-west @glossary("resolution",16.glossary/res.def) and a north-south resolution associated
with it, which specify the dimensions assumed by @glossary("cells",16.glossary/cell.def) within the
geographic window.

NOTE:  This term is now obsolete.  Geographic windows are referred to
as "geographic regions" in GRASS version 4.0.
