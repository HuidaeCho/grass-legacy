Boolean operations - Mathematical operations which perform logical
combinations of data, involving union, intersection, complement and
exclusion.  GRASS analysis programs like @man("r.weight"), @man("r.combine"),
@man("r.infer"), and @man("r.mapcalc") can be used to perform Boolean operations
on one or more maps.
