Digital Elevation Model (DEM) - A file with terrain elevations
recorded at regular intervals on a fine-grained grid and 
organized by USGS quadrangle; the @glossary("digital",16.glossary/digdata.def) equivalent of the
elevation data on a @glossary("topographic map",16.glossary/topomap.def).  Currently available at
two different @glossary("resolutions",16.glossary/res.def); 1-degree DEM have a resolution of
roughly 100 meters and are produced from @glossary("DMA",16.glossary/dma.def) @glossary("DTED-1",16.glossary/dted.def) elevation
data, while 7.5 minute DEM have a resolution of roughly 30 meters
and are produced from contour @glossary("overlays",16.glossary/overlay.def) or NHAP quad-centered
photographs.
