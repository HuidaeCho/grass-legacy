attribute - In GRASS, data are categorized by their distinguishing
characteristics (a.k.a., attributes or categories), such as depth to
water table, soil moisture, etc.  In a map layer, each unique attribute
type is tagged with a unique integer value called a @glossary("category value",16.glossary/catval.def)
and a @glossary("category label",16.glossary/catlab.def) describing the category contents; each map can
contain category values within the range +/- 2 to the 31.  Attribute
values may be assigned to points (a.k.a., sites), linear features,
and area features.
