Bob,

I have added support for context help into the Glossary, but I have not
written any help text.  I'll let you write whatever you want.  There are
8 places where help text is available.

The dialog itself
The keyword search button
The match list
Each letter button shows a generic message
The "other" button
The keyword dialog
The keyword dialog text field
The keyword dialog match list

If you try to access the context help now, xgrass will tell you that it
can't find the file.  You'll need to create the 8 files and put help
text in them appropriate for each setting.  Make sure you create the
files in /xgrass/src/help/xgrass - you'll need to cd ..;make help to
actually install them as usual.

Xgrass will tell you what the proper file names are for each of the
above items, but here they are:

"xgglossary_dialog"
"xgglossary_keyword_search_button"
"xgglossary_match_list"
"xgglossary_generic_letter"
"xgglossary_other_button"
"xgglossary_keyword_dialog"
"xgglossary_keyword_input"
"xgglossary_keyword_match_list"

So, for example, to create the help text for the dialog itself,

cd /xgrass/src/help/xgrass
vi xgglossary_dialog (enter the text you want to show)
cp xgglossary_dialog /xgrass/src/install/lib/help/xgrass (install one file)
cd /xgrass/src
xgrass (test it out)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Eric
