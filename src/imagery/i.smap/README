        This is a compressed and tarred directory containing
        the test images used in the paper:
             C. Bouman, M. Shapiro
             "A Multiscale Model for Bayesian Image Segmentation"
             IEEE Trans. on Image Processing
             vol. 3, no. 2, pp 162-177, March 1994.

        This data is useful because it has been used by a number
        of authors to compare algorithms.
