The test only works if  the  covariance  matrix  is  non-negative
definite (sometimes  called positve semi-definite), and this is a
requirement of the maximum-likelihood estimator.  This assumption
is  theorically  true  for random samples of normally distributed
data, but for imagery data this is not generally the  case.   The
matrix  inversion/determinanat  routine  should  enforce positive
semi-definiteness. I could not tell if  it  did  this.   I  don't
think  it does.  A necessary condition is that the determinant be
positive but this is not sufficient. All  principal  minors  must
also have non-negative determinants.
