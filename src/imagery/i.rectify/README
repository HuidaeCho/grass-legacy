This is a diff for i.rectify
                                                                                
Could you test it? Works for me...                                              
                                                                                
The bug arise only when you get the default region in i.rectify (option '1'). 
If you get manually the (same) full region (option '2'), you don't have the
bug.   
It was due to the structure "target_window" not being initialised.              
                                                                                
PS. This is NOT based on a knowlege of the internals of the GRASS API, but      
rather on a little brain storming. My solution is maybe not so good???

PS: it's obviously the same for i.rectify2.
