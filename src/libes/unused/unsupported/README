			GRASS RELEASE 3.0

  The code contained in the subdirectories was used in GRASS 2.0 when
  DLG OPTIONAL FORMAT was used as the standard vector format for GRASS.

  GRASS has since changed to its own in-house DIGIT vector format for GRASS
  3.0 .  The code supporting DLG is still available here but will not be
  compiled by GISGEN or supported by GRASS.

  The library ../mapdev/libes/libdev.a is uncompiled, because it is only used
  by the DLG programs.
