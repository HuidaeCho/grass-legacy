This library contains routines called both by client and drivers.

The low level communication is in the xdr*.c files. The routines
All the xdr*.c files create and destroy and XDRS structure.
the xdr_destroy() calls fflush() on the FILE * which is necessary
for the communication along both pipes to work properly.

The client stubs are in c_*.c files.

The driver implementation for any routine, say db_xxxx() is
to be named db_driver_xxxx().

The drivers must write the db_driver_xxxx()
For example
	db_ls()        /* client routine */
	db_driver_ls() /* driver routine */
