BUGS: The following "bugs" have been found in the 5.0 version of the GUPTA
sqlroutr.a library:

*   sqlcnc() - connect to a database

	 this routine misuses longjmp(). xcodecenter will not proceed.
	 (prehaps only if the database requested doesn't connect)

*   sqletx() - get (extended) error message

	 the txtlen parmameter is set to a rediculous value upon
	 return.

*   If the any of the .SQL files (ERROR.SQL) are missing, the library
    routines print error messages to STDOUT and EXIT!!  This messes up the
    driver which needs to control the printing of error messages.  The
    effect is that clients get a protocol error from the driver.

*   Some library routines [sqlcnc() and sqlcsv()] print the message
	    'just use 3'
	    'just use 4'
    to stderr. In the driver, I had to freopen("/dev/null","w",stderr)

NOTES:
* the C/API seems to also look for the $SQLBASE env variable
  for a place to search for SQL.INI, ERROR.SQL, et al files.

* If a user is given connect prvis with a password of SYSADM, then
  no password need be provided to connect to the database.

* When creating a database, I wanted to give PUBLIC connect privs.
  However, SQLBASE doesn't allow the user PUBLIC to be granted connect privs;

  If SQLBASE system is used for GRASS master database, then the following
  must be done:

  (1) create the database using the driver
  (2) grant connect to anybody identified by SYSADM
  (3) grant select/update on all user tables some fictious user (eg., anybody)
  (4) setenv GRASSMASTER DRIVER:SERVER:grassmaster/anybody:
       note the databasename has the /anybody user added. This will
       connect to the grassmaster as the user 'anybody'

STARTING THE SERVER:
    cd /SQLBASE
    dbu20srvr silent=2

    [the 20 is for the 20 user server]
    [silent=2 will run the server in background]

PRIVS:
    I think SQLBASE handles privs like this:

	if user is a DBA
	    if no explicit entry in sysprivs tables, then granted
	    else ??? (can a DBA be denied privs? don't know this yet)
	if user is owner of the table
	    if no explicit entry in sysprivs tables, then granted
	    else ??? (can owner be denied privs? don't know this yet)
	else whatever privs PUBLIC is given.
    
    I think that there is no explicit way to deny privs.  If the privs
    are not granted explicitly, they are denied unless the user is the
    table owner or a dba.  (This is the real difference between revoke
    and deny - can't deny the owner or a dba)

INSERT/UPDATE of DATETIME with CURRENT date/time

    I hacked this one. If the current date/time is requested (in the dbValue)
    then I convert the current Unix time to an internal SQLBASE date/time
    and insert/update this value. (See current_dt.c)

    A problem here is that Unix time is only to the nearest second, while
    database times have fractions of a second.

    It should NOT be done this way, since server/database time may be
    different. There should be a way to ask the database system
    explicitly to insert/update with current time.
