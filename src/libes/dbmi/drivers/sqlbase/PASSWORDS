********************************* Database passwords ****************

The sqlbase driver will read the file

    $HOME/.sqlbase/db.passwd

to find passwords for databases. Each line of this file has
the format:

    dbname/username/passwd

The username is optional. If omitted, the line looks like

    dbname//passwd

and the driver fills in the username with the name of the Unix user.


WARNING: lines of the form
	    dbname/passwd 
	are incorrect and would be interpreted as
	    dbname/username
	(meaning no password info for username)

********************************* Server passwords ****************

The sqlbase driver will read the file

    $HOME/.sqlbase/server.passwd

to find passwords for servers. Each line of this file has

    server/passwd

********** NOTES ****************

This design doesn't allow 2 databases to have the same name (one for
one server, another for a second server).
