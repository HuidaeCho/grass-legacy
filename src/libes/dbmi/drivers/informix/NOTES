This driver has to behave differently for the standard engine vs the
online engine. The routine informix_engine() can be used to determine
the engine.  (Look at engine.ec for the way this was implemented).

The engine determines how the database env external to SQL is managed.
This mostly will effect the logic for:

	create-database  ***
	drop-database    ***
	open-database

	list-databases
	find-database
	etc.

anything that has to do with the 'dbpath' - how/where the engine looks
for databases.

*** means that I have coded something to distinguish SE from ONLINE
