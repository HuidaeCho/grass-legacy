              Imagery Georeferencing Programs

 Three programs are created from this directory:

   ../bin/geo.quest    (used to tell if there is a digitizer) 
   ../bin/geo.reg      (calls  etc/dig_drivers/<digitizer_name>/geo.reg)
   ../bin/geo.point    (calls  etc/dig_drivers/<digitizer_name>/geo.point)
   ../bin/geo.unlock   (used to unlock digitizer)


 libgeo.a is also created from this directory.


 In /usr/grass3/etc there is a directory 'dig_drivers' for storing programs
 related to the digitizers.  Inside the 'dig_drivers' directory, each digitizer
 has its own directory with its own programs.

 There are two other programs that are created:
 (../etc/dig_drivers/<digitizer_name>/geo.reg,
 (../etc/dig_drivers/<digitizer_name>/geo.point,
 but they are created by each driver's Gmakefile and they happen to link with
 'libgeo.a' at compile time.

 All the programs in ../bin exit with a 0 if all went well otherwise they
 exit with a non-zero value.
