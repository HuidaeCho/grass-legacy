/*  file includes functions that are digitizer depend, but don't directly
*   call the digitizer 
*
*  D_cursor_buttons() - tells the calling program if this digitizer has 
*   at least five digitizer cursor keys to use.
*
*  D_start_button()  - tells the calling program what number the digitizer
*  cursor starts with.
*
*  D_ask_driver_raw()  -  is the heart of the effort to using the digitizer
*   cursor keys for input.
*     return which key or button was hit on the digitizer.
*
*********************    WARNING ******************
*    In ask_driver_raw():
*   if your digitizer seems to be hanging up and the left light
*   digitizer cursor is SOLID red it may mean that the computer is outrunning
*   the digitizer.    you can up the time in the delay() calls to give your
*   digitizer some extra time.
*
*   D_setup_origin() - sets digitizer origin (if needed) and calls the device
*   driver to set anything else that is needed at startup.
*
*   D_read_raw() - reads raw coor. from the digitizer, exits on read error.
*
*  delay() - used by the driver to delay for a split second.
