 Documentation for Kurta series III.
 16 button cursor.

 'digit' is using the kurta output binary format 2.  cursor buttons are used
 in this device driver.

 Switch settings of kurta digitizer for 'digit'.  These are for series III.
 PROGRAM switches:  1100 0000       (1 - on/up, 0 - off/down)
 		Mode/Baud:  1000
	
 These settings give remote (request),  1000 PPI, english, and binary output
 format 2,  at 9600 baud.


 Data Output Resolution:		pg. 9

				 English			Metric

	(low)  'E':  200 PPI			203.2 PPI (80 points per centimeter)
	(high) 'F':  1000 PPI			1016  PPI (400 points per centimeter)

	default is 1000 PPI.

 Request Output:

	When in request mode (which digit runs), prompt the digitizer for output
	by sending it a "2" .

 Output Rate:				pg. 11

	Max of 50 X Y pairs per second at 9600 baud.
	Max of 100 X Y pairs per second at 19.2K baud.


 Origin Selection:			pg. 11

	Origin will be in the lower left corner and is fixed in this position
	unless a set origin control input character is sent to the digitizer.


 Accuracy (+ 1 LSB):		pg. 14

	Standard is +/- .01 inch with cursor.


 Notes:
	Kurta does not remember any programmable commands after a reset or the
	power is turned off.

	Ascii output bytes are multiplied by a power of 10. 
	Binary output is multiplied by power of 2.

	X and Y are same resolution.

	Status is the number of the button pushed on the cursor, unless the 
	digitizer is in remote (request) mode;  then its always 0.

 Problems:

	Can only get output from kurta for format 8 in remote (request) mode.

	Format  7 is sporadic in point mode.  Meaning that the characters read
	have no pattern.
