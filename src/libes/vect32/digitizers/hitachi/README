  This driver was written by Jim Hinthorne, CWU.
  I have made a diagnostic program in the Diagnostic directory, made some
  slight changes to the code, and documented switch settings and cable
  configurations.  The switch settings and cable configurations are in
  the troff'able  file "hitachi.doc", which is in this directory.

  WARNING:  I checked this out for Berkley Unix only.  I did not check it out
  for SYSV.  Be aware of how the tty is opened.  (CS8 or CS7)
