---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some proposals for library re-design:

all data/metadata that are currently hardcoded into the libraries should be
read from files from the etc directory of the GISBASE, or if they are
project/location dependend, they should be read from a file in
$GISDBASE/$LOCATION_NAME/PERMANENT/filename.

Functions should be added to read these values.

The files are:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
element_list, this should be unified with tcltkgrass array
              featuredir/Featuredir

units (distance, area), there should be a central registry for all units
              that go into PROJ_UNITS etc.

colors, there should be a central registry file for all available colors,
              maybe in the format "color-name r g b" or such.

methods, where is this used except in tcltkgrass?
