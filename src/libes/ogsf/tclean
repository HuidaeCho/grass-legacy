/* Ray-Convex Polyhedron Intersection Test 
 * originally by Eric Haines, erich@eye.com
 *
 * This test checks the ray against each face of a polyhedron, checking whether
 * the set of intersection points found for each ray-plane intersection
 * overlaps the previous intersection results.  If there is no overlap (i.e.
 * no line segment along the ray that is inside the polyhedron), then the
 * ray misses and returns 0; else 1 is returned if the ray is entering the
 * polyhedron, -1 if the ray originates inside the polyhedron.  If there is
 * an intersection, the distance and the nunber of the face hit is returned.
