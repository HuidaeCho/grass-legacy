/* 
Given a polygon in 2D, cut through ALL surfaces along the polygon edges,
defining new rules for drawing the surfaces so that either ONLY INSIDE
or ONLY OUTSIDE surface polygons are draw and surface polygons exactly
match edges of polygons, then draw walls using rules for color
like COLOR_ABOVE, COLOR_BELOW, or COLOR_BLEND.
