History:
 - There has been a former grid3d library written by Roman Waupotitsch,
   with input from Mike Shapiro, Helena Mitasova, Bill Brown
   et al.
 - Later Mark Astley ported grid3d to g3d library which is now widely used
   for g3d modules.


See 
src.contrib/GMSL/g3d/src3d/BUGS
for severe g3d bugs.

The G3D-API is described in

I digged out old emails with Roman about g3d and put those that seemed to       
be relevant at                                                                  
                                                                                
I am not sure whether they are useful at all
