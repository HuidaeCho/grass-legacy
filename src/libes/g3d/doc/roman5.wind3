hi, i ran the program today. and could not see any problem in the
output data. let me know if the problem still exists please.

i fixed the WIND3 problem. the problem was in my error message.
(bill you need to install a default WIND3 file in the PERMANENT
mapset)

since i was already at it i took the liberty to move bills/mikes
"r3" programs into the raster3d directory. after fixing some 
dependentcies you can now recompile all the r3 programs with one
gmake in directory raster3d.
