i have not implemented mask at this point, but it won't be a lot of work.
i suggest that the functionality will be slightly different from the 2d 
grass. there will be only one type of read and get function (in 2d there is 
one read with mask and one without mask) and one additional funcction which
turns masking on or off. is this a bad idea? it's no problem to use the
original 2d scheme for me otherwise. 

i cc this mail to bill and let him be the judge.
