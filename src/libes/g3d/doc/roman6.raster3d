hi,

i just finished implementing windows, except for the commandline 
support.

there is now one additional argument for openCellOld, which 
specifies the window to be used for this map. you can use the
default window also. it is initially the window stored in 
WIND3, or the window set with G3d_setWindow. the window of
a map can be modified even after the map has been opened. with
G3d_setWindowMap. (btw all of these functions are in the doc)

the get{Value,Double,Float} functions return now the values relative
to the window. there are three functions get{Value,Double,Float}Region
which have the previous functionality of get{Value,Double,Float}, i.e.
they return values relative to the coordiante of the data-cube on file.
instead of getRegionCoordinates one should use getWindowCoordiantes
if you use the windows.

if you want to make a program work with and without window you can
(after opening) set the window to the region of the map.

I have adapted all the programs in the raster3d directory to the new
notation, i.e. they use the "region" versions of the "get" functions.
can you please test each program at least once to make sure i did
not miss anything. maybe you can even make them use windows.

the window verions of the get functions use by default a nearest
neighbor scheme. this can be set before or after (i forgot) the
map is opened. so you can add your on re-sampling.

the things which have to be done are:

	document every new g3d function (i will do this next)
	write a consistent commandline window interface.
	make windows for writing also?
