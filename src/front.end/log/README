Testlog is a prototype of a program to write log entries documenting
the use of grass programs.  

There are two versions:

Version 1:  can be used with front.end without modification.

	  one function:  log_write (program name, logfilename)
	  
		  --just before progr is called, adds an entry to named logfile.
		  entry names target prog, date and time, user name.

Version 2:

	  depends on system calls in front.end; since log writing only takes
	  palce after target program is terminated and returned from.

	  Uses two functions:
	  
		   log_start(program name, log filename)
   
      sets up info for a log entry to be written after the program called
	  via front.end is done. to be called from front.end. once actual program 
	  name is clear, but before the actual call to the target program.
	  
		   quit_log()

	  to be called after the target prg exits. makes a single-line log entry
	  in the file specified in call to log_start.  entry includes target
	  program name, user, date, elapsed time, etc.
