Attached is version  with new options for vectors:                                                         
                                                                                                           
- cwidth > plotted line width  =  cwidth * category                                                        
                   ( usefull for any continuous quantity parameter such                                    
as flow in rivers)                                                                                         
- offset  > plots parallel line in offset distance                                                         
- coffset > offset distance = coffset * category                                                           
                    ( combination  of cwidth + coffset makes available                                     
display parameters                                                                                         
                       in each direction such as traffic on roads)                                         
- lpos - position in legend (0-omit, repeated number - merge more                                          
vectors in one row)                                                                                        
                                                                                                           
These options are not implemented in interactive mode yet.

  Dear GRASS Team,
  
  I want to offer to you ps.map.new. 
It is copy of ps.map from Grass5.beta5 with new options:

acolor  r g b       - for plotting vector areas and
label label for map - for legend labels of vectors   

and few little changes.

If you accept it to official distribution and if you want
my next changes for this module (which I want to do)
please send me instructions (or URL) 
how to go on to avoid conflicts with other contributors.
I have some instructions but it seems to be old. 

I am in doubts how latitude-longitude areas should be correctly
handled because d.vect displays boundaries in different way
from d.area and v.digit or v.build builds areas. So this
module works with LL areas as d.area, v.digit and v.build.
It means that it doesn't calculate shortest way between points
and the same adjusting is done for one area instead of each point.     

Tested only on Linux RH6.0

Please send me comments anyway.
