Here you find some definitions for postscript drivers.



Installing is _very_ easy:

1. cd /usr/local/grass42 (or whereever you stored the package)

2. Store the psdriver-package there and unpack it
    
   tar xvfz psdriver.tar.gz
 
3. Have fun!

   If you want to change these layoutfiles, go to
   cd etc/paint/ps.devices/

   Edit the files there (or create your own).

4. Use the drivers with
    ps.select and
    ps.map


That is all...
