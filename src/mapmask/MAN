mapmask - create cellfile masks based on user specified
          polygons (geometric shapes, not polygonal data) 
          from map layers

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mapmask
.SH DESCRIPTION
.na
.I Mapmask
provides the user with the capability to define specific
.I areas\ of\ interest
within a map layer.  These can
.br
be specified using
regular\ geometric\ shapes, circles, or strings of corner coordinates.
The user has the choice of creating a 'generic' 1/0 map layer and/or
a 'cookie cutter' map layer.  A 'generic' map layer has cell values
of 1 within the areas of interest.  A 'cookie cutter' map layer retains
original category values from a 'source' map layer
within the areas of interest.
.PP
The effectiveness of an analysis is often dependent on the ability to clearly 
define the exact data to be studied, and to limit the data to this definition.
In geographic analysis, a common problem is found in trying to look at 
specific areas, which seldom correspond to mapped areas, or even to rectangles.
It is important for the user both to be able to define exact areas of interest
for specific analyses and to be able to quickly define general areas for an
overview.
.PP
.I Mapmask
gives the user the tools to meet these needs quickly and easily.
.PP
The user can create two types of map layers:
.PP
.ad
.ll -.5
.in +.75i
.ti -.25i
1)
A 'generic' 1/0 map layer can be created. Cells within the areas
of interest are coded with 1; cells outside the 
area, with 0.  This type of mask can be used to 
mask sections of different map layers for use in 
complicated analyses.  

.ti -.25i
2)
A 'cookie-cutter' map layer can also be created.  This
type of mask is one that retains the data from a
source map layer in the areas specified by the user.
It
.I cannot
always be masked with other map layers.

.ti -.25i
3)
The user also has the option of creating both types
of map layers.
.PP
The user of
.I mapmask
has several options available when defining areas of interest.
.PP
.ad
.ll -.5
.in +.75i
.ti -.25i
1)
The user may choose to define a circle as an 
area of interest, specifying the center (easting/northing) 
and radius of the circle.

.ti -.25i
2)
The user may choose to define a regular polygon
as an area of interest, specifying the center 
(easting/northing) and radius of a circle which
circumscribes the polygon and the number of
sides the polygon will have.

.ti -.30i
3a)
The user may choose to define a specific polygonal
area, specifying the number of edges the area 
is to have (up to 50) and the coordinates 
for each corner of the area.  In this case, the 
corners of the area must be entered in a clockwise
order, though any corner can be first.

.ti -.30i
3b)
The user may choose to define a specific polygonal
area, specifying a file in which the coordinates
for the corner points have previously been entered.
In this case, the coordinates must be
arranged such that there is one coordinate pair per
line, with the Northing in the first column, Easting
in the second.
.na
.PP
.I note:
These four options apply to each area of interest that is designated, so a user
could have one circle, one regular hexagon, and a specific polygonal area
of interest all within one map layer.
