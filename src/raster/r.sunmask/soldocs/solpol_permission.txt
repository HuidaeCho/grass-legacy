Dear Mr. Neteler,

I have the OK you need, but you might want to wait a few days. I am 
working to get the latest version, SOLPOS 2.0, online. In SOLPOS 2.0 
the code has been converted to structures and subdivided into 
functions. Also a small error in the calculation of the declination 
angle has been corrected.

Sincerely,
Mary Anderberg
