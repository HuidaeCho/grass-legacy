r.sunmask can be used in two ways:

a) define sun position:
r.sunmask elev=dgm25 output=dgm25.shadow alt=47.394203 azim=138.604904

b) define location, date, time
r.sunmask el=dgm5 out=shadow year=1997 month=9 day=25 hour=11 minute=15 \
          sec=0 timezone=1 north=53.75 east=7.5

--------------------------

daylight savings: Rather than convert time to GMT, the solpos
algorithm uses what is called Local Standard Time, which is generally
defined politically as an offset from GMT.  So the key is the offset from
GMT, which the solpos Time Zone parameter.  If the user specifies clock time
(different for winter and summer), he/she would have to change the Time Zone
parameter seasonally in r.sunmask (timezone parameter).
