r.in.bin 

It could still use some testing and cleaning up, but it would be good
to try on some different data.  The program require the tiff library
to build, so there is a -ltiff flag for the linker in the
Gmakefile. The Tiff library contains routines for byte swapping which
I use in the code.

I added a simple routine that automatically checks the file size
against the bytes parameter and if it does not match it exits and
suggests a new bytes parameter.

The program has three flags, -s for signed data (I have not tested
this option yet), -f to import floating point data, and -b to byte
swap data during import.

The same parameters are used as the old program. The subst parameter
has changed slightly, as it now wants a single value that it will
substitute null for.

Let me know how the program works and if it needs modification. It
would be nice to make it as flexible as possible.
