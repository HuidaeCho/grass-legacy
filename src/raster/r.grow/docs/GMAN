.SH NAME
Ggrow \- generate output layer grown by one pixel

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
Ggrow [-vb] inputlayer outputlayer
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Ggrow
generates an output layer from the input layer by
"growing" areas one pixel width.  If the -b flag is
given, output will be completely binary, regardless of
category values in the input layer.  Otherwise, cells
added through the process of growing will have
category value 1, and all other cells the original category
value of the input map layer.
The optional verbose flag [-v] provides information
on program operations during execution.
.SH NOTES
Ggrow works properly with supercell layers.
The current window setting is ignored.  Instead,
the window of the input map layer is used.
