# This is a binfer script that infers the probability of finding
# pine mountain beetles, given the input layer attributes below.
# NOTE: execute binfer as follows:
#               GRASS-GRID > binfer bugs.binfer [optional_output_cellfile]
#       if the optional argument is not given the combined map
#       will be named "binfer".
#
# Script file output keywords:
#
#     CombinedMap (Colortable) - assigns the combined map the given colortable.
#     NoCombinedMap - only generates probability maps
#                     (one for each inferred attribute value).
#     NoProbabilityMaps - only generates combined map.
#     (Colortable) can be any of the following keywords:
#               Aspect - aspect colors,
#               Grey,Gray - grey scale,
#               Histo - histogram stretched grey scale,
#               Rainbow - rainbow colors,
#               Ramp - color ramp (default),
#               Random - random colors,
#               RYG - red yellow green,
#               Wave - color wave.

# Choose the combined map colortable to be a color wave
