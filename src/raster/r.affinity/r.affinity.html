<EM><b>r.affinity</b></EM> - An raster function that classifies remote 
sensing images as well as other kinds of maps.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
     <EM>r.affinity </EM>is an  analysis	classifier based on affinity
     index of David W. Goodall,	which is quite different with
     other indices by taking into account the order of the value
     instead of	the value itself. See AFFINITY BETWEEN AN
     INDIVIDUAL	AND A CLUSTER IN NUMERICAL TAXONOMY  by	David W.
     Goodall 1968 for details. The advantage of this program is
     that it can deal with multi source data. Three kinds of data
     are supported by this program: <br>
     1.  quantitative map such as image or DTM data<br>
     2.  qualitative data such as a landcover map<br>
     3.  ranked data such as a slope class map
<p>
     It should be used as a supervised classification which 
     determines to which category each cell in the image 
     has the highest probability of belonging based on training areas
     (groups of	image pixels) chosen by	the user.
<p>
     The raster	map layer output by r.affinity is a classified
     image in which each cell has been assigned	to a spectral
     class (i.e., a category).	The spectral classes (categories)
     can be related to specific	land cover types on the	ground.
<p>
     The program will run only interactively.
<p>
     The user should first create the rast map with all the training areas
     using i.digit or in other way. Then simply type r.affinity in the
     command line without program arguments.
<p> 
<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<dl>
 <dt> <b>training_map </b>     The rast map with all the training areas

<p> 
 <dt><b> group</b>	       The imagery group contains the subgroup to
		       be classified.
<p>
 <dt> <b> subgroup</b>          The subgroup contains image files and maps, which
		       are goning to be classified.
<p>
    
 <dt> <b> class_map</b>	       The name	of a raster map	holds the
		       classification results. This new	raster
		       map layer will contain categories that can
		       be related to land cover	categories on the
		       ground.
<p>
 <dt><b>  reject_name </b>      The optional name of a raster map holds
		       the reject threshold results. It	is the
		       reject threshold	map layer, and contains
		       one calculated confidence level for each
		       classified cell in the classified image.
		       Generally those cells whose confidence
		       level is	less than  0.05	can be reguarded
		       as well classified.  One	of the possible
		       uses for	this map layer is as a mask, to
		       identify	cells in the classified	image
		       that have the lowest probability	of being
		       assigned	to the correct class.
<p>
<dt><b>   data_type </b>     The data type for every file within subgroup
                     input one number for each file.
                     1. quantitative data<br>
                     2. quanlitative data<br>
                     3. ranked data
<p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>
     The affinity classifier assumes that the attributes used in
     classification are	independent with each other. It	is better
     to	choose those images and maps which are related as less as
     possible.

         
     This program respects the region and the mask set by the user.
