.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gwhat 
is a
tool that allows the user to input one or more map points (i.e., pair of
eastings and northings),
and then be shown what is
on this map layer or other map layers at the selected locations.

The input to
.I Gwhat
can be typed in at the keyboard, redirected from a file, or piped
from another program (such as
.I Gsites ).
Each line of the input consists of an easting and a northing and
an optional label. For example:

.RS
635342.21\ 7654321.09\ site 1
.br
653324.88\ 7563412.42\ site 2

.I Gwhat
output consists of the input location and label, and, for each
map layer, the category number, and (if -f is specified) the category label in
the grid cell(s) at this location.  Here is a sample output from
.I Gwhat 
(with input as above).
