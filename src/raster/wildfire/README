This WIldfire SPread Simulation, WiSpS, package contains three GRASS 
programs r.ros, r.spread and r.spreadpath, their manual pages, and
a set of test data. 

Contents:
1	src/		directory containing the source code
2	man/man/	directory containing the manual page source files
	man/cat/	directory containing formated manual pages
3	demolocation	"Location" directory for the test data
4	doit		shell script to do WiSpS demo with the test data

File Management:
I suggest you put 1-2 into your software system directory, 3 to data directory
and 4-5 to your home directory.

Compilation:
        cd src
 	gmake5

Install the demolocation and try
        firedemo.sh
