.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B r.flow
The PPM file created is 24bit color, rawbits storage by default.
Using -G, you may force r.out.ppm to use 8bit greyscale instead.
The greyscale conversion uses the NTSC conversion:
Y = .30*Red + .59*Green + .11*Blue.  One pixel is written for each 
cell value, so if ew_res and ns_res differ, the aspect ratio of the 
resulting image will be off.
.LP
\fBParameters:\fR

.IP \fBinput\fR=\fIname\fR 18
Raster file to be converted.

.IP \fBoutput\fR=\fIname\fR 18
Name for new PPM file. (use out=- for stdout) default: <rasterfilename>.ppm

.SH NOTES

A few ppm file comments are written - the name of the GRASS
raster file, resolution, etc.  Although these are perfectly legal,
I've found one PD image utility that chokes on them, so if you need 
a commentless ppm file, use out=- > outfile.ppm. (When sending 
output to stdout, no comments are written.)
