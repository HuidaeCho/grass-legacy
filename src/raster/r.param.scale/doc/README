----------

r.param.scale

GRASS module that extracts terrain parameters from a DEM.
Uses a multi-scalar approach by taking fitting quadratic
parameters to any size window (via least squares).

Jo Wood, 27th November, 1994.

Modified to include constrained fitting, April, 1995 

Modified to include weighting matrix and double precision arithmetic,
9th May, 1995.

Modified 23rd May to inclue two separate tolerance values for feature detection.

Still to do:
	Fix bug when `constrain through central cell' option selected.
	Create colour tables for all output files (presently on features).
