Dear Markus,

sys_errlist is defined in stdio.h in RedHat 5.0,
but not in SGI 6.2, nor in Solaris. (I just checked),
hence the problem.

In fact, sys_errlist is NOT 'ANSI C' (like almost everything in GRASS),
and is NOT supposed to be used.

'sys_errlist[errno]' should be replaced with 'strerror(errno)',
which IS 'ANSI C', and which should be understood by EVERY
C compiler.

I wrote a small program (err.c) which proves that
'sys_errlist[errno]' and 'strerror(errno)' produce
the SAME results:

[err.c]
