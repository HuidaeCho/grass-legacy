If you need to convert GIF to PNG format,
you may use:

http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/gif2png/

Note (cite from above web page):
The patent probably does not cover LZW decompressors such as the one gif2png
uses; legal opinions are divided on this, there has been no court test, and
Unisys refuses to commit itself. It is possible that you may be liable if
you distribute gif2png in a commercial program, or distribute gif2png on a
for-profit basis.
