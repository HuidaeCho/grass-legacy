r.lags

GRASS function to calculate various spatial dependence measures for all
possible lags within a given image. Each measure is made by comparing two
cells only for each lag azimuth and distance. The whole image is read
once for each cell in the image, therefore is very computationally
expensive. A Sparc 2 would typically take 1 hour to calculate a 150x150
image.

V1.0 written 17.6.92 to calculate Moran autocorrelation statistic.

V2.0 written 18.7.92 to also calulate Haralick's grey-tone spatial 
dependence textural measures.

V2.1 modified 18.9.95 to conform to standard GRASS program structure.


Future improvements could include (i) Option of faster, memory intensive
option; (ii) Further lag dependent measures; (iii) Cumulative lags under
some distance weighting function. (iv) Option of ignoring/including zero
values in the calculation.
