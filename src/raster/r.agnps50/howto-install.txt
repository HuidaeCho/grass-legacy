Update for WATERSHEDDS-NCSU-GRASS-AGNPS.
------------------------------------------------------

 Compiling and installing GRASS-AGNPS:   

1. Check the first line of the  
     scripts/make_display_rules.pl 
  script to make sure
  that the path of the PERL utility on your UNIX workstation is 
  correct, for example /usr/bin/perl. Type [which perl] to  
  determine the correct path for your PERL utility if you are not sure. 


2. Start the process with:

  gmake4.2
  
This  
 - compiles and installs the executable agnps_input_1
 - compiles and installs the executable agnps_input_2a
 - compiles and installs the executable agnps_views
 - compiles and installs the GRASS hydrologic functions      
      r.cn2, r.weighted.cn
 - copies scripts into grass42/scripts subdirectory 

4. You must have a .cshrc in your directory with the following statement
   in the PATH-command: $GISBASE

   for example:
    path = ( . /usr/local/bin $GISBASE/bin $GISBASE/scripts $GISBASE/garden/bin /usr/bin )
   
   (optimize this for your machine)

   Otherwise the csh-scripts of AGNPS won't work.
 
  
That was all...



5. The test GRASS dataset,
     ansi  (in example/) 
   can be conveniently located as a subdirectory of your
   home directory; however it may reside anywhere 
   as long as the directory path is  defined when running GRASS.   
   

For the usage please read documentation/agnps2.html

For short:

 start with
   grass4.2
   d.mon x0

 and then

  1. r.agnps50.input
  2. r.agnps50.run
  3. r.agnps50.view
   
Good luck!
