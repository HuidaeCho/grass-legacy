/* This routine calculates the amount of time needed for a
   concentrated flow to occur.  The actual equation looks as
   follows...

 flow duration=slope length/flow velocity

 flow velocity=10^.5*log10(percent slope)-surface condition constant

 Note: The original equation is from the USDA-SCS (1972).
       the original equation had land slope multiplied by 100.  This
       was to convert the slope to a percent. The slope that agnps uses
       is already in percent form, so therefore there is no need to
       multiply slope by 10 as the original equation does.
 */

 /* INPUTS:
     slope        (float)=field slope as a percent.
     slope_length (float)=field slope length in feet.
     surface_condition(float)=cell characteristic that accounts for the
		effects of land use and vegetation.

    OUTPUTS:
     overland_flow_duration (float)=flow time in seconds.
