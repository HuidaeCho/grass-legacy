<B>NAME</B><p>
     r.sun - computes solar rays incidence angle raster maps for
     given time and latitude, and amount of direct solar energy
     raster maps for given day and latitude from elevation, slope
     and aspect raster files. The shading effect of surrounding
     terrain is incorporated.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b><p>
     This program computes solar rays incidence angle raster map
     incidout for given day dej, time lum_time and latitude
     latitude and amount of direct solar energy energyout  for a
     given day dej and latitude from elevation elevin, slope
     slopein and aspect aspin raster files. If elevations in the
     raster elevation map elevin are in different units than the
     mapset coordinate system, a multiplier zmult must be used.
     For instance, if elevations are in centimeters and x, y
     coordinates in meters, you should use zmult = 100. Specified
     day dej is the number where January 1 is day no.1 and
     December 31 is 365 (366).	Time lum_time must be a local
     time in decimal system, e.g.  7.5 (i.e. 7h 30m). Latitude
     must be also in decimal system and has positive values for
     northern hemisphere and negative for southern one.
     Incidence angle is angle between normal vector of given
     surface and solar ray vector. Output incidence angles are in
     degrees.  Amount of direct solar energy for given day is
     computed integrating the incidence angle between sunrise and
     sunset times. Ouput is in kW per squared meter.  The
     incidence angle and amount of direct solar energy can be
     computed without shading influence of surrounding terrain by
     default, they can be computed incorporating this influnce
     using the flag -s. In hilly areas this can lead to very
     different results!	 A declination is computed internally
     using Cooper's approximation for each day and energy input
     using solar constant 1370 kW per squared meter.  It is
     possible to compute an amount of direct solar energy for
     some time interval during the year (e.g. a vegetation
     period). This can be done using a shell script.  Elevation,
     aspect and slope input values should not be reclassified
     into coarser categories. This could lead to incorrect
     results.
 
<p>
<b>OPTIONS</b>
     The user can run this program either interactively or non-
     interactively.  The program will be run non-interactively if
     the user specifies program arguments and flag settings on
     the command line using the form:
<p>
	  r.sun [-s] elevin = name [zmult = val] aspin = name
	  slopein = name [incidout = name] [energyout = name]
	  latitude = val dej = val [lum_time = val]
<p>
     Alternately, the user can simply type r.sun on the command
     line without program arguments.  In this case, the user will
     be prompted for parameter values using the standard GRASS
     parser interface.
<p>
     Flag:
<p>
     [-s]	       Incorporates shading effect of terrain
		       (default not)
<p>
     Parameters:
<p>
     elevin=name       Use the existing raster file with
		       elevationsname as input.
<p>
     zmult=val	       Set a multiplier for elevations to val.
<p>
     aspin=name	       Use the existing raster file with
		       aspectname as input.
<p>
     slopein=name      Use the existing raster file with
		       slopename as input.
<p>
     incidout=name     Output solar rays incidence angle values
		       to raster file named  name.
<p>
     energyout=name    Output direct solar energy values to
		       raster file named  name.
<p>
     latitude=val      Set the value of latitude of given region
		       to val.
<p>
     dej=val	       Set the serial number of day to val.

     lum_time=val      Set the decimal value of time to val.
<p>
<B>NOTES</B><p>
     Solar energy is important input parameter in different
     models concerning landscape, vegetation, evapotranspiration,
     snowmelt or remote sensing.  Solar rays incidence angle can
     be effectively used in radiometric corrections in hilly
     terrain where very precise investigations are performed.
     Incidence angle multiplied by solar constant (here is used
     1370 kW per squared meter) gives irradiance which can be
     computed using r.mapcalc.
