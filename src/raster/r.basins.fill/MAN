.SH DESCRIPTION
.I gbasins.fill
generates a map layer depicting subbasins, based
on input layers for the coded stream network (where
each channel segment has been "coded" with a 
unique category number) and for the ridges within
a given watershed.  The ridges file should include
the ridge which defines the perimeter of the
watershed.  The coded stream network can be generated
as part of the 'watershed' program, but the ridges
map layer will need to be created by hand,
either through regular digitizing, or the
digitizing avaialble within display.

The resulting output map layer will
code the subbasins with category numbers matching
those of the channel segments passing through them.
A user supplied number of passes through the data is
made in an attempt to fill in these subbasins.  If
the resulting map layer from this program appears to
have holes within a subbasin, the program should be
rerun with a higher number of passes.
.SH NOTES
The current window setting is ignored.  Instead,
the window for the entire input streams map layer is used.
