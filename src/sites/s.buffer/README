This is s.buffer which generates vector buffer aroud a site point.
The area is labelled with site category.
**  Input arguements:

**        s.buffer input=site_list file to read
**                  output=vector (digit) file to create
**                  radius=radius of circle, 0=category, -1=the 4th value of site list
The buffering radius can be given. Then the buffer is the same with all
points. The value must be positive.

If the value is not given or its 0, then the radius is taken from the 
attribute of the site point.

If the radius value is negative, then the radius is taken from the 4th column
of site list. Here it's called also radius value.
