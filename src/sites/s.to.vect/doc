site.to.vect()

  --convert site_list to vect file

questions:

   --HEADER info:
		
		--name and title: get the same way as sites_to_cell
		--scale:  isn't this only relevant to actual digitizing? or
		   to the window you make?  if the latter, it's arbitary
        --make NSWE borders 1% bigger than closest sites
		--threshold = 0.0

   --cat or att size limit is 7 digits in dig_att.  might this be a problem
	  with data in sites file?  and what about negative data?


Two passes through site_list:

       1. Pass 1 read each line:
    
    	--check desc format on each line-- must be "x|y|#int desc".  
    		 set flags for ALL, SOME, or NONE
    		 if ALL desc lines are in format  #int desc
    			 set flag to good_cat_data
    		 if SOME desc lines are in format #int desc
    			 set flags some_good, 
             if NO desc lines
	
	    2. if SOME
			 print message that 1/0 file will be created; advise
			 to edit site file for more detailed vect
			
        3.  rewind site_list

		4. Pass2 through each line:

			  write dig file
              if SOME or NONE
				  dig_att file:   each line gets attr of 1

		      if ALL
				  dig_att file: use #int from site line
				  accumulate dig_cats table

        5. Write dig_cats file:

			 if SOME or NONE
				enter 0 = "no data"  1 = "sites data"
             if ALL
				enter 0 = no data
				1-n from cats table
