4th Kriging subroutine - find the kriging weights through the
maniplulation of semivar. Matrices A . x = b Parameters passed: none
What this does: This function takes the semivariance values calculated
in the 3rd Kriging function and transfers them to matrices with the
appropriate lagrange parameters.  The matrices A and b are then passed
to the numerical recipes routines which invert matrix A multiply it
with b to derive matrix x, the Kriging weights.
