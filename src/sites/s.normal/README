Compilation instructions:

1.  Next, run gmake

    % gmake5.0
 
    and your MAKELINKS script.

2.  At your discretion, you may install the man page using gmake:

    % gmake5.0 . man

    This will attempt to automatically install the man page
    (and catman) in the appropriate place. Alternatively,
    you may do it by hand.
