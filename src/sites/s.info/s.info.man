.SH NAME
\fIs.info\fR \- Reports attribute, label, and other information about a sites file.
.br
.I "(GRASS Sites Program)"
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBs.info\fR
.br
\fBs.info help\fR
.br
\fBs.info\fR [\fB\-qwQ\fR] \fBsites=\fIname\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBs.info\fR reads the entire sites file and reports header & label information,
type of category, number of attributes & dimensions, and min and max
values for each dimension, attribute, or category.  For best results sites
should conform to the multiple attribute format as specified in floating point 
GRASS.
.P
This program can be run non-interactively or interactively.
If the user gives the name of a GRASS site_lists map and
(optionally) specifies other parameter values on the command
line the program will be run non-interactively;  any
parameter values left unspecified are set to their default
values (see below).  Alternately, the user can type simply
s.info on the command line; in this case, the program will
prompt the user for parameter values using the standard
GRASS parser interface described in the manual entry for
parser.

.SH "COMMAND LINE OPTIONS"
.LP
Flags
.IP \fI-q\fR
Load quietly
.IP \fI-w\fR
Only count sites in current window for min/max.
.IP \fI-Q\fR
Show quartiles for decimal attributes
.LP
Parameters
.IP \fIsites\fR
Name of sites file.

.SH BUGS
If the \fI-Q\fR flag is given, the sites are cached in order to 
determine quartile values; otherwise
the sites are read sequentially without caching.  Therefore,
use of the \fI-Q\fR option may result in an out-of-memory error for
very large sites files.
.P
The algorithm used to find quartile values matches that used by
\fBs.univar\fR, so if the number of sites is not evenly divisible
by 4, the resulting Q1 and Q3 values may not exist in the data,
but is an average of the two neighboring values.  Likewise, if
the number of sites is not evenly divisible by 2, the resulting 
median will be an average of its neighbors.
