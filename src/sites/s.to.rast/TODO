#    Should accept site list without #cats field:
#    
#    Example:
#    x-coord|y-coord|%decimals
#    x-coord|y-coord|%decimals
#    x-coord|y-coord|%decimals
#    
#    Currently just a binary map is created instead of
#    a floating point raster map.

# o Warn user if cells get written more than once.
Warning should be working... (10/15/200 Eric G. Miller)
