NAME
       m.in.e00 - Read an ESRI e00 file

SYNOPSIS
       m.in.e00
       m.in.e00  input=name [mapset=name] [action=what to do] [verbose=debug level] [logfile=name]

DESCRIPTION
       The  m.in.e00  program is designed to import ESRI Arc/Info
       e00 ascii archives.  The input file must be in  ascii  (no
       binary compressed) e00 file.

       The  program  not  only  can  analyse  the  content  of an
       Arc/Info file, but try to  create  the  objects  described
       (geometry and attributes).
       m.in.e00  will be run non-interactively if the user speci-
       fies program arguments on  the  command  line,  using  the
       form: m.in.e00  input=name [mapset=name] [action=what to do]
       [verbose=debug level] [logfile=name]

       Alternately, the user can simply type:

              m.in.e00

       on  the  command  line without program arguments.  In this
       case, the user will be prompted for parameter values using
       the  standard GRASS user interface described in the manual
       entry for parser.

FEATURES
       M.in.e00  attempt  to  retrieve  all  information  in   an
       Arc/Info  export  file  (.e00) : points, line, polygon and
       grid coverage.   The  attribut  of  each  "vector"  object
       (points,  line,  and  polygon) is the Arc/Info coverage-ID
       (and not the coverage-#).

       Grass files created have the name extracted from the first
       line of the e00 file, i.e. the name of the coverage.

       The  following rules are used : A line vector file is cre-
       ated when there is a non-empty ARC  section,  and  neither
       PAL   (Polygon   Attribute  Label)  section,  neither  PAT
       (Point/Polygon Attribute  Table)  table  in  IFO  section.
       Otherwise  a polygon vector file is created, excepted when
       the ARC section is empty or doesn't exist, in which case a
       site file is created.

       Dig_cats  files  are  created  if  the  PAT  or  AAT  (Arc
       Attribute Table) tables  have  more  attributes  than  the
       standars  one.   If  there  is  one  extra  attribute, the
       dig_cats file has the name of the vector (dig)  file  cre-
       ated.   If  there  is  more  than one extra attribute, the
       dig_cats    files    have    names     of     the     form
       cover_name.attribute_name.   If  you  want  to  use one of
       them, you must rename it so it match the name of the  vec-
       tor  file.   Doing  this,  v.to.rast  will  use it for the
       raster file created.

OPTIONS
       mapset=name       For creating a new mapset for  the  data
                         imported.  This may be usefull, since we
                         cannot create a projection info file and
                         a  default window in an existing mapset.
                         When a file is imported in  the  current
                         mapset,  you  should take care that they
                         are in the same projection.
                         Unfortunately, you may  run  in  trouble
                         after   that  when  using  g.region  (Cf
                         BUGS).

       action=what to do Five options:  analyse,  raster,  lines,
                         vector and all.
                         By  default,  all is used and everything
                         (grid,  points,  lines,   polygons)   is
                         imported.  Analyse produce no files, but
                         only a log output (level 5)  on  stderr,
                         and  is  usefull  to see whether the e00
                         file is clean or  not.   Raster  imports
                         only  grid  section.  Lines imports only
                         the geometry (no label are  attached  to
                         the    lines    or    polygons)   of   a
                         point/line/polygon   coverage.    Vector
                         imports  a  point/line/polygon  coverage
                         with their attributes.

       verbose=debug level
                         Number between 0  (no  trace  of  what's
                         happening) and 9 (very verbose log).

       logfile=name      Name  of  file  where  log  info will be
                         written.  By  default   log   info   are
                         directed to stderr.

BUGS AND CAVEAT
       Binary  files are rejected.  You must use e00b2a before to
       convert binary e00 files to ascii.

       You must know what to do with all the dig_cats file gener-
       ated when importing a vector coverage.

       No  attribute  (cats)  file  is  produced when importing a
       grid.

       The program may crash when unexpexted data (mainly in  IFO
       section) are found, or when the input file is corrupted.

       There  is  no  support for projection. using verbose=1 let
       you see the parameters of  the  e00  file,  but  you  must
       create the DEFAULT_WIND and the PROJ file yourself.

       New  mapset  are  allways created with proj=0 zone=99.  If
       the default proj and zone are not the same, g.region  com-
       plaints  and d.vect or d.rast refuse to display your data.
       The only thing to do is to import in the current mapset.
