m.in.e00 now understands uncompressed _and_ compressed e00 files
(thanks to Daniel Morisette), so e00b2a can be thrown away (A far
better alternative is to use the e00compr package from Daniel
Morisette (http://pages.infinit.net/danmo/e00/index-e00compr.html).

Site file management is done accordingly the new site API

m.in.e00 can now import float grid (not only integer ones)

Usualy, each object (site, line or area) in Arc-Info has two identifiers :
COVER-# is an internal number that should NEVER be used to link a
feature to an external database (those number may change if you
modify (add, delete, etc.) the coverage.
COVER-ID is a user defined number that is used to differentiate
each object in a coverage.
Some peoples using A/I doesn't take care of this and rely only on
COVER-#, giving the same cover-ID to differents objects.
This is the reason why I choose to use by default COVER-# for the
attribute in Grass, although this is not a recommended practice.
The flag -i allows you to use cover-ID, which is better is the A/I
database follows the ESRI rules and you will keep consistency between
A/I and Grass objects identifiers.
When the attributes seems to be misplaced, even without using the
-i flag, it may shown that the original A/I file is corrupted (or
that m.in.e00 is even worse that I think :-)

TODO : the flag -d means that you want a database output. It has
yet absolutely no action... We wait all for a good interface to
postgreSQL, so be patient :-) 
It would also be great to import all attributes in the site file,
