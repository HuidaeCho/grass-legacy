Source Codes

Census Feature Class Codes (CFCC)

This is a series of codes that provides more detailed information on the 
classification of the line segment, such as class of road, class of stream,
and so forth.  This field provides more information than the 1980 GBF/DIME-
File "NS" code (nonstreet feature code) field.  For line segments that 
originated with the USGS DLG-3 files, the CFCC is based on the USGS 
classification code in the DLG-3 file.  For line segments that originated 
with the 1980 GBF/DIME-Files, the CFCC is based on the NS code and other 
feature identification content of the GBF/DIME-File.  A list of these codes
follows.

The interstate highways that were identified by name as such in the 
GBF/DIME-File, are classified as Class 1 roads.  Also, in the GBF/DIME-File
coverage areas, users may not find many roads with alternate names; if an 
alternate name is provided, it usually represents another local name and 
not a Route Number.

CFCC    CLASSIFICATION X = FEATURES NOT YET CLASSIFIED

X00     Feature Not Yet Classified

Note:  The list of census feature class codes provides for the possible 
inclusion of these types of features.  For example, a property line will 
appear in the file only when a statistical or political boundary is known 
to follow that property line, and only then will a line carry the F40 
property line code.

FEATURE TYPE ABBREVIATIONS

For all hydrography and for all nonroad features, the feature type normally
will follow the feature name in the feature name field.  If the feature 
type is not one of the types that appears in the following list, the 
feature type will appear in the feature name field.  Roads normally will 
have an entry in the feature type field.  The feature type is present only 
when it is part of the proper name.  One should not confuse proper name 
feature types with the census feature class codes (CFCC).

The following entries may appear in the feature type field.  These name 
abbreviations also may appear in the feature name field.
