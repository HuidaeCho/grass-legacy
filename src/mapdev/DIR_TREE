dig_front    -  Dir: Contains programs ' ../bin/digit, a.b.vect, b.a.vect, 
                import.to.vect'  and the digitcap file information.
digit        -  Dir contains 'libdigit.a' and source code to build it.
digitizers   -  Dir contains a directory for each digitizer driver and this
	        is where the drivers are compiled from.

			    NOTES

  Other libraries that MAPDEV is responsible for: 
  ../src/libes/dlg, ../src/libes/dig_att

  Other programs that MAPDEV is responsible for: 
  ../src/D/prog_cmd/vect (Dvect) , ../src/D/prog_cmd/vect.dlg (Dvect.dlg)

  If other programs wish to access mapdev data files they will have to go
  through ../src/libes/libdig_att.a  for the dig_att files

	OR

  ../src/mapdev/lib/libdig.a  for the dig and dig_plus files.
  Two important files in ../src/mapdev/lib are level_one.c and level_two.c
