added v.support check - 7/98 Markus Neteler neteler@geog.uni-hannover.de

-----------------------------------------------------------------
So for the benefit of the grass community, there is a new
dig_prune function, commented (in bad english), that should
replace src421/src/mapdev/diglib/prune.c (and not only for
linux version, the code is no linux dependant)

Also edited: src421/src/mapdev/v.prune/v.prune.c, replacing
the comparaison "==" by "<" in line 114 (test for Threshold != 0)
A null value just eliminates duplicate points.

The code is shorter, but the source bigger (many comments).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
4.0 conversion note -- 12-90 dks

v.prune:

cmd version source   = v.prune.c
inter version source = prune.c


misc. changes fr0m 3.2:

1. changed struct head in v.prune.c to dig_head

2. ***type_double doesn't complain about non-double answer??

3. changed call to find_file2 to find_vector2

4. added a check to see if *in_name or *out_name was empty (since
	 the new parser will accept empty arguments

5. fixed bug in fatal_error message when dig src file isn't found
