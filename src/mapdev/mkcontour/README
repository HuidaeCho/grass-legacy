TO DO LIST :

1.  create support file (that is implement support.vect) is requested on
on the command line.  Default: no support file created.s 

2.  write out info as one long line instead of two point lines

3.  write prgm to remove xtra lines (duplicate) only allow 2 lines to be writtenout if nodes = thresholds.

4.  specifc suggestions have been given to improve the overall speed of this
program. The limiting factor would probably be all the calls to the
write_att and dig_Write_line subroutines. 

5.  There are some obvious bugs with the contouring program as it exists but
the best solution may be to rewrite the code using method 2.  THis would
take care of #2 #4.  

6.  write linterp as a macro like WITHIN instead of subroutine
