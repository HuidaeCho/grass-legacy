** build_area_with_line ()
** this is the real guts of build area stuff
**
**  take a given line and start off to the RIGHT/LEFT and try to complete
**  an area.   
**  Possible Scenarios:
**	path runs into a dead end (no other area lines at node) : no area
**	path runs into a previous line that is not 1st line,    : no area
**	path runs into first line.   				: AREA!
**
**  after we find an area then we call point_in_area to see if the
**   specified point is w/in the area
**
**  returns  -1:  error   0:  no area    1:  point in area
**  -2: island  !!
