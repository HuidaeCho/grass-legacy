I fextension names are long, keep in mind the GRASS limit of 14 characters
for filenames.  To minimize the possibility of creating two output files
of the same name use the prefix option to abreviate the dxf file name
leaving the majority of characters available for differentiating between
layer names.

Making the dxf output directly to a vector binary file with the 
optional flag -a to output to an ascii file available on the commandline.

The v.in.dxf is now set to be tested.  To select a dxf file: (map=dxf_file)
1.  give full or relative pathname for the dxf_file
2.  be in the directory where dxf file is
