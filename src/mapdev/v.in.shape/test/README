This is an interim test package for testing
procedures and structures for converting
an ESRI Shapefile to various topological
structures, mainly binary vector formats
for the GRASS database.


REQUIREMENTS:

This test package links to Frank Warmerdam's shapefile
library. For details see 

http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/shapelib/index.html


INSTALL:

This should be untarred in the top-level directory
of a current v.in.shape module, or v.in.shape.pg.
Then enter `make'. Edit the makefile if need be
to suit your system. As these files do not depend on
the GRASS environment, they can also be installed in
a separate scratch directory, as long as the shapefile
source files dbfopen.c shpopen.c and shapefil.h are
present in the top level directory.


TEST:

The binary arctest1 is a crude shape-to-generate
converter for checking the function of the shape
import engine. It craetes a pol, lab and txt file
which can be read by the v.in.arc module. A set
of shapefiles ( .shp, .shx and .dbf ) should be 
copied to the test directory, then run arctest1

./arctest1 myfile.shp

The generate files created should be copied to
GRASS mapset's arc/ directory before import.
Import with v.in.arc.
