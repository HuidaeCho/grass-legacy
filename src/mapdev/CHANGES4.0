The following programs have been modified for GRASS4.0.  Each of the following 
is different, in one or more ways, from it's counterpart in GRASS 3.2 
([y] in inter column below means interactive version supplied by parser):

                                                               needs recompile
							       and testing

done 1.v.build   was build.vect

    --replace snap= thresh= args with flags

done 2. v.support 

      calls to build.vect:
	 v.build,, change call params to flags

      change modcats call

done 3. v.import  was import_to_vect (changed from v.in) 

         interactive version only (so far)
         calls:
	       etc/v.a.b.dlg
	       etc/v.dlg_to_digit
	       v.build
	       v.in.ascii
	       DOESN'T CALL in.dxf

	 TODO: command-line version of v.import   
	  will call  v.in.dxf, v.in.ascii, v.build, eventually v.in.dlg
	    so will need command args of ascii= vect= dlg= dxf=
		OR flags: e.g. -avd(x??)

done 4. etc/v.a.b.dlg - goes to /etc, will be called by v.in.dlg

done 5. etc/v.b.a.dlg - goes to /etc, won't be used


done in ALPHA:  7. v.out.dxf      dxf_out (was ??)
         still needs conversion to BINARY input, plus find bug, if
	 it exists, that produces pppp0 output to stderr at end!!!

done:  8. v.in.dxf       dxf_in  (was dxf2dig)

done:  9. v.cadlabel

-------------

still leaves:

v.in.dlg
      calls v.a.b.dlg and v.dlg_to_dig
      DO by extracting appropriate code from v.import

v.db -- can't do: original (Gdbvect) has fortran code, so, I just
      copied all code from /grass.src/3.2.src.new/Gdbvect to
			   /grass.src/4.0/src.contrib/Gdbvect
v.out.arc
v.out.moss
v.state.plane

**********************************************************************

1.	 changed a.b.dlg to v.a.b.dlg  bin in ../etc

2.	   "     dlg_to_digit to v.dlg_to_digit  bin in ../etc
		    in Gmakefile for this, removed bdig_head.h dependency

3.      v.import (was import_to_vect)  bin in BIN_MAIN_INTER as v.import
	 set up system calls to:
	  v.a.b.dlg
	  v.dlg_to_digit
	  v.in.ascii
	  v.build
	    IMPORTANT:  call to v.build FORMERLY set thresh=no, meaning
	      use default thresh value.  

	      NOW, from import.vect,
	      the call to v.build is either "-sp" or ""; which  means
	      snap nodes and prompt for value, or don't snap.
	      this is identical to what v.support does.

4.  all of the above are compiled and installed, but not tested. thought
i could let you do that. (along with v.support)  heh-heh

5.STILL to DO:  cmd version of v.import, etc.
