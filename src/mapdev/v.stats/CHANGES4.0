4.0 Conversion note - dks 12 - 90 

Vstat to v.stats

v.stats: command version source = v.stats.c  
	 inter source           = stats.c

old source:  formerly dig_front/stat.c

BUG NOTE:   both versions only allow you to get stats on one of your 
	 own files.  however, G_ask_vector in inter lets you ask for a file
	 you don't own, and doesn't complain as long as it exists; subsequent 
	 message from dig_P_init is ambiguous:
	   "can't open dig file"
