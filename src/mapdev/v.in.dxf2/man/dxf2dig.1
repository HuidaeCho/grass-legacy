DESCRIPTION
.ft R 

The 
.ft I
dxf2dig 
.ft R
conversion program generates GRASS dig_ascii and dig_att layers from a DXF
formatted file.  Each layer in the DXF file is converted to a separate
dig_ascii layer.  For each DXF layer containing text, a dig_att file is also
generated.  These output files are placed in the GRASS dig_ascii and dig_att directories.  The 
.ft I
dxf2dig 
.ft R
program will recognize points, lines, polylines, arcs, ellipses, circles and text in the DXF format, and will translate these to the GRASS vector format; other types of data 
are ignored.  
.br

.ft B
OPTIONS
.br

dxf=opt   
.ft R
the name of the DXF file, including its full pathname if necessary
.br

.ft B
lines=opt   
.ft R
the DXF layers where the line data resides.  Examples of line options are:
.br

	lines=ROAD			line data in DXF layer ROAD
.br

	lines=ROAD,WATER		line data in DXF layers ROAD and WATER
.br 
   
	lines=ROAD:WATER		any line data in DXF layer ROAD should be placed
.br
					in the dig_ascii file for DXF layer WATER 
.br

.br
The default command creates output for all layers found in the DXF file.  When using the option commands 
.ft I
line 
.ft R
or 
.ft I
label,
.ft R
only layer names specified will be processed.  All other layers will be ignored.
.br

.ft B
labels=opt   
.ft R
the DXF layers where the text data reside.  Options are the same as for lines.
.br

.ft B
prefix=opt
.ft R
the names of the output dig_ascii and dig_att files are formatted as 
.ft I
prefix.extension,    
.ft R
where 
.ft I
prefix 
.ft R
is the prefix of the DXF filename and 
.ft I
extension 
.ft R
is the DXF layer name.  For example, given a DXF file named
.ft I
location.dxf,
.ft R
that has line data in layer ROAD, the output dig_ascii file  
.ft I
location.ROAD
.ft R
would be created.
.br
This default action can be over-ridden by using the prefix option to specify
a new prefix for the output dig_ascii files.

NOTES
.br

.ft I
Output filenames  
.ft R
.br
The output filename, 
.ft I
prefix.extension,
.ft R
conforms with the GRASS limit of 14 characters.  The entire prefix name is used, a '.' inserted, and as much of the extension name is used as the 14 character limit will permit.  Excess characters are truncated.  To minimize the possibility of creating output files with the same names (resulting in loss of data from the DXF file) use the prefix option to abbreviate the DXF file name.  This will leave the majority of characters available for differentiating between layer names.
.br

.ft I
Translation
.ft R
.br
The translation program does not contain any of the quality control functions 
available in 
.ft I
digit 
.ft R
that will prevent improper data from getting into GRASS.  If present, DXF 
entities are placed in output file(s) corresponding to the layer names used in the DXF file. 
.br

.ft I
Editing
.ft R
.br
The resulting dig_ascii files have to be converted to binary vector format 
.ft I
(dig)
.ft R
through the program 
.ft I
a.b.vect.                 
.ft R
The vector files can be displayed at this point, using the
.ft I
Dvect
.ft R
command, but 
.ft I
support.vect
.ft R
must first be run on the 
.ft I
dig
.ft R
files before they can be edited in 
.ft I
digit.
.ft R
The ouput files may contain unsnapped nodes, overshoots, gaps, and
replicated lines.  The header information (such as owner's name, map's name,
date, and scale, and UTM zone) for the GRASS vector files can be edited in
.ft I
digit.
.ft R
.br

.ft I
Attributes
.ft R
.br
The 
.ft I
dxf2dig 
.ft R
program attaches attributes only to DXF text data that is converted to GRASS 
vector data (such as contour line labels).  Attributes are not attached to
converted DXF line data.  For each layer of text data in the DXF design file,
.ft I
dxf2dig 
.ft R
generates a vector file consisting of rectangular boxes (lines) that 
are drawn around the DXF text data, and uses the text values to create a GRASS 
attribute file for the boxes.  The vector and attribute files can then be 
used to label contour lines with the 
.ft I
Vcadlabel
.ft R
program.
.br

EXAMPLES
.ft R
.br

For a DXF design file named 
.ft I
contour.dxf
.ft R
that contains contour lines and contour line labels, where:
.br

	index contour lines are in DXF layer INDEX 
.br
	intermediate contour lines are in DXF layer INTER
.br
	index labels and some intermediate contour lines are in DXF layer NAMES 
.br

Using the default options for
.ft I
dxf2dig:
.ft R
.br

	dxf2dig contour.dxf
.br 

.ft I
which is the same as:
.ft R
.br

	dxf2dig contour.dxf   lines=INDEX,INTER,NAMES   labels=NAMES
.br

generates the following GRASS dig_ascii and dig_att files:
.br

	dig_ascii:  contour.INDEX, contour.INTER, contour.NAMES
.br
	dig_att:  contour.NAMES
.br

however, the 
.ft I
contour.NAMES
.ft R
file contains intermediate contour lines which should be in the dig_ascii
file
.ft I
contour.INTER,
.ft R
and the user would also like to change the prefix on the resulting files;
so keying in the following command:          
.br

dxf2dig cont.dxf  lines=INDEX,INTER,NAMES:INTER  labels=NAMES  prefix=cont
.br

will generate the folllowing GRASS files, in which there are no contour lines in
the text vector file:
.br

	dig_ascii:  	cont.INDEX, cont.INTER, cont.NAMES
.br
	dig_att:  	cont.NAMES
.br
