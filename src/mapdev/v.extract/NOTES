Hi Markus                                                                       
                                                                                
Here is an update for the v.extract module. The category support and            
segfault problem are hopefully now fixed.                                       
                                                                                
This module is not likely to work for vector files that are not                 
in 'arc-node' format, because its identification of lines to                    
extract depends on having a unique area on the left and right -                 
which closed loops do not have, and therefore the process gets                  
confused.                                                                       
                                                                                
We could develop a separate module for working on such files,
but I think it's better to concentrate on converting existing                   
files to native GRASS format.
