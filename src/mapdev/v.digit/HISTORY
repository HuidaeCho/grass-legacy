GRASS - v.digit

v.digit compiles, but doesn't work because an old assumption 
on Termio : in System V.2, reading a serial line without the 
need of a LF is possible, but the driver wait at least VMIN 
char on input or VTIME ms before returning anything.  
In older termio libs, VEOF=VTIME and VEOL=VMIN (or the opposite), 
but this is not true with Linux (See /usr/include/asm/termbits.h).

If you want run v.digit you should edit line 50 and 51 of the
file "set_key.c", replacing VEOL and VEOF by VTIME and VMIN.

This is for keyboard entry. I have not yet tested the digitizers,
but I'm sure that it will not work without editing "graph_input.c"
at lines 598 and 599, doing the same change.
