After two long night, I finaly have something that mimics (as far                                
as I know) the e00 format.  The boring thing was to create the                                   
"universe" polygon beloved by Arc/Info.                                                          
                                                                                                 
I would be glad if some Arc/Info owner can test the output.                                      
I something doesnt work, I will like to have an original e00                                     
file of a simple drawing (2 polygons, on with a hole, and an                                     
external isle) with straigth lines, so it's easy to import and                                   
export and to compare both.                                                                      
                                                                                                 
v.out.e00 use the Grass dig_att file for filling the attribute of                                
the coverage-ID, so if it is linked to an external database via the                              
attribute, you should get all of them in Arc/Info.                                               
                                                                                                 
Here is the program, the Gmakefile and the manual page in html.
