     vect.to.moss  -	Converts GRASS site, line, or area data
     into MOSS import format.
     (Data Export Tool)


  This program was written by Chris Emmerich, Autometric Inc. at the request of
  the GRASS Team.   The code was placed on the GRASS workstations for testing in 
  Jan. 1990.

  I had to make two changes.  The first was to add the mathlib to the Gmakefile.
  The second was to change the names of these files because they are to long for SYSV
  machines.

point_to_moss.c            ->        pnt_to_moss.c
write_moss_coordinates.c   ->        wr_moss_coor.o
write_moss_header.c        ->        wr_moss_head.o
