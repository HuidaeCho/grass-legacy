.SH NAME
Gtrim \- Trim small spurs, and remove excessive nodes in a digit file
.br
.I "(G Language Tool)"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Gtrim
.I "digit-file trimmed-file [trimming-factor]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gtrim
scans the selected \fIdigit-file\fR and removes all lines with a length 
less than the specified
trimming factor.  Excessive nodes between line junctions are also removed.
.I Gtrim
will create a new vector data file.  The original vector (digit)
file is not modified.  

The trimming parameter gives you control over the size of 
small spurs or "dangling lines" to be removed.  The trimming factor is 
expressed in the same units (coordinates) as the vector (digit) data 
within the current
Grass Location, (i.e. meters for UTM locations, and in pixels or cells
for non-UTM locations).

The default trimming factor is 10 (either meters or cells, depending
upon the current location).

.SH NOTES
.I support.vect   
must be run prior to 
.I Gtrim.

.I support.vect
must be run on the resultant files to build the dig_plus information. 

.I Gline
maintains the same format (binary or ascii) and attribute type 
(linear or area edge) as the original digit file.

A trimming factor of zero (0) will not remove any small spurs, but will 
remove all excessive nodes.
