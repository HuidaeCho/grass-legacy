These instructions assume you are in the GRASS source directory
mapdev and that a Gmake has been executed on the Gmakefile in this directory.

If you have a digitizer on your system, please do the following to
let the programs know about your digitizer (defining) and to build the digitizer
program "digit" :

1. To let the programs know where to find the digitizer it has to be described.
   This is done by editing the file in dig_front/digitcap.  There is
   information on how to edit 'digitcap' in the file dig_front/README .
   Editing 'digitcap' has to be done before going on.

	Once the file is edited to your satisfaction.  Compile it:

       gmake4.2 dig_front

2. select the appropriate driver code for your digitizer and compile the
   driver:

	  ls digitizers

	  (you will see directories for each digitizer GRASS supports select the
       directory for your digitizer and substitute its name in the next command.
       at this point on this machine we support the Kurta, Altek, Geographics,
       and the NONE (null) digitizer)

	gmake4.2 digitizers/<digitizers>

	In the case of the Altek it would be:

	gmake4.2 digitizers/altek



3. 'su' to root for the next steps

	the tty(s) the digitizer is connected to has to be setup.  this is
	accomplished by editing the  file  '/etc/inittab'.

	this is what our line for the digitizer in 'inittab' looks like:

		05:23:off:/etc/getty tty5 9600
	
	the getty must be off for tty5.
	yours will be tty? instead of tty5.


5.  still as root

		chmod 666 /dev/tty?
	
6.  still as root
 	have the computer reset the tty to reflect the changes to 'inittab':

			/etc/init 2

7.  The drivers now reside in /usr/grass3/etc/dig_drivers/<digitizer> .
		cd  /usr/grass3/etc/dig_drivers 
		chown root */*
		chmod 06775  */*
	
8.  The hardware for the digitizer should also be setup at this point.
    For specific information on your digitizer read the INSTALL file in the
    driver directory  /usr/grass3/src/mapdev/digitizers/<digitizers> .
	

NOTE:  
    Digit is a very CPU intensive program.  Having a system with other users
  on it and having a high load average can slow digit down.  If it seems that
  'digit' isn't responding rapidly enough the priority for the program may
  have to be raised.  This is accomplished by changing the file in 
  ../src/mapdev/digit/set_prior.c .  Up the priority by changing this line:
  "#define PRIORITY -13"
  Change '-13'  to  '-15' but no higher then '-16'.
  Then recompile the digitizer driver.
