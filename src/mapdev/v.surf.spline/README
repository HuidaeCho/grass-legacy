v.surf.spline -	Interpolates vector contour data by fitting a cubic spline 
		function to profiles in four directions. It has two advantages
		over other interpolation techniques: (1) The RMS Error can be 
		calculated for EACH CELL in the DEM as well as an overall RMSE.
		Spatial variation in error can examined; (2) A cubic spline has
		the property of 2nd derivative being continuous therefore having
		implications for slope measurements. Terracing effects should be
		minimised.

		Method suggested by Yoeli(1986) and discussed in Wood and Fisher
		(1993).
