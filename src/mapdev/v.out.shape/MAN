.SH INTERACTIVE MODE: USER PROMPTS
The vector file export program, v.out.shape, will prompt
you to enter the name of a GRASS vector file to be exported to 
SHAPE and for various options, see above.

A GRASS vector file to be exported to SHAPE may contain both 
LINE and POLYGON coverage. If you select type 
.B both 
for conversion, two layers will be produced with the appended
suffixes 
.B _line
and
.B _area
respectively for lines and polygons. Lines used as area edges
however are not duplicated in the lines layer. If one layer is
empty the unused files are deleted.
