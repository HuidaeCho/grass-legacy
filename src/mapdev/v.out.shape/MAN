.SH SYNOPSIS
.B v.out.shape 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I v.out.shape 
will export GRASS vectors files to SHAPE Generate format.
.SH USAGE

 v.out.shape type=name vect=name shape_prefix=name

Parameters:
        type   coverage type
               options: polygon,line
        vect   input vector file for SHAPE conversion
  shape_prefix   prefix for SHAPE output filenames


.SH INTERACTIVE MODE: USER PROMPTS
The vector file export program, v.out.shape, will prompt
you to enter the name of a GRASS vector file to be exported to 
SHAPE and for a file-name prefix to be used in naming the files
created by the program.

A GRASS vector file to be exported to SHAPE must be either a 
LINE coverage (must contain only lines) or a POLYGON coverage
(must contain only area edges).  The
.I v.out.shape 
program will begin by asking you which
type of coverage is to be imported, as follows:

.nf
      COVERAGE TYPE
     Enter "polygon" or "line"
     Hit RETURN to cancel request
     >
.fi
 
You  will then be prompted for the name of the file for export
to SHAPE:

.nf
      VECTOR (DIGIT) FILENAME 
     Enter 'list' for a list of existing binary vector files
     Hit RETURN to cancel request
     >
.fi

Next, you will asked for a file-name prefix to be used in naming
the output SHAPE Generate format files:

.nf
      SHAPE (GENERATE) FILENAME PREFIX
     Hit RETURN to cancel request
     >
.fi

The prefix you specify will be used as follows. In the case of a labelled
POLYGON coverage, three files will be created: a lines file with the suffix 
.pol, a label-points file with the suffix .lab, and a label-text file with 
the suffix .txt.  In the case of a line coverage two files will be created: 
a lines file with the suffix .lin, and a label-text file with the suffix .txt.

For unlabelled polygon or line coverages, a single lines file, with .pol or .lin suffix, will be created.

See the DATA FILE FORMATS section below for more information about these files.

.SH EXAMPLE

The description of the Generate command in the SHAPE
Users Guide explains how to create coverages from files
containing line coordinates, such as prefix.lin and prefix.pol,
and files containing label-points, such as prefix.lab.  Following
is an example of the creation of a polygon coverage named soils
within SHAPE from files soils.pol and soils.lab:

.nf
   Arc: GENERATE SOILS 
   Generate: INPUT soils.pol
   Generate: LINES 
   Generating lines ...
   Generate: INPUT soils.lab
   Generate: POINTS
   Generating points ...
   Generate: QUIT
   Arc: _
.fi

This would create a polygon coverage named 'soils' with label-points. 
The label-points would have ID numbers that correspond to the GRASS
attribute values for the polygons in the coverage.  The INFO portion 
of SHAPE can be used to associate these label-point ID numbers 
with descriptive text from the soils.txt file.

.SH DATA FILE FORMATS
LINES FILE, also know as prefix.lin or prefix.pol file:
This text file is a Generate format lines file.  The lines option of the 
SHAPE Generate command can be used to read this file into SHAPE.  
Each line in the file has a unique line-ID number.

LABEL-POINTS FILE, also known as prefix.lab file:
This text file will be created by
.I v.out.shape
if the vector file being exported represents a polygon
coverage.  prefix.lab consists of a list of label-point coordinates (x,y), each
with a unique label-point ID number.

LABEL-TEXT FILE, also known as prefix.txt file:
In the case of a polygon coverage, this file associates an integer category number
and an attribute text string (with no spaces) with each label-point ID number.
In the case of a line coverage, this file associates an integer category number
and an attribute text string with each line-ID number.

The first column is the row number (which is arbitrary), the second column 
contains the category number, the third column is the line or label-point ID
number, and the fourth column is the attribute text string.
