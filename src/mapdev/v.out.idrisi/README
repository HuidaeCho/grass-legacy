v.out.idrisi

This is a quick and dirty export routine from GRASS to IDRISI. The
program exports binary GRASS vector files to ASCII IDRISI format. It
can be compiled like any other GRASS program under src.alpha by running
gmake4.1 and MAKELINKS afterwards. I haven't checked all the options
(especially if the version 3 export is OK and if there are more options
for the database units) but it should run fine in most situations. Any
comments or suggestions are welcome.
