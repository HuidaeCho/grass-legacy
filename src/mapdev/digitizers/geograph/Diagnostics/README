  To compile the diagnostics program for the geographics type 'make'.
  The diagnostics program will be called 'driver'.

  To start it up type 'driver /dev/tty??'.
  The /dev/tty?? is the tty the digitizer is connected to.


  If the digitizer can't be opened within 5 seconds it will come back and
  say so.  This means that the wrong tty?? name may have been given to the
  diagnostics program or the cabling between the computer and digitizer are
  incorrect.

  If the program is started and just sits there it could be a number of things:

	1)  the wrong /dev/tty?? was given to the program.
	2)  the digitizer isn't turned on.
	3)  the digitizer is on, but the cable between the digitizer and the
	    computer is incorrect.
	4)  the digitizer is on, but the box needs to be reset.
		(old type of serial box)
	5)  the RS232 cable fell off the back of the computer.
		(this happened)
	6)  there is a problem with the digitizer hardware.
	7)  last possibility, there is a bug in the program.
