Introduction
.PP
The Hitachi digitizer dip switch settings will be different depending on
which software is being ran at the time, GRASS or some other digitizing
package (AutoCad).  This means that the digitizer dip switch settings will
have to be changed every time a different digitizing software is used.
This paper contains the Hitachi digitizer switch settings for both GRASS
and AutoCad.  This paper also contains the cable configuration for the
cable that is used between the computer and the digitizer.
Fortunately, the cable that came with the digitizer can be used with GRASS.
This means that only one cable is needed to run GRASS on the SUN 386i and
the same cable can be used to run with the existing setup.
The digitizer driver is written for a Hitachi HDG series digitizer.

Hitachi Digitizer Switch Settings
.PP
There are two different sets of dip switch settings depending on if you
are going to use the digitizer for GRASS or AutoCad.
On the back of the Hitachi digitizer (with serial port) there are three
banks of eight dip switches.
The first bank of dip switches \fBDSW1\fR has all of the switches
down (off) for both GRASS and AutoCad.  The second bank of dip switches \fBDSW2\fR 
are the only set of switches that needs to be changed.  The switch settings
for \fBDSW2\fR are given in the sections below which relate to the software you
wish to run.  The third bank (\fBDSW3\fR) of dip switches have the dip switches 1-4
up (on) and 5-8 down (off).

Dip Switch Settings For GRASS

To run the digitizer with the GRASS software
set the switch settings as illustrated below.

Dip Switch Settings For AutoCad
.PP
The switch settings for AutoCad are given in the yellow handout that came
with the Hitachi, but
are listed here for completeness and for comparison between the
AutoCad settings and the GRASS settings.
To run the digitizer with the AutoCad software
set the switch settings for
the second bank (\fBDSW2\fR) of dip switches, as shown below.

Cabling for the Hitachi
.PP
The cabling between the digitizer and the computer that works for
both GRASS and AutoCad is listed below.
.br
For the computer (female) side:
.DS
2 and 3 are switched with 3 and 2 on the digitizer (male) side;
4 and 5 looped together;
6 and 20 looped together
7 straight through to 7 on the other side.
.DE

For the digitizer (male) side:
.DS
2 and 3 are switched with 3 and 2 on the
computer (female) side;
4, 5 and 8 looped together;
6 and 20 looped together;
and 7 straight through to 7 on the other side.
.DE
.sp
This was the cable that was already being used with the digitizer to run
AutoCad.  The SUN computer
did not need 4,5,6, or 20, but it made no difference to the SUN 386i if
the signals were there for the GRASS software.
.NH
Things To Check 
.PP
If the GRASS \fIdigit\fR program isn't working properly, make sure the tty
to which the digitizer is connected
has the getty off, the tty permissions set to 'crw-rw-rw', the 'digitcap' file
is correct for your system configuration, and the switch settings on the
digitizer are correct.  If none of the programs work, then
something is wrong with the cabling or the digitizer.
The digitizer can also be tested by using the diagnostic program that
came with the digitizer.  Read the file \fIREADME\fR in $GIS/src/mapdev/digitizers/hitachi.
