  These programs are used to test an ALTEK digitizer with AC-30 controller.
  They shouldn't be needed unless there are problems or you wish to expand the
  capabilities of this system and do your own testing.

  All the programs are compiled  'cc filename.c -o object.code.name' or to
  make/compile the berkley version of the test program type "make".  To make
  the AT&T version of the test program type 'make -f makeatt'.
  
  There is some programming documentation on reading and writing the digitizer
  in the files att_altek.c and  berk_altek.c .
  For more information on the digitizer commands read the file INSTALL in the
  directory above.



 Sun (Berkley universe)
	and
 Masscomp 3.1 (ucb universe):


	berk_altek.c  -  shows coordinates values being sent from digitizer.
		this is for digitizer output standard binary format 6 bytes.
		If the digitizer can't even be opened then none of the other programs
		will work.  It would mean that the cabling, the tty or the 
		digitizer is not setup properly.


	berk_stat.c  -   prints out informtion in hex format for debugging
		and writes it to a file 'diag_out' .


System V (att universe):

	att_altek.c  -  shows coordinates values being sent from digitizer.
		this is for digitizer output standard binary format 6 bytes.
		If the digitizer can't even be opened then none of the other programs
		will work.  It would mean that the cabling, the tty or the 
		digitizer is not setup properly.


	att_stat.c  -   prints out informtion in hex format for debugging
		and writes it to a file 'diag_out' .
