Patch, which enables user to choose one vector category 
to print from a vector file (Janne Soimasuo, Finnland)
   -> line_cat additions

files: do_vector.c, ps_vector.c
--------------------------
** added #include <stdlib.h> 7/98 Richard Nairn

--------------------------
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
    Did not plot grid and vecors correctly in lat-lon
    label location also didn't work in lat-lon
STATUS:
    FIXED and coming out with the next update

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
The manual for ps.map says that fields width and hwidth
specify the width of the line in pixels, which is not true:
they were actually interpreted as width in user space PostScript
coordinates: 1/72 of inch. I made the width double, added width options
for outline and grid, and also now the width ni is isnterpreted as n inches.
 
STATUS:
    FIXED and coming out with the next update

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Also in file outl_io.c o_write_line()  is an exact copy of the
write_ln() function in r.poly, which I fixed (GRASS930547) since
it was giving segmentation faults.

It looks like ps.map is doing exactly what r.poly does: creating
a vector file with boundaries of raster areas given a raster file.
Seems like a lot to do just to plot a map. If the user makes 10
different plots with the same raster file using outline, then 
every time exact same vector file is created and deleted.

Instead I want to draw little line segments between every pair of
differing cells without worrying too much about topology.
This will have one drawback: each vector line will be drawn as many
little line segments, each with beginning and the end, instead of
starting the PostScript path at each node and drawing a continuous line 
through all the points of vector line like it is done when drawing vector
maps.
Also I am going to add a line width parameter to outline command

FIXED BUGS:

  1. removed the G_strip(buf); instructions in function comment.c
     to allow leading and trailing spaces in comment file.

  2. removed statements:
     if (fontsize < 10) fontsize = 10;
     if (fontsize > 50) fontsize = 50;
     in function do_labels.c so as not to restrict the choice of font size.

  3. increased the maximum number of pixels allowed on a page in function
      map_setup.c : 
          limit = 300000000L; 
     if the total number of pixels is larger than "limit" then ps.map 
     reduces it to limit
     This change allows us to print layers at their actual resolution.
     For example: an AVHRR layer at 151 cells per inch. 

     NOTE: we are thinking about assigning different upper limits to different 
     Postscript devices, as an additional parameter in the ps.devices files.

  4. changed function plfile.c so that it accepts a line width of 0
     NOTE: it should also be changed to allow decimal point values.

(I already changed it to decimal number, and made it accept 0 .Olga)

  5. changed function ps_clrtbl.c so that category 0's label is read from the
     cats file rather than replaced by "no data"

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
background none in labels did not work, the box was black
The gridnumber size was set to zero if it was >50;
Also I want to add linewidth for grid

    FIXED and coming out with the next update
