.SH NAME
Gwindow \- window management program
.br
.I (G Language Tool)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Gwindow
is a command-line interface for setting/querying the current window.
The command format is:

Gwindow parms
.br
where parms are

.NF
n=x           set window north to x
s=x           set window south to x
e=x           set window east to x
w=x           set window west to x
res=x         set both north/south and east/west resolutions to x
ewres=x       set east/west resolution to x
nsres=x       set north/south resolution to x

window=name   set window from database window name
save=name     write current window to database window name
layer=name    set window from cell header for layer name
zoom=name     set window to smallest window containing data is layer name
default       set window from default window for the database

print         print the current window (to stdout)
gprint        print the current window (to stdout) in a format which
              can be given back to Gwindow on its command line

-             do not actually set the database window.
.FI

Any combination of parameters may be specified. They are applied in the
order specified. Missing parameters leave the current window values
unchanged.
.SH EXAMPLES
Gwindow n=7360100 e=699000

.RS
will reset the north and east for the current window, but leave the
south, west, and window resolutions unchanged.
.RE

Gwindow default s=698000 print

.RS
will set the current window from the default window for the database,
reset the south to 698000, and then print the result.
.RE

Gwindow n+=1000 w-=500

.RS
The n=x may also be specified n+=x to increase the current current north,
and n-=x to decrease it. This is also true for s=x, e=x, and w=x. In this case
the current window north is increased by 1000 and the current window west
is decreased by 500.
.RE

Gwindow n=s+1000 e=w+1000

.RS
This form sets the north to be 1000 larger than the south,
and the east 1000 larger than the west.
The corresponding forms s=n-x and w=e-x may be used for the south and the
west. 
.RE

Gwindow layer=soils

.RS
This form will set the current window to be exactly the same as the header
for the layer soils.
.RE

Gwindow layer=soils zoom=soils

.RS
This form will first look up the cell header for soils, use this as the
current window, and then shrink the window to the samllest window which
contains all the data in the layer soils. Note that if the parameter
layer=soils were not specifed, the zoom would begin with the current window.
.RE

Gwindow - layer=soils print

.RS
The - option supresses the setting of the database window. This can be useful
when it is desired to only extract window information. In this case,
the cell header for the soils file is printed without changing the
current window.
.RE

Gwindow - layer=soils zoom=soils save=soils
.RS
This will zoom into the smallest window which contains all the soils data
and save it in the database window named soils. The current window is
not changed.
.RE
.SH NOTE
After all updates have been applied, the current window south and the west 
are (silently) adjusted so that the north/south distance is a multiple
of the north/south resolution and that the east/west distance is a multiple
of the east/west resolution.

The print option prints the current window in the format:

.in +5
.NF
projection: 1 (UTM)
zone:       15
north:       4294050.00
south:       4249950.00
east:         526050.00
west:         500950.00
nsres:           100.00
ewres:           100.00
rows:      441
cols:      251
.FI
.in

The gprint option prints the window in the following format:

.in +5
.NF
n=4294050.00
s=4249950.00
e=526050.00
w=500950.00
nsres=100.00
ewres=100.00
.FI
.in

This format does not have the rows and columns, but can be given back to
Gwindow on its command line.

The print (or gprint) option is recognized last. This means that all changes
are applied to the window before printing occurs.
