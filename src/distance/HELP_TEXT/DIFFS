to_cell - from_cell differences

GRASS employs two different methods for generating proximity (distance-from)
maps.  You choose the method based on its complexity and your growing
experience.  The two methods should give equivalent results.

Complex "salt and pepper" maps are processed very fast with the to_cell method.

Maps with only a few points (likes wells or archeology sites) run very quickly
with the from_cell algorithm.

Maps of intermediate complexity like a few roads or streams, a border, or
a couple of areas may run equally well with either method.

Note:  These two methods create slightly different results
