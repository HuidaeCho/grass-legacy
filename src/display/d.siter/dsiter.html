          <em>d.siter</em> - Interactively displays subsets of a sites list
          based on site attributes

     DESCRIPTION

          d.siter is a script which calls s.info to determine the
          number, types and ranges of site attributes, then calls a
          tcl script which presents a user interface.  On the
          interface there are two sliders for each dimension,
          category, or decimal attribute in the sites file.  If a
          header with labels is in the file, the sliders will be
          labeled.  The value range for each slider pair is determined
          by the range for the corresponding attribute found in the
          sites file for sites within the current region.  At startup
          one slider in each pair is set at the minimum value and the
          other slider is set at the maximum value.  The user adjusts
          sliders as needed to set ranges of desired values for each
          attribute, dimension, or category.  The interface also has
          controls for setting the size, color, and type of marker,
          and buttons for <strong>display</strong>, <strong>erase</strong>, <strong>reset scales</strong>, and <strong>quit</strong>.
          When the <strong>display</strong> button is chosen, the GRASS program
          <A HREF="dsites_qual.html">d.sites.qual</A> is called with rules derived from the current
          state of the interface and the specified subset is drawn in
          the active GRASS monitor.  By adjusting the size, color and
          type of marker and drawing multiple subsets, the user may
          more easily visualize spatial relationships of various
          subsets or determine inconsistant attribute values.  Subsets
          may be saved by entering a filename in the text entry box of
          the interface and choosing <strong>save as:</strong>.

          Due to the limited resolution of sliders and considering the
          wide range and distribution often found in site attribute
          data, a <strong>rescale</strong> button is provided.  Choosing <strong>rescale</strong>
          results in the currently defined ranges becoming the new min
          and max and the sliders being reset to their left and right
          extremes, allowing further refinement of the range.  To undo
          the <strong>rescale</strong> operation, the user may select <strong>reset scales</strong>
          which resets all scales to their startup values (loosing any
          ranges already specified).

          This program can be run non-interactively or interactively.
          If the user gives the name of a GRASS site_lists map on the
          command line the program will be run non-interactively.
          Alternately, the user can type simply d.siter on the command
          line; in this case, the program will prompt the user for a
          site_lists map.

     BUGS
          Due to pixel rounding, startup ranges for sliders may be
          slightly off for floating point attributes.  The slider min
          value will be slightly lower than the min value found in the
          file and the slider max value will be slightly higher.
