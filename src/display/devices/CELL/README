                                  CELL driver

  This display driver is to allow the output of ANY GRASS display commands
to end up back in a GRASS raster file.  This file can then be treated
like any other raster file, and displayed or exported to an image processing
system.
    The one unique funtion that this provides is to allow the output of
d.3d to be placed into file at any resolution.  Currently the only method
we have had is to use the X0 etc. driver and do a screendump to capture
it at the resolution of the screen.
    Other than that, anything that you can put on the screen can now be
placed into a cell file (including p.map output).

    Note that commands that require the MOUSE will NOT work correctly (or
at all)

    
Use it like any other display driver:
    0. GRASS_WIDTH=xxx   #if you want another size than the default 640
       export GRASS_WIDTH
       GRASS_HEIGHT=xxx  #if you want another size than the default 480
       export GRASS_WIDTH

    1. Use 
         d.mon start=CELL
         d.mon select=CELL  
       to start it up.  

    2. (the display command)

    3. When done displaying stuff to CELL driver, use
         d.mon stop=CELL     
This will write the file. A new cell file called  D_cell will be created  
then in your current mapset.  It will have its own window independent of 
(and incompatible with) the location.

    Some machines can be real slow initializing the output file, so
wait until you see the   'READY'  from d.mon start=CELL before trying
to select it.

Display such CELL file like this:
       d.mon x0   (if already started, use select option)
       g.region raster=D_cell
       d.erase
       d.rast D_cell
       g.region -d
       d.erase

Export such raster file like this:
       g.region raster=D_cell
       r.out.tga input=D_cell output=grasscell.tga  (or your favorite export
                                                     module)       
       g.region -d
