  This display driver is to allow the output of ANY GRASS display commands
to end up back in a GRASS raster file.  This file can then be treated
like any other raster file, and displayed or exported to an image processing
system.
    The one unique funtion that this provides is to allow the output of
D3d to be placed into file at any resolution.  Currently the only method
we have had is to use the SUNVIEW driver and do a screendump to capture
it at the resolution of the screen.
    Other than that, anything that you can put on the screen can now be
placed into a cell file (including Pmap output).

    Note that commands that require the MOUSE will NOT work correctly (or
at all)

    
    Use it like any other display driver   Use  d.mon start=CELL
and d.mon select=CELL  to start it up.  Then when done displaying 
stuff to it, use   d.mon stop=CELL     a new cell file called  D_cell
will then be created in your current mapset.  It will have its own
window independant of (and incompatible with) the location.

    Some machines can be real slow initializing the output file, so
wait until you see the   'READY'  from d.mon start=CELL before trying
to select it.
