Markus,

XDRIVER is now actually XDRIVER_24 and the libes are done.


This directory contains the source code for  the  GRASS  graphics
drivers.  In  most  cases  the  drivers merely translates generic
GRASS graphics calls into calls understood by local  hardware  or
software.

Contents:
   README        this file you are reading now
   Gmakefile     GRASS makefile which drives the compilation
   lib           Code which provides the main body of the drivers
   GENERIC       Documentation describing device dependent code in any driver
   MASS          The MASSCOMP driver
   SUN           The SUN color driver for SUN windows
   4105          For Tektronix 4105
   CELL          For creating images in a GRASS raster file
   IGRAPH        Intergraph driver
   IRIS          IRIS Personal Workstation - Silicon Graphics
   XDRIVER       X-windows driver
   monitorcap    generic monitorcap file installed in $GISBASE/etc

To install a driver on your system, simply run the gmake  command
on  that directory (after you have run GISGEN to build the entire
system).

After you have compiled the driver, you will need to  tell  GRASS
about  it.  To  do  this,  edit the $GISBASE/etc/monitorcap file
and add the driver to this file.
