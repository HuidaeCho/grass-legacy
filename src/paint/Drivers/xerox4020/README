================================================================
Dip switches will need to set to suit your particular system.

We have been using a serial (RS232) version of the printer at 9600
baud, and have had good results on an SGI IRIS (under GRASS 3.0, 3.1
and 4.0) and on a PC386 running DBA's GRASS/X86 3.1+ (without changing
our dip switches)

This driver compiled and installed without any drama on both systems.

To compile the driver add paint/Drivers/xerox4020 to your list.local
(or run gmake4.0 in the directory)

We understand that the XEROX 4020 is now only available with a parallel
port and for this version a parallel to serial converter will be
necessary.

As at the date of writing we have not tried to set this version of the
printer on a system running GRASS.

The driver does not utilise the full width of printing available (it is
capable of 1088 dots per line in graphics mode) but I suspect that this
is controlled in the Paint Interface software. One Of These Days we
will see if we can get a little more out of it.

The printer has been extremely reliable. (No problems whatsoever in
over 3 yrs of continual use ) and gives very good color.

Note that ink and paper supplies can be procured from Tektronix (uses
the same consumables as the 4696.

Tektronix part numbers are as follows:

cyan ink package .....016-0840-01
yellow ink package....016-0842-01
magenta ink package...016-0841-01
black ink package.....016-0839-01

11 inch wide roll paper ...016-0920-00
