These are all variations on the basic driver. The driver 
only produces a sun rasterfile and then calls the versatek program
"sprint" to print the rasterfile. There are many options to "sprint".
These variations can only be invoked by changing the driver script,
which is what you find in this directory - various attempts by users at
CERL to get the colors they wanteed from the "sprint" utility.
