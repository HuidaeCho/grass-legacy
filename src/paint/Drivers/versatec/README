The driver executable lives in driver/ and the shell script(s) live in
their own directory. The driver/ hopefully will be the same for all
versatec eloctrostatic plotters, since it just produces a rasterfile in
a format which the versatec rgb utility knows how to plot. The rgb
utility (i.e, the sprint command), has the -p <model> option to tell it
what knid of printer it is send output to. The shell script(s) will
tell the driver how to run the sprint command.

To compile one driver, e.g. the 3236,
add two lines to the GRASS list of programs to
compile
  paint/Drivers/versatec/driver
  paint/Drivers/versatec/3236
The first compiles the driver, the second installs the shell script for
the printer (which sets some environment variables and then runs the
driver).

However, you will have to edit the driver shell script in the 3236
directory before compiling. See the README in paint/Drivers/versatek/3236

The driver will produce a sun rasterfile format (same format as
produced by the sun screendump command) since it is understood by the
sprint utility and is the most compact format recognized by the sprint
command.

The sprint utility understand sun's standard raster format, but not
the byte-encoded format.

Notes.
 When we first got the 3236e (with embedded raster controller), the
 117a interface board was installed in the sun machine with switches
 set to the test positions. The versatec print.file and plot.file test
 plots worked, but sprint <screendump-file> failed. FLipping the
 switches to the correct positions was the right thing to do, but
 caused UNix to think the 117a board was offline. We has to power the
 baord (ie. the machine) down and up to get it back online.

 The embedded raster controller, which converts vector data to raster
 format, works fine with raster data as output by the sprint utility.
 This means both vector and raster output is possible with the
 controller in place.
