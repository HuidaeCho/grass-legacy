p.map.new : 
 
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
1.  the "textsize" parameter for
    the "grid" instruction is renamed to "numbersize" (for consistency).
STATUS:
    FIXED with update package 1
		
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
2.  Fixed the following problem:
    p.map.new used to first draw all the objects: barscale, grid, legend,...
    and remember their labels.
    and only afterwards draw all the labels together.
    Obviously when the objects overlapped, it was a problem.
STATUS:
    FIXED with update package 1

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
3.  opaque n[no] doesn't work.
STATUS:
    is on the list of things to be fixed

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
4.  sometimes didn't paint the text labels.
STATUS:
    FIXED with update package 3

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
5.  p.map.new didn't check if the text is really provided. It read it into a 
    char string and doesn't check if it's NULL before using it. 
STATUS:
    FIXED  and coming out with next update

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
6.  p.map.new sometimes gave segmentation faults when doing legends. 
STATUS:
    FIXED  and coming out with next update

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
A barscale option of p.map.new did not work for any locations with resolution
in different units (other than meters).
This was because the intervals of the bar were just added to eastings
to draw the bar, i.e. to draw a bar of 1 km, p.map.new used
to call G_plot_line(e, n, e + 1000).
STATUS:
    FIXED  and coming out with next update

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
As reported by Scott Wade if 2 or more legennds are plotted,
all the legends have the same category numbers and descriptions
as the first legend, all the other parameters of legends are different.
This was because variables nocat, nosite, novect in legentable.c weren't
static and were initialized to 0 with each call, which is wrong.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
The legends which looked fine in preview and preview2, were messed up on
a plot: all the labels were moved to the top of the box partially
overlapping and the bottom half of the box was empty.
also the boxheight was not computed correctly based on number of sites, 
with more than 2 sites it was too short.
and boxheight was not computed correctly if there are >1 vector in legend
and textsize is small, the box then wass too long.

NOTE: to fully fix this problem, go to /src/libes/gis/plot.c
edit line #83:  (xconv should be yconv).
Then recompile gis library by running gmake4.1
then go back to p.map.new directory and run gmake4.1 there

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: (GRID)
    When drawing a solid line grid of us map in latlon, the horizontal
    lines are drawn only partially.
    also ticks smaller than 25 pixels weren't drawn for this map.
    The reason is that the tick size in pixels
    is converted to geogr. resolution for plotting,
    and this resolution is then conv. to integer. Since it can easily
    be less than 1 degree in lat-lon, the resolution is then 0, so
    no ticks are drawn.
