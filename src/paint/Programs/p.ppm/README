This program  (paint.ppm) reads portable pixmap (ppm) files.
These file formats are created by the PPM utilities by Jef Poskanzer.

Limitations
    This program only supports the binary format (P6)

    Maximum color level is 255. If the ppm file has more colors
    levels, use ppmcscale to reduce the number of colors.

    No scaling is done. Use ppmscale to change image size.

    No rotation is done. Use ppmrotate to rotate the image

If the image doesn't fit the output device, it won't get printed.
If you want it printed (but clipped) use the -f option to this paint.ppm
or scale the input using ppmscale or rotate the image using ppmrotate
(if it will fit that way -- otherwise you might have to scale it as well).
If the image doesn't fit, paint.ppm will tell you what scale value to give
to ppmscale that will make it fit.

For suntools,
   sleep 10; screendump | rasttoppm | ppmrotate 90 | paint.ppm

  The sleep allows you time to arrange the windows before the screen dump starts
  The ppmrotate is usually needed since the sun screens are wide than they are
  long (and wider than 1024 pixels - which is the width of most of our printers)


For X
   xwd | xwdtoppm | ppmrotate 90 | paint.ppm
