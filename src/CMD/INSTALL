Information:

The GRASS code compiling is managed by the "auto-conf"
tool now. Please read the instructions in the main
source code directory.

The code cannot be compiled directly from the "GISGEN.sh"
script any more due to the change to "auto-conf".

Use /usr/local/bin/gmake5 and
    /usr/local/bin/gmakelinks5
tp compile single modules.
