.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dcoloroff 
sets the offset into the graphic device's color lookup table which will be used
for color number one (1).  This offset number is also saved as part of the
current graphic window's description.   This is useful (and only applicable)
when using the 
.B float
option of the
Dcolormode
command.  It allows several different windows to
occupy the screen without using each other's colors.

used in the screen's windows.
