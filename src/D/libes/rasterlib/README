This directory contains the graphics library that is compiled into
GRASS graphics tools and programs.  At runtime GRASS programs, through
this library, connect themselves to a graphics driver.   This connection
is made through fifo (first-in-first-out) files on BELL Unix systems (e.g. 
MASSCOMP and ATT 3B2), and through INET sockets on Berkley machines (eg. SUN).
The OS flag (set in src/CMD/makehead) is set to BERK or SYSV (System five).


If you are running a version of Unix which supports fifo files do the
following:

fifo files are used for GRASS application program - GRASS graphics driver
communication.  One drawback from the Berkley socket version is that both
programs must run on the same machine.  Edit the io.c file and find the
following two lines:  (they will not be together)
    _wfd = open("/dev/fifo.a", WRITE) ;
    _rfd = open("/dev/fifo.b", READ) ;
You may choose to leave these lines alone (suggested), in which case you will
need to create these two files (as root):
    login root
    cd /dev
    mknod fifo.a p
    mknod fifo.b p
    chmod 0666 fifo.a fofo.b
    exit
If you choose to change these, you must create the corresponding files as
just described and you must make corresponding changes in the file
.../gis/src/D/devices/SWITCHER.c .   This switcher routine is the main routine
for the graphics driver which communicates with this library.  Read the README
file in that directory.

Note that GRASS is released to use /dev/fifo.a and /dev/fifo.b as is.  No
editing is necessary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are running a BERKLEY Unix which does not support FIFO files or
you wish to run the graphics driver on a different machine than the 
GRASS application programs do the following:

In the file io.c find a line that looks something like this the following. It
should be in a routine called socketto:
	char 			*host = "illinois", *service = "sunmonitor";
The variable "host" must be set to the name of the machine on which the 
graphics driver program is running.  Internet sockets are used and will allow
the GRASS application program to run on a machine different from the driver
program.  That machine name however must be assigned to "host".   An alternate
version would set host to some environment variable.
