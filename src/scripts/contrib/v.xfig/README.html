Map creation:<p>

Vector/raster maps can be easily draw with 
 <A HREF="http://www-epb.lbl.gov/xfig/"> xfig</A>, a freeware drawing 
program for X-Windows environment. 
Xfig allows saving the maps in image formats or Postscript.
Luckily it can handle BIG raster maps. You can define the paper size and
the current version offers a "scale window" to tell you the <b>line lengths in
ground coordinates</b> (e.g. line length in meters) while drawing. This is very
helpful for creating the coordinate system map borders and for measurement.<br>
The following conversion scripts were written by <A HREF=mailto:bouchard@onera.fr>Jacques Bouchard</a>:<p>
 <ul>
  <li> Import <b>GRASS raster maps</b> into xfig: GRASS raster maps can be 
        imported into xfig in GIF-format 
        (convert with "xv" or "netpbm"-tools before). For 3D-high resolution
        output we recommend the <A HREF=admin/d.3d_CELL.html>CELL driver</a>
        (when you want to make prints of <A
        HREF=gdp/html_421/html/d.3d.html>d.3d</a>).
  <li> <b>GRASS vector maps</b> have to be converted by following script to the 
        xfig-format (use inside GRASS):
  <ul>
  <li> Import GRASS vector maps into xfig: Export your GRASS binary vector map 
       to GRASS ascii vector 
       map with <A HREF=gdp/html_421/html/v.out.ascii.html>v.out.ascii</a>, get 
       the file from
       $LOCATION/dig_ascii and  convert it to 
       xfig format with:  <A HREF=related/fig/grass2fig>grass2fig</a> (26.1.99).
        You may configure the script for your convenience (see configuration
        part within the script).
  <li> Export xfig vector maps to GRASS: Convert the xfig map to GRASS ASCII 
       vector format with
       <A HREF=related/fig/fig2grass>fig2grass</a> (26.1.99), store it in 
        $LOCATION/dig_ascii and use 
        <A HREF=gdp/html_421/html/v.in.ascii.html>v.in.ascii</a> to import it 
        into GRASS.
       You may configure the script for your convenience (see configuration
        part within the script).
