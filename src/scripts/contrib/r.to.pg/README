# r.to.pg:
# exports GRASS raster map to PostgreSQL database
# supports only one value, no attribute cats
#
# Bug fixed: rastermap name will be used if celltable is not set.
#	     '==' should be changed to '='.
#	     PG_DBASE is used instead of DB_DATABASE in case g.select.pg used.

# BUG: celltable needs to be exchanged to user's wish. But how
#      to tell "awk" about it?
#      Problem is to use environment variables within "awk".
