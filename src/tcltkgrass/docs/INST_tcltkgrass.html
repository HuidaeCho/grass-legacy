Welcome to TCLTKGRASS                   5. March 1999

This text describes how to install TCLTKGRASS, if
you have already installed the TCL/TK-libraries 8.0 on
your system. For installing these libraries, please
read INST_tcl_libs.txt


Requirements:
  - GRASS 4.x (4.1 as well as 4.2.1)
  - GRASS 5.x
  - Tcl/Tk 8.0 libraries for your unix platforms
  - five minutes of your time
    

A. Check your existing TCL-TK libraries
   
   The "wish" program must be available (in path):
       which wish8.0
   The file wish8.0 may be in in the 
   <directory> either /usr/local/bin or /usr/X11/bin etc.

   The name must be: wish8.0   (wish4.2 cannot be used! It is too old!)
   

B. Install TCLTKGRASS

 - TCLTKGRASS can be unpacked anywhere, for example:

     cd /usr/local/grass42/
     gunzip < tcltkgrass_2.6.tar.gz | tar xvf -

   That will create the directory "tcltkgrass".
   If one was already there, please remove it before.

 - run the GRASS shell

 - type "make" to generate the tcltkgrass run script ($GISBASE/bin/tcltkgrass)


C. Run TCLTKGRASS

 - Start TCLTKGRASS from the GRASS shell with 

     tcltkgrass &

Have fun!
