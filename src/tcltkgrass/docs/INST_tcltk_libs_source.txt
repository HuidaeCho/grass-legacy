      -------------------------------------------------
        This text describes the installation of the 
       required TCL/TK 8.0 libraries, if you get them
                      in !! SOURCE !! code.
      -------------------------------------------------

   The graphical user interface "TCLTKGRASS" needs some library 
   files etc. for creating buttons and menus. These libraries 
   are required, their name is  "Tcl/Tk 8.0 library". These files 
   are stored in Internet (http://sunscript.sun.com/TclTkCore/8.0.html).
   Get the source code from the UNIX section there, it is
   platform independent.


A. Compiling of the Tcl/TK 8.0 libraries 

   Log in as "root".
   
   Create an empty directory somewhere and unpack both 
   tcl8.0.tar.gz and
   tk8.0.tar.gz there:

       gunzip tcl8.0.tar.gz
       gunzip tk8.0.tar.gz
       tar xvf tcl8.0.tar.gz
       tar xvf tk8.0.tar.gz

   Now configure and compile the packages. The optional 
   parameter "--enable-gcc" is only required, when using gcc
   (for example, when "configure --enable-shared" fails, while
   using cc-compiler). 
   
       cd tcl8.0/unix
       configure --enable-shared [--enable-gcc]
       make
       make install

       cd ../..
       cd tk8.0/unix
       configure --enable-shared [--enable-gcc]
       make
       make install

  Usually you should not have problems, we have tested it on SUN
  Solaris 2.6/2.6 and Linux platforms successfully.
   
  Now the TCL/TK 8.0 libraries are installed.


B. Installation of  TCLTKGRASS

   -> Read INST_tcltkgrass.txt for details.
