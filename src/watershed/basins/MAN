catch

.SH DESCRIPTION
Catch
generates an output layer containing a unique category number
and area for each subbasin within a given watershed and for
a given stream network.  This is meant to be run as part of
the watershed software series, and needs an input map layer
of corrected drainage directions (from "river") and the name
of the thinned stream network, for which the nodes file
(from "clcode") will be obtained.  Output basins are numbered 
according to the needs of input for the MULTSED modelling
system.
.SH NOTES
Output from catch may be a supercell file,
depending on the number of channel segments
in the stream network.
The current window setting is ignored.  Instead,
the window of the stream network input map layer
is used.
