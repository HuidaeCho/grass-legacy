.SH DESCRIPTION
Clcode
generates a coded stream network given a binary input layer
which is a one pixel width stream network.  At each branching
of the original network, a new category number is assigned.
Thus, the resulting network has each channel segment denoted by
a unique category number.  A file is also created which contains
the nodes (beginning and ending points) for each segment, as
well as the length of each segment.  Channel segments are
numbered according to their necessary input order into the
MULTSED modelling system.  A user who wishes only
to have the nodes file as input for the next program in the
watershed software series ("catch") has the option of not
requesting cell output of the coded stream netowrk.
.SH NOTES
Clcode expects binary input.  However, the output map
layer (if requested) may be a supercell file if more
than 255 channel segments are found.
The current window setting is ignored.  Instead,
the window of the input map layer is used.
