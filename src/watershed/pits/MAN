.SH DESCRIPTION
Pits
generates a list of pit points designated by their
easting and northing coordinates.
Pits are points which are characterized by
having a lower elevation value than all points surrounding
them.  Input to this program should be a cell file containing
true elevation values, although it is sometimes helpful to
filter the elevation file first  (see "filtermap").  In the
filtering process, the number of pits is usually decreased
significantly, eliminating many pits which are glitches in
data instead of true pits.
The pit points are sorted by decreasing elevation value, and
stored in a file under the current mapset.
.SH NOTES
pits works properly with supercell layers.
The current window setting is ignored.  Instead,
the window of the input (elevation) map layer is used.
