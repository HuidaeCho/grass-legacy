 GRASS DATA

.S 3

  GRASS data originates from three
  distinct sources.

  The most common is hardcopy  maps.
.C yellow
    For example: landuse

  The second common source is image data.
.C yellow
    This could be satellite or high
    altitude photography.

  The last most common source is other
  computers.
.C yellow
    This could mean a complete data base
    from another machine, or a special
    map like: elevation.

  A final type of data is "interpreted
  data".  This is information which is
  based on one or more of the above
  sources.
.C yellow
    For example, from elevation we can
    interpret slope percent and aspect
    (direction of slope.)

How to get data into GRASS
.C white
.S 3

  Data is brought into GRASS through:

  * Hand digitizing using a cursor on
    a drafting table.

  * Hand digitizing using an image on
    the screen

  * Reading data on computer tape from
    another GIS.

  * Manipulation of existing data

Themes and Categories
.C white
.S 3

  GRASS data bases consist of maps.
  Each map contains a different theme.
  Each theme is characterized by a set
  of "categories". E.g.:

.C yellow
  Map theme        Categories
.C white
   landuse          roads
                    buildings
                    park
   vegetation       none
                    trees
                    grass
   etc.

   Each category in a given map is
   displayed with a distinct color.
.C yellow

   For example, a landuse map with
   its categories displayed.
