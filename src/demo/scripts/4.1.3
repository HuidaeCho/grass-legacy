  Analyses using mathematical equations are
  very useful.  Such analyses treat the
  category values of a map as real values
  however.  (This is not the case with the
  weighted overlays and boolean operations).

  You can enter meaningful expressions like:
.C yellow
    newmap = elevation / 2
    erosion = slope * soils.texture
.C white

  If you use maps which contain nominal
  data your mathematical results will be
  nonsense:
.C yellow
    newmap = geology * soils / landuse
.C white
  Though these maps are encoded with numbers,
  the numbers are simply shorthand for a
  long text description.
