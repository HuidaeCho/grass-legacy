Any and all changes should be made to the man? files not the cat? files.
(Except if a man? file is removed, you will have to remove the corresponding
cat? file by hand).

If you add a new manual or help entry or modify one, type

	gmake

If you remove a man? entry, be sure to remove the corresponding cat?
entry and the /usr/grass3/man/? (or /usr/grass3/help) entry as well.

To find out how well the manual entries correspond to the commands in the
bin directory, run the command

	missing


To peruse an entry on-line, type:
	tbl.nroff man1/<entry> | more
	tbl.nroff man2/<entry> | more
	etc.
To send it to the imagen (at CERL only):
	imagen man1/<entry>
	etc.
