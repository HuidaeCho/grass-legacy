NAME
     v.transform - Transforms a vector map from one coordinate
     system to another coordinate system.
     (Map Development Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     v.transform
     or
     v.transform mapin=name mapout=name coord=name
     [verbose=(yes,no)]

DESCRIPTION
     The program can be run interactively or with command line
     arguments.  It will prompt the user for any inputs not
     provided on the the command line, except for the verbose
     option.  When the program is run interactively, it will ask
     for the input map and an output map name.  It will then ask
     for two sets of transformation points.

     The first set of points is in the coordinate system of the
     input map; the second set of points represents the
     corresponding geographic points in the coordinate system
     into which the map will transformed.  A user must enter 4 to
     10 of each set of points for the transformation to work
     correctly.

     After the user has entered both sets of points, the program
     will show the amount of error associated with the
     transformation of the given points as the residual mean
     average (RMS).  (An acceptable RMS for a 1:24,000 UTM map
     would be 1.2 to 2.4 (meters).) It will then ask if the
     transformation RMS value is acceptable.  After an RMS is
     accepted by the user, v.transform will transform the ascii
     (dig_ascii) vector map and its associated attribute
     (dig_att) file into the requested coordinate system.
     Remember to run support.vect or import.to.vect on the output
     map.

     We have used this program to import vector files that were
     in scanner or digitizer (x,y) coordinates and to transform
     these into UTM coordinates.  It is a way of rectifying
     vector maps.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     Four command line arguments can be used with v.transform :

____________________________________________________________________________________________________
 [mapin=name]         Name of the existing ascii (dig_ascii) map to be transformed.
 [mapout=name]        Name of the ascii map to be created (result of the transformation).
 [coord=name]         Name of the file holding the input and output transformation coordinates.
                      Give a full path name for this file or the current directory will be assumed.

|    When rectifying a map to another coordinate system using                                      |
|    v.transform, the user should specify the coordinates of                                       |
|    between 4 to 10 points, and state these both in the                                           |
|    coordinate systems of the input and output maps.  The two                                     |
|    sets of coordinates can be input to v.transform                                               |
|    interactively, or from a file specified on the command line                                   |
|    with the coord option.  The coord option is especially                                        |
|    useful when several maps in the same geographic area require                                  |
|    transformation, as it eliminates the necessity for the user                                   |
|    to repeatedly type in the same transformation coordinates.                                    |
|                                                                                                  |
|    A coord file will contain between 4 to 10 lines; each line                                    |
|    will contain the set of coordinate transformation points for                                  |
|    the input map and the corresponding set of coordinates for                                    |
|    the output map.  The minimum number of lines for the                                          |
|    transformation to take place is four.                                                         |

     The format of the coord file is shown below:

                       ________________________
                      | Input Map   Output Map|
                      |_______________________|
                      | x       y   x        y|
                      | x       y   x        y|
                      | x       y   x        y|
                      | x       y   x        y|
                      |_______________________|

     In the format above the x's and y's can be thought of as
     eastings and northings, depending on what coordinate systems
     you are transforming to and from.

     An example of the coord file:

                  __________________________________
                 | 1       1       589000   4913000|
                 | 1       17000   589000   4930000|
                 | 17000   17000   610000   4930000|
                 | 17000   1       610000   4913000|
                 |_________________________________|

     Within the coord file, numbers on a line must be spaced
     apart with tabs or blanks.  The example shown above was used
     to convert a map in digitizer coordinates (range of 1-18000)
     to UTM coordinates within the UTM zone for the Spearfish
     database location.  Because this coord file is not your
     usual GRASS data file, the user will have to keep track of
     where it is on the system.  When the coord option is used on
     the command line to input the transformation points, the
     program does not ask if everything is acceptable before
     converting the vector file and the attribute file.

     The verbose option is used to specify whether program
     messages will be written to the screen.  Its default is yes
     if unspecified on the command line.

NOTES
     It is advisable to run this program interactively with a
     specific set of transformation coordinates and to look at
     the resulting residuals, to determine how accurate the
     transformation will be (ie., pick points with known values
     in both coordinate systems).  After the residuals are
     acceptable, those transformation coordinates can be used
     with the program non-interactively to transform other maps
     in the same geographic area.

WARNING
     This is a general purpose program and can be fooled into
     giving low residuals.  It is strongly suggested that any

     transformed map be checked for accuracy.  The program
     assumes that the coordinate systems will be planimetric and
     has never been tested with negative values.

     If this program is being used to transform maps from State
     Plane to UTM and vice versa there are couple of things to be
     aware of.  This program will work better with State Plane
     zones that use the Transverse Mercator projection.  Those
     are states that have their state zones splitting the state
     vertically, like Illinois.  This program will not work as
     well with states that use the Lambert Conformal Conic
     projection.  Those are states that have their state zones
     splitting the state horizontally, like Wisconsin.  It is
     also best to keep the area being transformed small.
