NAME
     Gpoly - Extract areas from cell file into digit file
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gpoly cell_file digit_file

DESCRIPTION
     Gpoly scans the named cell_file and extracts lines which
     will separate it into areas.

     Gpoly will create a vector data file from a given cell file.
     It will outline each unique area in the cell file and create
     vector data to represent it.  The cell values will be used
     to create attribute information for the resultant vector
     areas.


NOTES
     Gpoly extracts areas only.

     You will need to run support.vect on the resultant files to
     build the dig_plus information.
