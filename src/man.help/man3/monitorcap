.SH NAME
monitorcap \- Device driver database file format
.SH DESCRIPTION
The commands
.IR monitor ,
.IR Dlist.mon ,
.IR Dselect.mon ,
.IR Drelease.mon ,
.IR Dstart.mon ,
.IR Dstatus.mon ,
.IR Dstop.mon ,
.IR Dwhich.mon
and all graphics commands
access a device driver database stored in the file $GISBASE/etc/monitorcap.
This file contains a line for each graphics monitor on the system.
Each line contains 6 fields separated by colons:
.sp
.IP name 8
the name by which the user identifies the driver
.IP program
the full pathname of the executable driver
or
a pathname relative to $GISBASE
.IP description
A sort 4 or 5 word description of the driver.
.IP fifos
full pathnames to the input and output fifos over which
the driver communicates with the libraries
.IP tty
the name of the tty from which the driver must be
started, or empty if there is no such restriction
.IP msg
a message to print to the user if an attempt is made to
start the driver from the wrong tty.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following is an example of a single monitor system. The driver may
be started from any terminal and uses /dev/fifo.a and /dev/fifo.b for
communication with application programs:

.nf
x:driver/X:graphics monitor:/dev/fifo.a /dev/fifo.b::any terminal
.fi

This example has 2 monitor on the system, using the same device driver.
Note that each has a different
.I name
field and uses a different pair of fifos. Also, each must be started on
a specific terminal:

.nf
1:driver/X:monitor 1:/dev/fifo.1a /dev/fifo.1b:/dev/tty8:tty8
2:driver/X:monitor 2:/dev/fifo.2a /dev/fifo.2b:/dev/tty10:tty10
.fi
.SH NOTES
Each line in this file must refer to a valid driver. No comment
lines are supported. Also no blank lines are allowed.
