.SH NAME
paint \- Hardcopy color output system.
.SH INTRODUCTION
The
.B paint
system allows the user to produce color hardcopy maps of vector and cell
file data at any scale. For a discussion of the
.B paint
functions, see the manual entries
.I paint[1],\ Pmap[2],
and
.I Pselect[2].
.SH PAINT DEVICES
.B Paint
supports multiple color printers using a 
.I device\ driver
concept. The user programs
(paint, Pmap, etc) send graphics requests to device dependent
paint drivers. These drivers translate the application requests into
device dependent requests to produce the maps.
.SH INSTALLING A PAINT DRIVER
A number of
.B paint
drivers have been distributed with GRASS. The installation
of a driver is a 2 step process.
The first is indentifying the
driver(s) which correspond to the printer(s) on your system
and compiling those drivers. The second is telling each driver
which i\*/o port it is to use.

.IP 1 3
The source code for the drivers lives in $GISBASE\*/paint\*/Drivers
(GISBASE refers to the directory where GRASS is installed).

The selection and compilation of the drivers is done when GRASS
is compiled as a whole.
.IP 2
The port configuration is handled using the Unix 
.I ln
command. 

Each driver expects to send its output to \*/dev\*/\fIdriver\fR.
For example, the 
.B tek4695
driver expects to find a tektronix 4695 (or 4696) printer on
\*/dev\*/tek4695.

Suppose the printer is actually on \*/dev\*/tty10. Then a link named \*/dev\*/tek4695
is made to \*/dev\*/tty10:

.ti 15
ln\ \*/dev\*/tty10\ \*/dev\*/tek4695
.SH NOTES
There are 2 drivers which do not use i\*/o ports.
One is the
.B preview
driver which sends its output to the graphics screen instead of a hardcopy
printer. This driver is very handy and should definitely
be compiled on your system.

The other is the
.B null
driver which is for debugging purposes and probably should not be compiled
on your system.

If you compile either of these drivers, you shouldn't create a \*/dev file for
them.
