.SH "EXTRACTING IMAGERY DATA INTO A GRASS DATABASE"
Remotely sensed images are captured for computer processing
by filtering radiation emanating from the image into
various electromagnetic wavelength bands, converting the
overall intensity for each band to digital
format, and storing the values on computer compatible
media such as magnetic tape.

The GRASS programs which extract image data from magnetic tape
can read
Landsat multi-spectral scanner data
(\fIi.tape.mss\fP),
Landsat thematic mapper data,
(\fIi.tape.tm\fP),
and
other formats, such as scanned aerial photography
or SPOT satellite data
(\fIi.tape.other\fP).
They extract the band data into cell files in a GRASS database.
Each band becomes a separate cell file, with standard GRASS data
layer support, and can be displayed
and analyzed just like any other cell file.
.SH "UNREGISTERED DATA"
The band data extracted from tapes is assumed to be
unregistered data. This means that the GRASS software does
not know the Earth coordinates for pixels in the image.
The only coordinates known at the time of extraction are the
columns and the rows relative to the way the data was stored on the
tape.

Data can only be extracted into a database which has an x,y
coordinate system, and not into a projected database (e.g., a UTM database).
This is to prevent users from mixing the unregistered
data with registered data in the same database.
The GRASS system comes with the database
.I imagery
which is an x,y database.
New databases can be created by users during GRASS startup.
See the manual entry
.I GRASS
for instructions on creating a new database.
.SH "CELL HEADERS"
The cell headers for the band files in these x,y databases are set
to reflect the rows and columns of the extracted data.
The north-south values represent the rows and the east-west
values represent the columns. The resolution of the unregistered
data is set to 1.

Note, however, that
while the row numbers increase from 1 to n from north to
south, GRASS requires that the window values decrease from
north to south. The solution adopted was to represent the rows
with negative values (i.e., -1 to -n). This allows them to
decrease from north to south and, if the minus sign is
ignored, to reflect the row numbers.

The cell headers for the layers in x,y databases are set
so that the coordinates at the center of each pixel
exactly reflect the row and column for that pixel.
The northern edge is set to 0.5 less than the first
row, the southern edge 0.5 larger than the last row, the west to 0.5
less than the first column, and the east to 0.5 larger than the last
column.
When
the image is displayed on the graphics monitor, the
.I Dwhere
command will report rows and columns.

.ne 11
For example, suppose rows 100-500 and columns 200-800 are extracted.
Then the cell headers for the extracted data will be given the following
values:

.RS
.RS
.TS
ln.
north:	-99.5
south:	-500.5
west:	199.5
east:	800.5
ns res:	1.0
ew res:	1.0

.SH WINDOW AND MASK
Since the data layers are given essentially contrived cell headers,
users must exercise extra care when analyzing or displaying unregistered
images. It is very easy for the user's GRASS window to have absolutely
no relationship to the data he is trying to display. This could happen when
the window is set for data extracted from one tape, but the analysis
is attempted on data extracted from another tape. A good habit to
develop is to set the window to exactly match one of the band files.
This can be done using either the GRASS
.I window
or
.I Gwindow
commands.

Another pitfall is to have a mask set to a band file from one
data set while trying to read another. Even if the window is set
properly, the data will appear to be all no-data since the
mask will effectively knock out any data. Be sure that the mask
is either set to a related data layer or not set at all. See
.I mask
for information on setting and unsetting the mask.

Please note that the tape extraction routines set your database
window to match the rows and columns of the data that is extracted.
.SH GROUPS
Since the band files are individual cell files, it is necessary to
have a mechanism to maintain a relationship between band files
from the same image as well as cell files derived from the band files.
The GRASS
.I group
data structure accomplishes this goal. The group is essentially a list
of names of cell files that belong in the group.
For user convenience, 
groups are also created (and updated) by the tape extraction routines.
The tape extraction programs ask the user to supply a group name as well as
to specify the bands to be extracted. Suppose that the user extracts
bands 1, 2, and 3 into a group called
.I nhap.
Then the band files will become the cell files 
.I nhap.1,
.I nhap.2,
and
.I nhap.3
and the group
.I nhap
will list these 3 cell files as members of the group.

Groups can also
be created and modified by the user using the GRASS command
.I i.group.
.SH "IMAGE REGISTRATION AND RECTIFICATION"
Image registration and image rectification is the process of
associating Earth coordinates with pixels on the image and then
converting the unregistered cell files to cell files in a projected
database.

Image registration
(\fIi.points\fP)
is applied to a group, rather than to individual cell files.
The control points are stored in the group, 
allowing all related band files to be registered in one step
rather than individually.

Image rectification
(\fIi.rectify\fP)
is applied to individual cell files, with the
control points for the group used to control the rectification
and the group target
(\fIi.target\fP)
used to specify the database where the rectified layer will live.
.SH IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
Image classification methods process all or a subset of the band files
as a unit. 
Spectral signatures for the image are generated
(\fIi.cluster\fP)
and then used to produce a landcover map
(\fIi.maxlik\fP).

The signatures must be associated only with the cell files
actually used in the analysis. This means that with a group
.I subgroups
must be created
(\fIi.group\fP)
which list the band files to be grouped for classification
purposes. The signatures are stored with the subgroup.

Note that multiple subroups can be created within a group. This allows
different classifications to be run with different combinations
of band files.

Also note that cell files produced by the classification process
(\fIi.maxlik\fP)
are automatically listed as part of the group.
.SH RECTIFIED VS. UNRECTIFIED ANALYSIS
There are two possible routes for processing image data.
The first is to register the group (\fIi.points\fP),
perform the analyses on the unrectified band data (\fIi.maxlik\fP),
and then rectify the results (\fIi.rectify\fP).
The second is to register the group (\fIi.points\fP),
rectify the band data (\fIi.rectify\fP),
then run analyses on the rectified band data
in the target location (\fIi.rectify\fP).
Both routes are permissible in GRASS.
Users will most likely prefer the first.
The second route requires leaving GRASS and re-running
the GRASS under the target location. It also will require
that a group be created to hold the rectified band files since
.I i.rectify
does not create or modify groups.
Also
spatial filtering may not be as effective on rectified data
since the rectifiction of the data requires resampling the original
data.
