NAME
     paint - Hardcopy color output system.

INTRODUCTION
     The paint system allows the user to produce color hardcopy
     maps of vector and cell file data at any scale. For a
     discussion of the paint functions, see the manual entries
     paint[1], Pmap[2], and Pselect[2].

PAINT DEVICES
     Paint supports multiple color printers using a device driver
     concept. The user programs (paint, Pmap, etc) send graphics
     requests to device dependent paint drivers. These drivers
     translate the application requests into device dependent
     requests to produce the maps.

INSTALLING A PAINT DRIVER
     A number of paint drivers have been distributed with GRASS.
     The installation of a driver is a 2 step process.  The first
     is indentifying the driver(s) which correspond to the
     printer(s) on your system and compiling those drivers. The
     second is telling each driver which i/o port it is to use.


     1  The source code for the drivers lives in
        $GISBASE/paint/Drivers (GISBASE refers to the directory
        where GRASS is installed).

        The selection and compilation of the drivers is done when
        GRASS is compiled as a whole.

     2  The port configuration is handled using the Unix ln
        command.

        Each driver expects to send its output to /dev/driver.
        For example, the tek4695 driver expects to find a
        tektronix 4695 (or 4696) printer on /dev/tek4695.

        Suppose the printer is actually on /dev/tty10. Then a
        link named /dev/tek4695 is made to /dev/tty10:

               ln /dev/tty10 /dev/tek4695

NOTES
     There are 2 drivers which do not use i/o ports.  One is the
     preview driver which sends its output to the graphics screen
     instead of a hardcopy printer. This driver is very handy and
     should definitely be compiled on your system.

     The other is the null driver which is for debugging purposes
     and probably should not be compiled on your system.

     If you compile either of these drivers, you shouldn't create
     a /dev file for them.
