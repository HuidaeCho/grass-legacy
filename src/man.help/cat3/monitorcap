NAME
     monitorcap - Device driver database file format

DESCRIPTION
     The commands monitor, Dlist.mon, Dselect.mon, Drelease.mon,
     Dstart.mon, Dstatus.mon, Dstop.mon, Dwhich.mon and all
     graphics commands access a device driver database stored in
     the file $GISBASE/etc/monitorcap.  This file contains a line
     for each graphics monitor on the system.  Each line contains
     6 fields separated by colons:


     name    the name by which the user identifies the driver

     program the full pathname of the executable driver or a
             pathname relative to $GISBASE

     description
             A sort 4 or 5 word description of the driver.

     fifos   full pathnames to the input and output fifos over
             which the driver communicates with the libraries

     tty     the name of the tty from which the driver must be
             started, or empty if there is no such restriction

     msg     a message to print to the user if an attempt is made
             to start the driver from the wrong tty.

EXAMPLE
     The following is an example of a single monitor system. The
     driver may be started from any terminal and uses /dev/fifo.a
     and /dev/fifo.b for communication with application programs:

     x:driver/X:graphics monitor:/dev/fifo.a /dev/fifo.b::any terminal

     This example has 2 monitor on the system, using the same
     device driver.  Note that each has a different name field
     and uses a different pair of fifos. Also, each must be
     started on a specific terminal:

     1:driver/X:monitor 1:/dev/fifo.1a /dev/fifo.1b:/dev/tty8:tty8
     2:driver/X:monitor 2:/dev/fifo.2a /dev/fifo.2b:/dev/tty10:tty10

NOTES
     Each line in this file must refer to a valid driver. No
     comment lines are supported. Also no blank lines are
     allowed.
