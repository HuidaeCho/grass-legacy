DESCRIPTION
     This describes the sites S interface option. See also manual
     entry sites(1).

SPECIAL ADJUSTMENT
     Due to the fact that S references all subscripts beginning
     with 1, and the GIS data begins with 0, it was necessary to
     add 1 to the category numbers.  Therefore category 0 ("no
     data") becomes category 1, category 1 becomes category 2,
     etc.

S DATA STRUCTURES
     Below are descriptions of the data structures created by the
     interface.  As a general comment, within S, simply typing
     the data structure name will display the values contained in
     the structure.  You may also find it interesting to display
     the data structures using the S function dput().

cat.histo, (cat.#.histo)
     This structure contains the histogram for the categories in
     each map layer.  The histogram is the number of cells of
     each category which occur in the window (see wind.n, et al,
     below).  It is a 2 dimensional integer array (matrix).  The
     first subscript references the map layer.  The second
     subscript references the category.

     examples:

        cat.histo[2,5] is the cell count for layer 2, category 5.
        cat.histo[2,]  is the full histogram for layer 2.

     note: since more than one layer may occur in the data, and
     the number of categories in each layer varies, it was
     necessary to create this structure with sufficient dimension
     to hold the largest category for all layers. Histogram data
     for categories which do not occur are set to NA (S notation
     for no data). However, there is also an individual histogram
     structure for each layer: cat.1.histo, cat.2.histo, etc.
     These are simple vectors.


cat.name
     This structure contains the names for the categories in each
     map layer. It is a 2 dimensional character array (matrix).
     The first subscript references the map layer.  The second
     subscript references the category.

     examples:

        cat.name[2,5] is the name of category 5 for layer 2.
        cat.name[2,]  are all category names for layer 2.

     note: since more than one layer may occur in the data, and
     the number of categories in each layer varies, it was
     necessary to create this structure with sufficient dimension
     to hold the largest category for all layers.  Names for
     categories which do not occur are set to ''.  However, there
     is also an individual category name structure for each
     layer: cat.1.name, cat.2.name, etc.  These are simple
     vectors.



site.data
     This structure contains the data for each site.  It is a 3
     dimensional integer array.  The first subscript references
     the categories which occured at the site.  The second
     subscript references the site.  The third subscript
     references the layer.

     examples:

        site.data[,5,3] is the data for site 5 in layer 3.
        site.data[,2,]  is the data for site 2 in all layers.
        site.data[,,1]  is all site data for layer 1.

     note: the size of the first dimension will be the number of
     cells in a site, the size of the second dimension will be
     the number of sites, the size of the third dimension will be
     the number of layers.



site.mode
     Since S does not provide a statistical mode function, this
     structure contains the most frequently occuring category for
     each site in each layer.  It is a 2 dimensional integer
     array (matrix).  The first subscript references the site.
     The second subscript references the layer.

     examples:

        site.mode[5,3] is the mode for site 5 in layer 3.
        site.mode[2,]  are the modes for site 2 in all layers.
        site.mode[,1]  are all site modes for layer 1.

     note: this 'mode' is not the strict definition of the mode.
     Since category 0 (which in S is category 1) represents "no
     data" in the GIS databases, it was excluded from the mode
     calculations (essentially as if it had been NA).  For
     example, if the data for a site is 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 2 3 1 1,
     the mode will be 2.

layer.name
     This structure contains the gridcell layer names.  It is a 2
     dimensional array, (ie a matrix).  The first subscript
     references the layer.  The second subscript selects either
     the layer name, or the layer title.


     examples:

        layer.name[3,1] is the name of layer 3.
        layer.name[3]   is also the name of layer 3.
        layer.name[2]   is the name of layer 2.
        layer.name[3,2] is the title for layer 3.


location
     This is a simple character vector giving the GIS location
     from which the data was extracted.


mapset
     This is a simple character vector giving the GIS mapset.


nlayers
     This is a simple integer giving the number of layers.


nsites
     This is a simple integer giving the number of sites.

site.e
     This is a simple integer vector giving the easting for each
     site.

site.n
     This is a simple integer vector giving the northing for each
     site.

site.name
     This is a simple character vector giving name for each site.

sitelist
     This is a simple character vector giving the name and
     description of the site list file from which the sites were
     taken.

wind.n, wind.s, wind.w, wind.e
     These are simple real numbers giving the north, south, west,
     east of the mapset window.

S MACROS
     You may find the following S macros helpful when referencing
     the 'site.data' and 'site.mode' structures since they allow
     you to specify parameters:


     MACRO site.data(site, layer)
     ({
          site.data[ , site, layer]
     })
     END

     MACRO site.mode(site, layer)
     ({
          site.mode[site, layer]
     })
     END



MACRO USAGE
     To select the site.data for all sites for layer 2:

          ?site.data(layer=2)

     to select the site.data for site 4 in all layers:

          ?site.data(site=4)

     to select the site.mode for site 10 in layer 1:

          ?site.mode(layer=1,site=10)


SORRY, BUT ...
     These macros are not provided by the interface.  To use
     these macros, you will have to type them into a text file
     and then, from S, issue the command:

          define("<file>")
