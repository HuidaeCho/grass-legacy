.br
.I (D Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Dmove
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dmove 
is an
.I interactive
Bourne shell macro which, using the 
.I D
commands
.I "Dsave, Dchoose, Dremove and Derase, "
moves a window containing mapped information on the screen to a new user-chosen
screen location.

.SH LIMITATIONS
Since
.I Dsave
command does not catch input to such commands as 
.I "Dpoints, Dsites,"
and
.I Dmapgraph,
the moved window may not be regenerated exactly.
Note that ONLY maps can be moved.  Although a manual entry exists, the
programming for this utility is incomplete.  Use of Dmove during
demonstrations should be avoided.
