DESCRIPTION

.in +0.5i
I_pat_place is an interactive and graphic version of the GRASS function "Gpat_place".  Instead of the non-interactive and relatively cumbersome approach of entering the parameters of the function on the command line, the user can step through the various parts of placing a pattern on the landscape using the mouse (or any available pointing device) to choose an option from a display menu of available choices.  Menus will pop down and roll up as needed.

The user can make his choices from the main menu options.  Most choices made on the main menu will route program control to another menu.  From there, choices will either display another menu or execute a command.  While executing different functions, the user is often given messages or prompted to type specific requested information inside the "talk window".

1)  
.R
The user chooses a base map to be shown in the display window (which becomes the current window upon entering the program) using the options 
.B
overlay --> perm/user --> basemap.

2)  
.R
The user defines the pattern that has to be placed over the base map.  This is done with the menu choices 
.B
pattern --> any_pattern.

The chosen pattern is displayed (according to the scale of the base map) in one corner of the active window.

3)  
.R
After choosing the options 
.B
place --> locate 
.R
, the user clicks near the origin of the pattern and, holding down the middle mouse button, moves the pattern on the base map to the desired location.  Upon releasing the button, the user is prompted for the desired angular rotation.  This may be done by holding down the left or right mouse button to rotate counter-clockwise or clockwise until the rotation is correct.  The user is then asked to confirm the final position of the pattern.  If he answers "Y", the pattern is globally registered on the base map.  If he answers "N", then he may translate and rotate the pattern again.

4)  
.R
In its final position, the pattern overlayed on a base map can be stored in a dlg-3 (optional format) file by activating the 
.B
store 
.R
function and typing a unique filename when prompted for one.

5)  
.R 
Previously stored registered pattern overlays can be displayed over base maps by following step 1 and then recalling the pattern overlay using the sequence 
.B
overlay --> perm/user --> placed_pattern_overlay.
.R
Changes can be made to this recalled pattern by activating the function 
.B
locate 
.R
and following the procedure in step 3.  The altered plan can be stored by overwriting the old file.
