dlg_to_cell \- convert dlg file to grass grid cell file

.I (Map Development Tool)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.I dlg_to_cell
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I dlg_to_cell
is the fourth and final phase of the
.I MAPDEV
system for converting a hard copy map to a
.I GRASS
grid cell map.
.I dlg_to_cell
is a non-interactive program that transforms a
.I dlg-3
file into a
.I GRASS
cell file.
.sp
The current
.I gis
window must encompass the entire
.I dlg-3
map area, because only the area of the
map that is inside the current window will be transformed.  Before running
.I dlg_to_cell
make sure that the current window is correctly set and the resolution is at the 
desired level, or an empty cell map may be created.
An empty cell map will also be created if the
.I dlg
file hasn't been labeled (no attributes/categories).
The support files for the cell can be created using
.I support(1).
.SH "IMPROVEMENTS"
.br
There a couple of different things that could cause a null map or no map to
be created.  Should be better error messages to indicate exactly where the
problem is.
