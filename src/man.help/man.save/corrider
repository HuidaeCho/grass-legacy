NAME
     corridor - find a least-cost path

SYNOPSIS
     corridor

DESCRIPTION
     Corridor evaluates an existing cost surface map in search of
     a least cost path between a user provided starting point and
     one or more ending points.  The user is asked to provide the
     name  of  an existing cost map, the starting coordinates and
     the ending coordinate(s).

     The cost surface is a grid-cell map containing  values  (not
     category  numbers)  reflecting  the  cost of traversing that
     grid cell.  This is constructed ahead of  time  using  other
     GRASS programs.

     The starting coordinates are input at the keyboard.   Ending
     points  can  be  entered at the keyboard or through a second
     input map.  You are prompted for 0 or more points input from
     the keyboard and are then asked to name a map which contains
     more ending points.  Points can be input in either  or  both
     modes.   Any  non-zero location in a map is considered to be
     an ending location.

     Finally, you are asked to give the name of  an  output  map.
     The  output  result  will  contain  the lowest total cost of
     traversing the space between each of the grid-cells and  any
     of the starting locations.   Consider the following example:

     Input:                            Output:
        COST SURFACE                      LEAST COST PATH

     The user-provided starting location in the above example  is
     the  boxed  3  in the left-hand map.  The ending location is
     the boxed 2 in the upper left.  The path in the output shows
     the lowest cost corridor for moving from the starting box to
     the lowest possible point.  This  is  the  path  a  raindrop

     would take in this landscape.

CAVEATS
     This program does not abide by the nice map data  resampling
     and masking conventions of GRASS.  In particular:

     No mask -
          The input and output files are not masked.

     No resampling -
          The input map are not resampled to the current  window.
          The  output map will cover exactly the same area as the
          input map.

     Square cells -
          The grid-cells of the input map must be square.
