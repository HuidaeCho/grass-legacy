NAME
     Glos - Line of sight analysis tool
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Glos elev_layer=name [patt_layer=name] east=value
          north=value [obs_elev=value] [max_dist=value]
          out_layer=name

DESCRIPTION
     Glos generates an output map on which the cells that are
     visible from a user-specified observer location are marked
     with integer values that represent the vertical angle (in
     degrees) required to see those cells. The input to the
     program is as follows:

     elev_layer
          File name of a grid cell layer containing elevation
          data.

     patt_layer
          File name of a 1/0 grid cell map layer which has cells
          within the areas of interest coded with 1 while the
          rest are coded with '0'. If omitted, the analysis will
          be performed for the whole area within a certain
          distance of the viewing point inside the database
          window.

     east, north
          Coordinates identifying the desired location of the
          viewing point.

     obs_elev
          Height of the observer (in meters) above the viewing
          point's elevation.  If omitted, a default value of
          1.75m is assumed.

     max_dist
          Maximum distance (in meters) from the viewing point
          inside of which the line of sight analysis will be
          performed. The grid cells outside this distance range
          are coded with '0'. If omitted, a default maximum
          distance of 100 grid cells is assumed.

     out_layer
          File name of the data layer in which the results will
          be stored.

NOTES
     For accurate results, the program must be run with the
     window resolution equal to the resolution of the data.

     It is advisable to use a 'pattern layer' which identifies
     the areas of interest in which the line of sight analysis is
     required.  Such a measure will reduce the time taken by the
     program to run.
