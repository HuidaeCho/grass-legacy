NAME
     Gfindfile  - Search for database files
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gfindfile element name [mapset]

DESCRIPTION
     Gfindfile is designed for Bourne shell scripts that need to
     search for cell files, vector files, site list files, window
     files, and imagery group files in the database.


     element
          The database element (i.e., directory within the GRASS
          mapset location) to be searched.

     name The name of the data file for which to search.

     mapset
          Where to search. If not specified, all mapsets in the
          user's search path are searched. Otherwise, the
          specified mapset is searched.  As a convenience, if
          specified as a single dot (.) only the current mapset
          is searched.

OUTPUT
     Gfindfile writes three lines to standard output:

          name=[somename]
          mapset=[somemapset]
          file=[filename]

     The output is /bin/sh commands to set the variable name to
     the database file name, mapset to the mapset where the file
     resides, and file to the full UNIX name for the database
     file. These variables may be set in the /bin/sh as follows:

          eval `Gfindfile element name`

NOTES
     If the specified file does not exist the variables will be
     set as follows:

          name=
          mapset=
          file=

     The following is a way to test for this case:

          if [ ! "$file" ]
          then
