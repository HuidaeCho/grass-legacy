NAME
     Vprune - Perform pruning on vector

SYNOPSIS
     Vprune input=if output=of thresh=threshold

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS tool Vprune allows the user to remove extra points
     from a vector This allows one to reduce disk space required
     by a vector and still have data accuracy within a given
     tolerance.
     The progam expects three command line arguments:  input,
     which is the vector containing the data to be pruned,
     output, which is the resultant pruned and thresh, which is
     the threshold value at which to prune.  This threshold value
     is the same as the digit[1] pruning threshold.  This is
     specified in units (e.g., in meters for UTM).  The threshold
     can also be specified in inches on the map, and the program
     will convert these to units using the scale in the vector To
     differentiate between the two, you must specifiy inches by
     typing the letter 'i' immediately following the threshold
     value (e.g.,  0.04i).  The input will be read and the
     resultant pruned will be placed into a newly created output
     leaving the original unchanged.  The pruning algorithm
     throws away redundant points within the specified threshold.
     It works on each separately, working from node to node.  It
     does not change the position or number of nodes.

NOTES
     This program is called by prune[1] .
