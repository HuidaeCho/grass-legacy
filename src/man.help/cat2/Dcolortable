NAME
     Dcolortable - To display the color table associated with a
     cell file

SYNOPSIS
     Dcolortable name=cell_file [color=color] [lines=num_lines] [cols=num_cols]

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS tool Dcolortable is used to display the color
     table associated with a cell file in the current window.
     The cell_file named should be an available cell file in the
     user's mapset and location.  Options can be stated either
     positionally or explicitly on the command line (see
     DINTRO[2D]).  If options are not entered on the command
     line, defaults are used.  If options are entered
     positionally on the command line, a dash - can be used to
     indicate that the default should be used for the option at
     that position.  Options are:
     color=color
          Color of the lines separating the colors of the color
          table.  If no color is stated on the command line,
          Dcolortable defaults to the use of black lines.
     lines=num_lines
     cols=num_cols
          If num_lines and num_cols are not specified,
          Dcolortable divides the current window equally among
          the number of categories present in the named cell
          file.  If one option is specified, the other is
          automatically set  to accommodate all categories.  If
          both are specified, as many categories as possible are
          displayed.

EXAMPLE
     The user running the command:

     Dcolortable name=soils color=red lines=1 cols=3

     would see the current window divided into three columns
     extending the full window height.  The lines dividing the
     color table associated with the soils map would be displayed
     in red.  The user would see, at most, only three of the
     colors from the soils color table displayed in the current
     window (because the user requested that this window be
     divided into three sections).

NOTES
     If the user wishes to display the entire color table
     associated with a map, the user should stipulate a number of
     lines (rows) and columns sufficient to accommodate the
     number of categories in the map's color table.  If the user
     runs Dcolortable using the default number of lines and
     columns (the full window), all categories from the map's

     color table will be displayed.  However, if the user
     requests that the color table associated with a map which
     has 10 data categories be displayed in a window with only 3
     lines (rows) and 2 columns (a total of six cells), only six
     of the ten categories will be displayed.

     The user should run the GRASS tool Derase between runs of
     Dcolortable to avoid confusion.
