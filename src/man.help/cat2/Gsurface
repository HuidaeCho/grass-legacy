NAME
     Gsurface - Surface generation tool
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gsurface input=name output=name

DESCRIPTION
     Gsurface fills a with interpolated generated from a set of
     irregularly spaced using numerical approximation (weighted
     averaging) techniques. The interpolated of a cell is
     determined by of nearby and the distance of the cell from
     those In comparison with other methods, numerical
     approximation allows representation of more complex surfaces
     (particularly those with anomalous features), restricts the
     spatial influence of any errors, and generates the
     interpolated surface from the It is the most appropriate
     method to apply to most spatial data.

     The command line input is as follows:

     input   cell map that contains a set of irregularly spaced
             (i.e., some cells contain known values while the
             rest contain zero (0)).

     output  cell map that represents a smooth surface generated
             from the known values in the input

NOTES
     The amount of memory used by this program is related to the
     number of non-zero values in the input If the input is very
     dense, ie, contains a lot of non-zero the program may not be
     able to get all the memory it needs from the system.  The
     time required to execute increases with the number of
