NAME
     MdmaUSGSread - Extracts DTED data distributed by the USGS
     (Map Development Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     dd [if=tapedev] ibs=input block size| MdmaUSGSread arg1 arg2
     arg3 arg4

DESCRIPTION
     MdmaUSGSread extracts elevation data (DTED) produced by the
     Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) from USGS-created tapes.
     Extracted data is placed into a file called dem_data in the
     user's current directory.  This program requires the use of
     the UNIX command dd to read the 1/2 inch magnetic tape.
     MdmaUSGSread should be used prior to using the GRASS tools
     Mrot90and Mimport.ll.


     if   the pathname of the input tape drive (usually
          /dev/rmt0)

     ibs  the physical blocking value of the data on tape,
          usually written on the tape spool.  If this value is
          unknown, run examine.tape prior to MdmaUSGSread.

     arg1 beginning row number of data (default = 1)

     arg2 beginning column number of data (default = 1)

     arg3 ending row number of data (default = 1201)

     arg4 ending column number of data (default = 1201)

EXAMPLE:
     For example, the command:

     dd if=/dev/rmt0 ibs=10240 | MdmaUSGSread 1 1 400 500

     will extract data from /dev/rmt0 and put the first 400 rows
     and first 500 columns into the file dem_data located in the
     user's current directory.
