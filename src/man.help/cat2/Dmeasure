NAME
     Dmeasure - Tool used to measure feature lengths and areas
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dmeasure [forecolor=color] [backcolor=color]

DESCRIPTION
     Dmeasure provides the user with a way to measure the lengths
     and areas of lines and polygons that the user has drawn on
     the monitor.  Lines and polygons are drawn using a pointing
     device (mouse).  A mouse button menu indicates that the user
     can find out the screen coordinates of the cursor location,
     draw line segments between user-specified vertices, and quit
     Dmeasure.  Lines and polygons are defined by the series of
     vertices marked by the user.  If more than two successive
     vertices are drawn, Dmeasure prints the area encompassed
     (Dmeasure will assume the area is closed even if the user
     has not joined the first and last vertices).  Line lengths
     are stated in the same units as those of the current
     database.  Areas are stated in both square miles and
     hectares.

     Options that can be used with Dmeasure are the foreground
     and background colors of line segments drawn on the screen.
     If these options are not stated on the commmand line,
     Dmeasure will default to the use of a foreground color of
     white, and a background color of black.

NOTES
     The GRASS tool display also offers a way to measure line
     lengths and areas through its measurements option.  If the
     measurement program is run through display, however, default
     line segment foreground and background colors will be used.
