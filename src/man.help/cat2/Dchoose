NAME
     Dchoose - Chooses a window in which to display graphics
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dchoose [window_name]

DESCRIPTION
     A window created with the Dnew command is assigned through
     the use of Dchoose to become the current window.  (Dnew will
     create additional windows, but it will not change the
     assignment of the current window.)  Although many windows
     can coexist on the screen, only one window can be the
     current window at any given time.  Commands such as
     Derase[2D], Dcell[2D], Dgrid[2D] and Dvect[2D] perform
     actions on or within the current window.  The border of the
     current window (the window most recently chosen with
     Dchoose) will be highlighted in white by Dchoose.  If the
     user points with the mouse to an area which is the
     intersection of two overlapping windows, Dchoose will choose
     the window that was created earlier as the current window.
     Dchoose can be given an argument to specify a window by its
     name.  For example, the command:

     Dchoose full_screen

     can be used to choose the full screen as the current window.
     Window names are printed to the screen when running such
     programs as Dnew, Dchoose, and Dstatus.  Dchoose also has an
     interactive mode, if run without any arguments.  In this
     case, the pointing device (mouse) is used to choose the
     window which will act as the current window.  A menu
     indicates which actions correspond with the use of each
     mouse button.

NOTES
     Dchoose will not complain if no window yet exists to be
     chosen;  if this happens, no action is taken by Dchoose.

     If the user runs Dchoose without stipulating a window name
     on the command line, Dchoose will name the window. In
     general, this name will be a pound sign followed by a number
     (e.g., #3).

LIMITATIONS
     Information in a window which is covered by another window
     is lost when overwritten.
