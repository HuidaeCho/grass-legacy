NAME
     Dremove - Removes graphics window
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dremove [window_name]

DESCRIPTION
     Dremove provides a method for removing windows individually
     from the graphics screen.  If a window name is provided in
     the command line, that window is removed from the graphics
     device.  If no window name is provided, Dremove runs
     interactively, using the pointing device (mouse) to indicate
     which window is to be removed.  Dremove will not remove the
     current window.

BUGS
     The current window cannot be removed;  to Dremove this
     window you must first use Dchoose to choose another window
     as the current window.
