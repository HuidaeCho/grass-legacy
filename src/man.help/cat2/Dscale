NAME
     Dscale - Adds a map scale to a map displayed in the current
     window
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dscale [color1 [color2]]
     Dscale [option=value] [option=value]

DESCRIPTION
     Dscale displays a scale and North arrow in the current
     window.  It is automatically proportioned to fit
     appropriately in the upper left corner of the current
     window.  It is drawn twice in two different colors; the
     default (if unspecified on the command line) is the use of a
     white scale on a black background.  Options are:

     color1=color
          Color used for the first drawing of the scale
          (background).  Default is black.
     color2=color
          Color used for second drawing of the scale (offset).
          Default is white.

     Available colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
     indigo, violet, gray, brown, magenta, white, and black.
     Background and offset colors can be stated either
     positionally or explicitly on the command line.

BUGS
     The user has no option to choose where the scale is drawn on
     the screen, and Dscale assumes that units are in meters.
     The scale that Dscale generates is not suitable for very
     tiny maps.
