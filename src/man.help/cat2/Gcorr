NAME
     Gcorr - Prints correlation matrix for cell files
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gcorr layer1 [layer2] ...

DESCRIPTION
     Gcorr prints a correlation matrix for user-specified grid
     cell data layers.  The layer name(s) MUST be supplied on the
     command line. The output can be saved by redirecting it into
     a file.

     The output is an N x N symmetric correlation matrix, where N
     is the number of cell files specified on the command line,
     e.g.,

          Gcorr layer.1 layer.2 layer.3

     would produce a 3x3 matrix (values are example only):

          1.000000   0.985860   0.714107
          0.985860   1.000000   0.671468
          0.714107   0.671468   1.000000


PRINCIPLE COMPONENTS
     This module can be used as the first step of a principle
     components transformation.  The correlation matrix would be
     input into a system which determines eigen values and eigen
     vectors. An NxN correlation matrix would result in N real
     eigen values and N eigen vectors (each composed of N real
     numbers). In the above example, the eigen values and
     corresponding eigen vectors for the correlation matrix are:

 component   eigen value                 eigen vector
     1        2.589790     <   -0.708080   -0.697934   -0.612839   >
     2        0.012327     <   -0.669069    0.630271    0.055261   >
     3        0.397883     <    0.300597    0.388328   -0.789561   >

     The component corresponding to each vector can be produced
     using Gmapcalc as follows:

     Gmapcalc 'pc.1 = -0.708080*layer.1 - 0.697934*layer.2 - 0.612839*layer.3'
     Gmapcalc 'pc.2 = -0.669069*layer.1 + 0.630271*layer.2 + 0.055261*layer.3'
     Gmapcalc 'pc.3 = 0.300597*layer.1 + 0.388328*layer.1 - 0.789561*layer.3'

     Note that based on the relative sizes of the eigen values,
     pc.1 will contain about 86% of the variance in the data set,
     pc.2 will contain less than 1% of the variance in the data
     set, and pc.3 will contain about 13% of the variance in the
     data set.

     Also, note that the range of values produced in pc.1, pc.2,
     and pc.3 will not (in general) be the same as those for
     layer.1, layer.2, and layer.3.  It may be necessary to
     rescale pc.1, pc.2 and pc.3 to the desired range (e.g. 0-
     255).  This can be done with rescale or Grescale.

NOTES
     Code to produce eigen vectors is currently under
     development. If your system has a fortran compiler, then the
     program eigensystem can be compiled and used to generate the
     eigen values and vectors.
