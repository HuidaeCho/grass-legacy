NAME
     Pscreen - Paint screen image file saved by Dsavescreen

SYNPOSIS
     Pscreen savedfile [-bw] [-w#] [-#[p/i]]

DESCRIPTION
     Pscreen paints the screen image file created by Dsavescreen
     on the the color printer. The options which may be specified
     are:

     -bw  Select black and white reversal. Whatever is specified
          as black in the original is painted as white, and
          whatever was white is painted as black.

     -w#  Force color # to white. Enables user to set the
          background color to white without having to reverse all
          black and white.  For example -w0 will set color 0 to
          white.

     -#[p/i]
          This option selects the output scaling. If not
          specified, the is scaled to fill the width of the
          printer (i.e., -1p, 1 panel wide). Otherwise, it has
          three formats:


          -#   outputs the at the ratio 1 image pixel to #
               printer pixels.  (i.e., -4 will print the at 1
               image pixel = 4 printer pixels).  This option is
               useful if the resampling of the must be
               controlled.

               Since rescaling often entails dropping some input
               pixels or repeating some input pixels more often
               than others, linear elements in the may be
               distorted. This effect can be eliminated by
               specifying -1 as the scaling factor.

          -#p  outputs the # panels wide (i.e., -3p will print
               the 3 panels wide).

          -#i  outputs the # inches wide (i.e., -8.5i will print
               the 8.5 inches wide).

NOTES
     The input file to Pscreen is generated by the program
     Dsavescreen. At present, Dsavescreen only exists for
     MASSCOMP systems. If you do not have a MASSCOMP, you
     probably will not be able to save screens to be painted by
     Pscreen.
