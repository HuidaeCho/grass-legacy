NAME
     D3d - Three-dimensional map display program
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     D3d  [file=mapname]  [fe=from_easting]  [fn=from_northing]
          [fh=from_height]  [te=to_easting]  [tn=to_northing]
          [th=to_height]  [ew=east-west resolution] [ns=north-
          south resolution]  [lf=line_freq] [exag=exaggeration]
          [ef=elev_file]  [va=view_angle]

DESCRIPTION
     D3d provides device-independent 3-dimensional graphic images
     based on GRASS grid cell maps.  The user identifies the
     viewing location, the line of sight, the view angle, a
     vertical exaggeration factor, and the map to be used for
     "elevation" data.  This program is a non-interactive version
     of the GRASS tool d.3d.  Refer to the d.3d manual entry for
     a detailed examination of the production of three-
     dimensional images in GRASS, and of specific parameters.
     Three-dimensional images can also be generated through the
     GRASS display program.


          file=map_name
               Name of the map to be displayed in 3-d.

          fe=from_easting

          fn=from_northing

          fh=from_height
               The 3-d location of the viewing location.
               Defaults to 30,000 units high, and just southwest
               of the current window.

          te=to_elevation

          tn=to_northing

          th=to_height
               The 3-d location to appear in the center of the
               graphics window.  Defaults to 0 units high, and
               the center of the display window.

          ew=east-west resolution

          ns=north-south resolution

          lf=line_frequency
               Black lines are drawn on the 3-d image to improve
               the image.  This value is the number of rows and

               columns to skip between lines.  Defaults to 10.  0
               means "no lines".

          exag=exaggerating_file
               This value is multiplied times the "elevations" in
               the elevation file.  Defaults to 2.

          ef=elevation_file
               Name of the file to provide the elevation values.
               Generally, this is something like "elevation", but
               can be any file.

          va=viewing_angle
               The field of view in the image.  Defaults to 40
               degrees.

     The image is drawn in the current graphics window.  The D
     language program Dscreen can be run before running D3d run
     to prepare the a full-screen window for graphics.  Refer to
     the GRASS tool D3d.view for a demonstration of the D3d
     program.
