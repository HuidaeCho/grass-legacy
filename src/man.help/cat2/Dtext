NAME
     Dtext - Draws text in the current graphics window
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dtext [color [size [line]]]
     Dtext [color=value] [size=value] [line=value]

DESCRIPTION
     Dtext draws text in the current graphics window. Text is
     provided through standard input.  Options are text color,
     size, and line number.  These options can be stated either
     positionally or explicitly on the command line (see
     DINTRO[2D]), and are entered on the command line as:

     color=color
          Color desired for drawing text.  Sets the current color
          to that stated.  Options are red, orange, green, blue,
          indigo, violet, black, white, gray, yellow, brown, and
          magenta.  The default, if unspecified, is white text.
     size=number
          Height of letters in percent (between 0-100) of
          available window height.  The default, if unspecified,
          is 10.
     line=line_number
          The screen line number on which text will be begun to
          be drawn (line 1 is at the top of the screen).  If
          unspecified, text will begin by default on line 1.


     In addition to the options provided on the command line,
     colors, text size, font type, and boldness can be adjusted
     with commands in the standard input (i.e., if the user
     invokes Dtext without options on the command line, and then
     assigns values to these options on lines within the standard
     input).

     The command:
      .C color
     (where color is one of the available colors) causes text
     appearing on subsequent lines to be drawn in that color.

     Text size can be adjusted with the command:
      .S size
     (where size is a percentage within the range 0 to 100).
     Note that a size of 10 would allow 10 lines to be drawn in
     the window, 5 would allow the drawing of 20 lines, and 50
     would allow the drawing of 2 lines.

     Font type can be manipulated using the command:
      .F font
     (where font is one of the fonts known by the GRASS tool

     Dfont).  Available fonts are listed in the GRASS manual
     entry for Dfont[2D].  The default font used (if unspecified
     by the user) is romanp.  Run the GRASS macro Dshow.fonts to
     see what these fonts look like.

     The user can also stipulate that text be printed in bold on
     lines beneath the command:
      .B 1
     This command means bold on .
     Similarly, the command:
      .B 0
     turns bold off of all text appearing on lines beneath it.
     (Bold off is the default, if unspecified.)

EXAMPLE
     The following command will print the short phrase "This is a
     test of Dtext" in the current window using the color yellow,
     in bold, and using 4/100 ths (4%) of the window's vertical
     space per line:
            Dtext
            .C yellow
            .S 4
            .B 1
            This is a test of Dtext
     The user presses control-d (the "ctrl" and "d" keys) to halt
     input.

NOTES
     Note that the GRASS command Dtitle creates map titles in a
     format suitable for input to Dtext.

NEEDS
     Dtext needs escape sequences that can be used within lines
     to change colors, boldness, and perhaps size.
