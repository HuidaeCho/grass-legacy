NAME
     Gwindow - Window management program
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gwindow parms

DESCRIPTION
     Gwindow is a command-line interface for setting/querying the
     current window.  The user enters the command  Gwindow parms,
     where parms are the following parameters:

     n=x           set window north to x
     s=x           set window south to x
     e=x           set window east to x
     w=x           set window west to x
     res=x         set both north/south and east/west resolutions to x
     ewres=x       set east/west resolution to x
     nsres=x       set north/south resolution to x

     window=name   set window from database window name
     save=name     write current window to database window name
     layer=name    set window from cell header for layer name
     zoom=name     set window to smallest window containing data from layer name
     default       set window from default window for the database

     print         print the current window (to stdout)
     gprint        print the current window (to stdout) in a format which
                   can be given back to Gwindow on its command line

     -             do not actually set the database window.

     Any combination of parameters may be specified. They are
     applied in the order specified. Missing parameters leave the
     current window values unchanged.

EXAMPLES
     Gwindow n=7360100 e=699000

          will reset the north and east for the current window,
          but leave the south, west, and the window resolutions
          unchanged.

     Gwindow default s=698000 print

          will set the current window from the default window for
          the database, reset the south to 698000, and then print
          the result.

     Gwindow n+=1000 w-=500

          The n=x may also be specified n+=x to increase the

          current north, and n-=x to decrease it. This is also
          true for s=x, e=x, and w=x.  In this case the current
          window north is increased by 1000 and the current
          window west is decreased by 500.

     Gwindow n=s+1000 e=w+1000

          This form sets the north value 1000 units larger than
          the south, and the east 1000 larger than the west.  The
          corresponding forms s=n-x and w=e-x may be used for the
          south and the west.

     Gwindow layer=soils

          This form will set the current window to be exactly the
          same as the header for the layer soils.

     Gwindow layer=soils zoom=soils

          This form will first look up the cell header for soils,
          use this as the current window, and then shrink the
          window to the smallest window which contains all the
          data in the layer soils. Note that if the parameter
          layer=soils were not specified, the zoom would begin
          with the current window.

     Gwindow - layer=soils print

          The - option suppresses the setting of the database
          window. This can be useful when it is desired to only
          extract window information. In this case, the cell
          header for the soils file is printed without changing
          the current window.

     Gwindow - layer=soils zoom=soils save=soils

          This will zoom into the smallest window which contains
          all the soils data and save it in the database window
          named soils. The current window is not changed.

     Gwindow print

          This will print the current window in the format:

               projection:   1 (UTM)
               zone:         15
               north:        4294050.00
               south:        4249950.00
               east:         526050.00
               west:         500950.00
               nsres:        100.00
               ewres:        100.00

               rows:         441
               cols:         251

     Gwindow gprint

          The gprint option prints the window in the following
          format:

               n=4294050.00
               s=4249950.00
               e=526050.00
               w=500950.00
               nsres=100.00
               ewres=100.00

          This format does not have the rows and columns, but can
          be given back to Gwindow on its command line.

          The print (or gprint) option is recognized last. This
          means that all changes are applied to the window before
          printing occurs.

NOTE
     After all updates have been applied, the current window
     south and the west are (silently) adjusted so that the
     north/south distance is a multiple of the north/south
     resolution and that the east/west distance is a multiple of
     the east/west resolution.
