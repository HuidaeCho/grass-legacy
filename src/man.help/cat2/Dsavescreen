NAME
     Dsavescreen - Screen capture utility
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dsavescreen

DESCRIPTION
     Dsavescreen captures the image on the graphics monitor for
     later painting by the GRASS tool Pscreen.  The image is
     captured in a file in /tmp. The name of the file in /tmp is
     generated by Dsavescreen and has the form /tmp/screen###
     (where ### is a random number).  The capture is a two step
     process.  The image is first captured into a file, and the
     image is then reformatted into the format required by
     Pscreen.  The capture happens interactively. The
     reformatting goes on in the background (i.e., the user can
     continue processing while waiting for the image to be
     reformatted).  Dsavescreen reports the name of the
     /tmp/screen### file after the first step is complete.  When
     the reformat step is completed, the user is notified by mail
     that the /tmp/screen### file is complete.

NOTES
     The /tmp/screen### files can be quite large. Users should
     remove these files after they have been painted.

     This command may not exist on your system. At present, only
     MASSCOMP systems have this command.
