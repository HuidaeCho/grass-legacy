NAME
     Gcats - print category labels for cell files
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gcats [-t'tabchar'] layer [catlist]

DESCRIPTION
     The category labels for the cell file layer are printed to
     the screen.  If no specific categories are list on the
     command line (using the optional catlist arguments), then
     all the catgegory labels for the data layer are printed.
     (The entire layer is read, using Gdescribe(2), to determine
     which categories occur in the layer.) If a list of
     categories are specified, then the labels for those
     categories only are printed. The catlist may be single
     catgory numbers, or ranges of numbers.

     The output is one label per line, with the category number
     first, then an ascii TAB character, then the label for the
     category.

OPTIONS
     -tc  Changes the TAB character to c (see example below).

EXAMPLES
          Gcats soils

     prints the labels for all the categories for the "soils"
     map;

          Gcats soils 10 12 15-20

     prints only the labels for categories 10, 12, and 15 through
     20; and

          Gcats -t: soils 10 20

     prints the labels for categories 10 and 20 of "soils", but
     with ":" as the separator character.

     Example output:

          10:Dumps, mine, Cc
          20:Kyle clay, KaA

NOTES
     Any ascii TAB characters which may be in the label are
     replaced by spaces.

     The output from Gcats can be redirected into a file, or
     piped into another program.
