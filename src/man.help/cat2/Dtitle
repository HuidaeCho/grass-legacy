NAME
     Dtitle - Create a title for a grid cell map
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dtitle name [color [size [fancy]]]
     Dtitle [option=value] [option=value] ...

DESCRIPTION
     Dtitle generates to standard output a string which can be
     used by Dtext to draw a title for the cell map mapname in
     the current graphics window.  Output created by Dtitle can
     be redirected into a file, or piped directly into Dtext to
     display the map title created by Dtitle.  The map title
     created will include the map layer's name, MAPSET, LOCATION,
     window coordinates, and resolution.  Dtitle can be run with
     options that can be stated explicitly or positionally on the
     command line (see DINTRO).  Options are:

     name=map_name
          An available cell file map in the user's mapset search
          path (no default file is used if this is unspecified).
     color=color
          Sets the current color to that stated.  Options are
          red, orange, green, blue, indigo, violet, black, white,
          gray, yellow, brown, and magenta.  If unspecified, the
          current color defaults to white.
     size=size
          Sets the current text size as a percentage of the
          window's vertical height to that stated.  Size can
          range between 0-100.  If unspecified, the text size
          defaults to 10% of the window's height (size=10).
     type=fancy
          Puts the cell file LOCATION name (the label's first
          line) in another color, one text size larger than the
          other lines of text in the label.

EXAMPLE
     For example, a user wishing to create a suitable title for
     the Spearfish, SD soils map layer and display this title in
     the current window might do the following:

     Dtitle soils red 5 > title.file

     Dtext < title.file

     Similarly, the user might pipe Dtitle output directly into
     Dtext:

     Dtitle soils red 5 | Dtext

NOTES
     The text created with Dtext will not necessarily fit within
     the current window;  the user should choose a text size
     appropriate to the window.
