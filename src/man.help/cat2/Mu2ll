NAME
     Mu2ll - Conversion of UTM to geographic coordinates
     (Map Development Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Mu2ll e=easting n=northing z=zone s=spheroid

DESCRIPTION
     Mu2ll converts UTM northings and eastings to geographic
     coordinates (i.e., latitudes and longitudes). The user must
     specify the UTM zone and spheroid on which the geographic
     coordinates will be based.

     The list of spheroids available is somewhat dynamic. It may
     not contain exactly the ones listed below. To determine the
     current list of possible spheroids, type in the command:

          Mu2ll e=0 n=0 z=0 s=help

     A list of available spheroids will be printed on the screen.
     If the spheroid desired is not on the list, the values for
     the semi-major axis and the eccentricity squared for the
     spheroid may be entered in place of a spheroid name in the
     following format:

          s=a=semi-major_axis,e=eccentricity_squared

     SOME POSSIBLE SPHEROIDS
     (The on-line listing includes only the spheroid names)

EXAMPLE
     Mu2ll e=533658.427 n=4193328.793 z=10 s=clark66


     Results:
         lat=37.53.19 N
         lon=122.37.02 W

         The point entered is in California and falls in UTM zone
         10. The spheroid used is the Clark 1866.

NOTES
     See Mll2u for a brief discussion of spheroids.

     The UTM zone must be included with the easting and northing
     input, because it is the zone that determines the area of
     the earth where the point is found. The same UTM coordinates
     will be found in different zones. Look at the marginalia of
     the source map to find the proper UTM zone.

     This program has received only cursory testing. It should be
     used with some caution.
