NAME
     Dlabel - Tool for creating and placing labels within the
     current window
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dlabel [textcolor] [backcolor] [size] [font]
     Dlabel [option=value] [option=value] ...

DESCRIPTION
     Dlabel allows the user to create and place text labels
     within the current window.  It interactively requests that
     the user type in text, and uses the pointing device (mouse)
     to identify where this text is to be placed within the
     current window.  Options can be stated on the command line.
     If Dlabel is run without specified options, defaults are
     used.  Options are:

     textcolor=color
          Sets the color of the label text to that stated.
          Options are red, orange, green, blue, indigo, violet,
          black, white, gray, brown, indigo, magenta, and yellow.
          If the user states no color, Dlabel will default to the
          use of white lettering.
     backcolor=color
          Sets the color of the label background (a rectangle on
          which the text sits) to that stated.  Color options are
          the same as those for the textcolor.  If the user
          states no color, Dlabel will default to the use of a
          black background.
     size=number
          Sets the label text size to the specified number.
          Sizes are stated in pixels.  Text size defaults to 3
          pixels if unstated by the user.
     font=name
          Sets the font in which text will be drawn to that
          stated.  Options are stated by the GRASS tool
          Dshow.fonts.  Roman type is used by default if none is
          specified by the user.

     Options may be stated on the command line either
     positionally or explicitly (see DINTRO).  If stated
     explicitly, they must be stated in the order specified
     above.

NOTES
     The user can attempt to place a label on a screen location
     outside of the current graphics window, but it will not
     appear when typed anywhere outside of the current graphics
     window.
