NAME
     Dpoints - Tool for graphically creating points in the
     current window
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dpoints [color [size [type [file]]]]
     Dpoints [option=value] [option=value] ...

DESCRIPTION
     Dpoints graphically creates point locations in the current
     map window.  Coordinates are read either from standard input
     or from a file stated by the file option.  Options can be
     stated either positionally or explicitly on the command line
     (see DINTRO[2D]).  Dashes (-) can also be inserted
     positionally on the command line to indicate use of default
     values for specific options.  Options are:

     color=color
          Sets the current color to that stated.  Options are
          red, orange, green, blue, indigo, violet, black, white,
          gray, yellow, brown, and magenta.  The default used
          when no color is specified is white.
     size=number
          Size, in pixels, in which the the icon is to be drawn.
          Default size is 1 pixel.
     type=name
          Icon types available are: "x", "+", "box", and
          "diamond".  If no icon type is specified, an "x" is
          used.
     file=input
          Input is a UNIX file name.  Default, if unspecified, is
          standard input.  The file contents should consist of a
          series of grid coordinates that fit within the current
          map window (refer to Dstatus for map window
          coordinates).  These coordinates should be in the form
          of eastings and northings (in that order), separated by
          a single blank space.

NOTES
     Dpoints will locate a point at the location specified, even
     if it is outside the current window.
     Note that output from the GRASS Gsites command can be
     redirected directly into Dpoints.
