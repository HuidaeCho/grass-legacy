NAME
     Gcopy - Copy data files
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gcopy element old new

DESCRIPTION
     Gcopy allows the user to make copies of data files.  The
     data files may reside in any mapset and will be copied to
     the current mapset.  The user specifies which type of data
     file (i.e., the data element) is to be copied, from choices
     listed along the left side of the following list.


          cell          (cell files)

          vect          (vector files)

          icon          (paint icon files)

          labels        (paint labels)

          sites         (site list files)

          window        (window files)

          group         (imagery group files)


     The user specifies the old file to be copied.  This file may
     reside in any mapset.  The user also specifies the name of a
     new file in the current mapset into which the file will be
     copied.

NOTE
     If a data element file has support files (e.g., cell files),
     these support files also are copied.
