          vect          (vector maps)

          icon          (paint icon files)

          labels        (paint labels)

          sites         (site maps)

          window        (window files)

          group         (imagery group files)


     In addition to choosing the element, the user specifies both
     old_name (i.e., the to be renamed) and new_name (the name of
     a new in the current mapset which will hold the renamed

     The old old_name is then renamed to new_name.
