NAME
     Gstats - Prints area statistics for cell
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gstats [-crvz] layer1 [layer2] ...

DESCRIPTION
     Gstats prints area statistics for user-specified The name(s)
     MUST be supplied on the command line. The output can be
     saved by redirecting it into a file.

     If a single is specified, a list of areas in square meters
     (assuming the is in meters) for each category in the will be
     printed.  (If the -c option is choosen, areas will be stated
     in number of cells.) If multiple are specified, a cross
     tabulation table of areas for each combination of categories
     in the will be printed.

     For example, if one is specified, the output would look
     like:

          1:1350000.00
          2:4940000.00
          3:8870000.00

     If 3 a, b, and c, are specified, the output would look like:

          0:0:0:8027500.00
          1:0:0:164227500.00
          2:0:0:31277500.00
          3:0:0:17140000.00
          1:0:1:2177500.00
          2:0:1:2490000.00
          0:1:0:1152500.00
          1:1:0:140092500.00
          2:1:0:24207500.00
          3:1:0:11270000.00
          1:1:1:3355000.00
          2:1:1:1752500.00
          3:1:1:2500.00

     Within each grouping, the first field is the category of a,
     the second is for b, the third is for c, and the last is the
     area in square meters for the particular combination.  For
     example, the combination 3,1,1 covered 2500 square meters.
     Fields are separated by colons.

NOTES
     Gstats works in the current with the current mask.

     If a nicely formatted output is desired, pipe the output

     into a command which can create columnar output. For
     example, the command:

         Gstats a b c | pr -3 | cat -s

     will create a 3-column output

     1:4:4:10000.00          2:1:5:290000.00         2:4:5:2090000.00
     1:4:5:1340000.00        2:2:5:350000.00         3:1:2:450000.00
     2:1:1:1090000.00        2:4:1:700000.00         3:1:3:5280000.00
     2:1:3:410000.00         2:4:3:10000.00          3:1:5:3140000.00

     Also, the output in the examples given happens to be in
     sorted order, but the output from Gstats on more than one is
     not guaranteed to be in any particular order.  If the user
     desires sorted output, use the unix sort(1) command.  For
     example:

         Gstats a b c | sort -t: -0n


OPTIONS
     -c   Prints total cell counts instead of area measurements.

     -r   Raw data. The data for each cell in the current will be
          output, one cell per line, rather than totals for each
          distinct combination. If -R is specified, the row:col
          will be prepended to each output line.

     -v   Non-verbose. Supresses percent complete messages.

     -z   Non-zero only.  Zero data will not be output. For
          multiple this means zero in every will not be outpout.
          Non-zero in any will be output.
