NAME
     Doverlay - Tool for viewing an overlay of grid cell maps
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Doverlay cell_file

DESCRIPTION
     Doverlay overlays the grid cell map cell_file over whatever
     is already displayed in the current window.  cell_file is
     the name of an available cell file in the user's mapset.
     Only grid cells containing non-zero categories will be
     displayed from the overlaid map.  All other areas (i.e.,
     those containing category 0) will leave the underlying
     display untouched.

NOTES
     Doverlay works best when the color look-up table for the
     graphics monitor is set in Dcolormode fixed (see the GRASS
     tool Dcolormode).
