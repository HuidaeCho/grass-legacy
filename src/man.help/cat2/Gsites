     as pairs of coordinates in the form of eastings and
     northings (in that order) that are separated by a single
     blank space.

     -f   This option can be used to print a site description to
          the right of each pair of site coordinates.

     -w   Ignore the current and print all the sites. If -w is
          not specified, only the sites in the current are
          printed.

     redirected directly into Dpoints. In this case, the -w
