NAME
     Mrot90 - Rotates elevation data extracted by either
     Mdted.extract or MdmaUSGSread
     (Map Development Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Mrot90 if=inputfile of=outputfile rows=# cols=# bpc=#

DESCRIPTION
     Mrot90 is used as a companion program to the DTED and DEM
     tape extraction programs Mdted.extract and MdmaUSGSread.
     Mrot90 rotates the contents of the output files generated by
     these tape extraction programs 90 degrees.  Rotation is
     necessary to compensate for the orientation of the data read
     from tape.  This program can be used in conjunction with the
     program Mimport.ll to convert this rotated data into GRASS
     form.

     Mrot90 requires five inputs to be entered by the user:

     if      the full pathname of an already-existing file
             containing the data to be rotated.  This input file
             is usually the output file created by Mdted.extract
             or MdmaUSGSread.

     of      The full pathname of the output file in which the
             rotated data is to be stored.

     rows    The number of rows of data in the input file.

     cols    The number of columns of data in the input file.

     bpc     The number of bytes per column in the input file.

EXAMPLE
     The following command:

     Mrot90    if=/tmp/dma.out  of=/tmp/rot.out  rows=301
               cols=358  bpc=2

     will rotate the file /tmp/dma.out, and place the rotated
     file in /tmp/rot.out. Here, the input file is 301 rows by
     358 columns, at 2 bytes per data value.

NOTE
     The user should note that since the output file is rotated
     90 degrees from the original input file, the rows and
     columns have been interchanged.  Hence in the above example,
     the number of rows (301) and columns (358) stated by the
     user on the command line were those present in the input
     file.  The output file, however, will have 358 rows and 301
     columns.
