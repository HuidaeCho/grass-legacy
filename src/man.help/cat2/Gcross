NAME
     Gcross - Creates a cross product of multiple cell files
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gcross [-vz] layer1 layer2 ... result

DESCRIPTION
     Gcross creates a result layer representing all unique
     comnbinations of values in the input layers. At least two
     input layers must be specified.  The maximum number of input
     layers is 10.

     For example, suppose that, using 2 data layers, the
     following combinations occur:

          layer1   layer2
          _______________
            0        1
            0        2
            1        1
            1        2
            2        4

     Gcross would result in a new data layer with 5 categories:

          layer1   layer2   result
          ________________________
            0        1        1
            0        2        2
            1        1        3
            1        2        4
            2        4        5

     Note: the actual catagory assigned to a particular
     combination is dependent on the order that the combinations
     occur in the data and can be considered essentially random.
     The example given here is for illustrative purposes.

OPTIONS
     -v   Non-verbose. Supresses percent complete messages.

     -z   Non-zero data only. This means that if zero occurs in
          any data layer, the combination is assigned the zero
          category, even if other data layers contain non-zero
          data.  In the example given above, -z would only
          generate 3 categories instead of 5.

          If -z is not specified, then combinations which are not
          all zero will get assigned a unique category.

SUPPORT FILES
     The category file created for the result layer describes the
     combinations which generated each category. In the above
     example, the category labels would be

          cat   label
          _________________________
           1    layer1(0) layer2(1)
           2    layer1(0) layer2(2)
           3    layer1(1) layer2(1)
           4    layer1(1) layer2(2)
           5    layer1(2) layer2(4)

     A random color table is also generated for the result layer.
