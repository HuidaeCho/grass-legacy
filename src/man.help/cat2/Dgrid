NAME
     Dgrid - Tool for overlaying a grid on a map
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dgrid [size [color]]
     Dgrid [option=value] [option=value]

DESCRIPTION
     Dgrid draws a grid in the current graphics window.  The user
     can specify grid size and color, either explicitly or
     positionally (see DINTRO). If grid size and color arguments
     are stated explicitly, their order on the command line is
     immaterial.  The commands

          Dgrid color=magenta size=1000
          and
          Dgrid size=1000 color=magenta

     will therefore produce the same grid.  However, if arguments
     are stated positionally, grid size must be stated before
     color (i.e., Dgrid 1000 magenta ). If the user specifies
     only one option (either size or color), the unspecified
     option becomes the default value.

     size=size
          Size of grid to be drawn.  If the user does not specify
          a grid size, a 10,000 meter grid will be drawn by
          default in the current graphics window.  It should be
          noted that, depending on the scale of the map layer
          displayed in this window, this 10,000 meter grid may
          fall outside the user's viewing range.
     color=color
          Sets the current grid color.  Options are red, orange,
          green, blue, yellow, indigo, violet, black, white,
          gray, brown, and magenta.  The default color is white.

     Dgrid will not erase grids already created using Dgrid;
     multiple invocations of Dgrid will therefore result in the
     drawing of multiple grids inside the current graphics
     window.

LIMITATIONS
     Currently, the grid size can only be drawn in the map's
     current coordinate system.
