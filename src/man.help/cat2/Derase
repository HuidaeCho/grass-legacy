Derase(2D)           GRASS Reference Manual            Derase(2D)



NAME
     Derase - Clears the contents of the currently chosen
     graphics window
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Derase [color]

DESCRIPTION
     Derase erases the contents of the current graphics window,
     and replaces it with the color black (by default) or by the
     stated color.  Color options are red, orange, yellow, green,
     blue, yellow, indigo, violet, black, white, gray, brown, and
     magenta.  Derase does not remove the current window.  It
     only erases the contents of the current window.  Because
     Derase replaces the contents of the current window with a
     color, it will obscure those portions of any windows which
     overlap the current window with that color.  Derase will not
     alter the assignment of the current window.

NOTES
     Derase will complain if no window has been chosen to be the
     current window with Dchoose.
