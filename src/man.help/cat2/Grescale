NAME
     Grescale - Rescales the in a
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Grescale  old_layer new_layer old_min old_max new_min
               new_max [title]

DESCRIPTION
     Grescale creates a new that is a rescaling of an existing
     This command is useful for producing representations with a
     reduced number of categories from a with a large range of
     category values (e.g., an elevation Rescaled are appropriate
     for use in such programs as cell.stats(1), report(1), and
     coin(1).

     The user specifies the name of the to be rescaled
     (old_layer) and the resulting name (new_layer). The user
     also specifes the minimum (old_min) and maximum (old_max)
     range of the to be rescaled, as well as the desired minimum
     (new_min) and maximum (new_max) output range of the
     resultant rescaled These ranges determine the scaling to be
     performed.  An optional title may also be specified for the
     new

     which falls outside of the specified input range of the to
     be rescaled will become zero.  This allows the user to
     select a subset of the full range for rescaling.  The user
     should know the range of the input before invoking Grescale.
     This can be determined by using either the GRASS describe or
     Gdescribe commands.

     An appropriate category file and color table, based upon the
     original are generated with category labels that reflect the
     original used to produce each category.


EXAMPLE
     If you want to rescale an elevation with ranging from 1090
     meters to 1800 meters into the range 1-255, the following
     command line could be used:


          Grescale elevation elevation.255 1090 1800 1 255

NOTES
     The rescaled range is actually unlimited, but the range 1 to
     255 is used frequently due to limitations of

     Grescale actually runs Greclass to represent the rescaled
     categories.
