NAME
     Gweight - Weighted overlay analysis tool
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gweight [output] [action] [color]
     Gweight [output=option] [action=option] [color=option]


DESCRIPTION
     Gweight is the non-interactive version of weight.  Both
     programs allow the user to assign numeric values (i.e.,
     "weights") to individual within These weights are then
     distributed locationally throughout a based on the
     distribution of the categories with which they are
     associated.  The user can weight the categories of several
     in a Such weighted can then be overlain.  Gweight will
     combine weights in the overlain by cell A resulting output
     depicts the combination of weights across a landscape.
     These values represent a hierarchy of suitability for some
     user-defined purpose.  To obtain a more detailed
     description, see the manual entry for weight[1].

     Output cell map must be specified                       (no default)
     Action must be either (add or mult)                     (default: add)
     Color table for the new cell map (grey | wave | ramp)   (default: grey)

     Once the Gweight command line is entered, the user will need
     to enter a name and assign numeric values to its categories.
     Values can be assigned to the categories of up to six within
     Gweight in a single analysis.  Help is available to the user
     by typing Gweight help.

EXAMPLE
     The following is the format in which data should be entered
     to Gweight:
          Cell_layer1
          [Reclass rule 1a]
          [Reclass rule 1b]
          Cell_layer2
          [Reclass rule 2a]
          etc.
          end
     Cell_layer:  cell_map OR "cell_map in mapset"
     Reclass rule: (example)  1 = 5 OR 20 thru 50 = 10 (must leave spaces between
       the category, =, and value entries)

     Example: (the prompts are shown in bold)
          >  Gweight sites add wave
          >  soils

               soils>  1 thru 20 = 5

               soils>  21 thru 30 = 10
               soils>  landcover

               landcover>  1 = 2
               landcover>  2 = 4
               landcover>  3 thru 8 = 6
               landcover>  end


NOTES
     The user must be knowledgeable about weight to run Gweight.
     Gweight does not provide the user with a listing of or
     categories.  Users unsure about cell map names should run
     the GRASS tool Glist.  To obtain a listing of the categories
     for a run Greport.

     The user can create an input file containing the data needed
     to run Gweight.  This file must list the cell and reclass
     rules in the format shown in the above example.  The prompts
     must not be included in the file.  This file can be directed
     into Gweight at the command line by typing Gweight output
     action color <  input_file

BUGS
     When entering data for the reclass rules, if the user does
     not include spaces between the category, =, and value, the
     program will assume that the entry is a cell
