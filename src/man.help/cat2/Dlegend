NAME
     Dlegend - Tool for displaying a map legend in the current
     window
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dlegend name [color]
     Dlegend [option=value] [option=value]

DESCRIPTION
     Dlegend displays a legend for the grid cell map mapname in
     the current graphics window.  The legend is displayed along
     the left edge of the current window, at a scale based on the
     vertical height of this window.  All categories in the map
     are squeezed into the current window.  The user should
     therefore take care to create a window of suitable
     dimensions.  Portions of the map underlying the legend will
     be overwritten.  Options are name and color:

     name=mapname
          Name of the grid cell map to be displayed by Dlegend.
     color=color
          Sets the legend color to that stated.  Options are red,
          orange, green, blue, indigo, violet, black, white,
          gray, yellow, brown, and magenta.  The legend is drawn
          in white by default if the user does not specify a
          color.

     If options are stated explicitly, the order in which they
     are stated is immaterial.  However, if options are stated
     positionally, map name must be stated before color on the
     command line (see DINTRO).
