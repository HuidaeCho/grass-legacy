NAME
     Gcovar - Prints covariance matrix for cell files
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gcovar layer1 [layer2] ...

DESCRIPTION
     Gcovar prints a covariance matrix for user-specified grid
     cell data layers.  The layer name(s) MUST be supplied on the
     command line. The output can be saved by redirecting it into
     a file.

     The output is an N x N symmetric covariance matrix, where N
     is the number of cell files specified on the command line,
     e.g.,

          Gcovar layer.1 layer.2 layer.3

     would produce a 3x3 matrix (values are example only):

          462.876649   480.411218   281.758307
          480.411218   513.015646   278.914813
          281.758307   278.914813   336.326645


PRINCIPLE COMPONENTS
     This module can be used as the first step of a principle
     components transformation.  The covariance matrix would be
     input into a system which determines eigen values and eigen
     vectors. An NxN covariance matrix would result in N real
     eigen values and N eigen vectors (each composed of N real
     numbers). In the above example, the eigen values and
     corresponding eigen vectors for the covariance matrix are:

  component   eigen value                 eigen vector
      1       1159.745202   <   0.691002    0.720528    0.480511   >
      2          5.970541   <   0.711939   -0.635820   -0.070394   >
      3        146.503197   <   0.226584    0.347470   -0.846873   >

     The component corresponding to each vector can be produced
     using Gmapcalc as follows:

     Gmapcalc 'pc.1 = 0.691002*layer.1 + 0.720528*layer.2 + 0.480511*layer.3'
     Gmapcalc 'pc.2 = 0.711939*layer.1 - 0.635820*layer.2 - 0.070394*layer.3'
     Gmapcalc 'pc.3 = 0.226584*layer.1 + 0.347470*layer.1 - 0.846873*layer.3'

     Note that based on the relative sizes of the eigen values,
     pc.1 will contain about 88% of the variance in the data set,
     pc.2 will contain about 1% of the variance in the data set,
     and pc.3 will contain about 11% of the variance in the data
     set.

     Also, note that the range of values produced in pc.1, pc.2,
     and pc.3 will not (in general) be the same as those for
     layer.1, layer.2, and layer.3.  It may be necessary to
     rescale pc.1, pc.2 and pc.3 to the desired range (e.g. 0-
     255).  This can be done with rescale or Grescale.

NOTES
     Code to produce eigen vectors is currently under
     development. If your system has a fortran compiler, then the
     program eigensystem can be compiled and used to generate the
     eigen values and vectors.
