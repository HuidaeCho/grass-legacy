NAME
     Gdescribe - Generates terse listing of values found in cell
     files
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gdescribe [-1rvw] layer

DESCRIPTION
     Gdescribe examines a user-chosen grid cell data layer. The
     layer MUST be supplied on the command line.

     A compact list of category values that were found in the
     data layer will be printed.

     Following is a sample output:

          0 2-4 10-13

OPTIONS
     -1   Print the output one value per line, instead of the
          default short form.  In the above example, the -1
          option would output:

               0
               2
               3
               4
               10
               11
               12
               13


     -r   Only print the range of the data.  The highest and
          lowest positive values, and the highest and lowest
          negative values are output. In the above example, the
          -r option would output:

               0 2 13

          If the -1 option is also specified, the output is one
          per line.

     -v   Non-verbose. The -v option will tell Gdescribe to be
          silent while reading the cell file. If not specified,
          it prints percentage completed messages.

     -w   Use the current window. Normally, Gdescribe will read
          the data layer directly, ignoring both the current
          window and mask. The -w option tells Gdescribe to read
          the data layer in the current window masked by the
