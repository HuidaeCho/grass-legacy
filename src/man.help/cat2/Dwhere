NAME
     Dwhere - To locate points on a map.
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dwhere [spheroid] [mode]
     Dwhere [option=value] [option=value]

DESCRIPTION
     Dwhere is an interactive tool which allows the user, using
     the pointing device (mouse), to identify locations on the
     map in the current graphics window.

     If the user runs Dwhere without options, each mouse click
     will output the UTM easting and northing of the point
     currently beneath the mouse pointer.  A button menu is
     presented so the user knows which mouse buttons to use. The
     output is always printed to the screen.  If the output is
     redirected into a file, it will be written to the file as
     well.

     If Dwhere is run with the s=spheroid option, latitude and
     longitude values will also be printed. The user must specify
     a valid spheroid.  To find out what spheroids Dwhere knows
     about, type Dwhere help.  Currently, valid spheroid options
     include: australian, clark80, wgs72, bessel, everest,
     clark66, and international.

     If run with the m=quiet option, only one mouse click is
     executed.  This option is provided for shell scripts and
     programs which want to obtain only one point from the user.
     The output is only written to stdout, unless redirected into
     a file.  The default, if unspecified, is to run in a mode
     with the quiet off.
