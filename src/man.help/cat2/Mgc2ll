NAME
     Mgc2ll - Converts geocentric to geographic coordinates
     (Map Development Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Mgc2ll x=# y=# z=# s=spheroid

DESCRIPTION
     Mgc2ll returns geographic coordinates for geocentric ones
     supplied by the user.  It is the reverse of the GRASS
     program Mll2gc. The x, y and z values are the three
     dimensions needed to locate a point in three-dimensional
     space.  The values that are printed include the latitude,
     the longitude and the height above (or distance below) the
     spheroid.

     The list of spheroids available is somewhat dynamic. It may
     not contain exactly the ones listed below. To determine the
     current list of possible spheroids, simply type in:

          Mgc2ll x=0 y=0 z=0 s=help

     A list of available spheroids will be printed on the screen.
     If the spheroid desired is not on the list, the values for
     the semi-major axis and the eccentricity squared for the
     spheroid may be entered in place of a spheroid name in the
     following format:

          s=a=semi-major_axis,e=eccentricity_squared

     SOME POSSIBLE SPHEROIDS
     (The on-line listing includes only the spheroid names)

NOTES
     For a brief discussion of spheroids see Mll2u.

     For a brief discussion of geocentric coordinates see Mll2gc.

     This is an experimental program. It is part of an initial
     effort to incorporate geographic coordinates into GRASS.
