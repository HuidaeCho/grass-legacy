NAME
     Greclass - Create new cell based on existing cell
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Greclass input_layer output_layer [title]

DESCRIPTION
     Greclass allows a user to create an output based on an input
     This output will be a reclassification of the input based on
     reclass rules input to Greclass. A title for the output may
     be (optionally) specified on the command line.  The reclass
     rules are read from standard input (i.e., from the keyboard,
     redirected from a file, or piped through another program).

RECLASS RULES
     Once the user has specified an input output and (optionally)
     output title by typing
     Greclass input_layer output_layer title
     each line of input must have the following format:

          input_categories = output_category  [label]

     where list specifies the in the input to be reclassified to
     the new Specification of a label to be associated with the
     new output category is optional. If specified it is recorded
     as the category label for the new The equal sign = is
     required. The input_category(ies) may consist of single
     category or a range of in the format "low thru high." The
     word "thru" must be present.

     A line containing only the word end terminates the input.

EXAMPLES
     The following examples may help clarify the reclass rules.


     1  This example reclassifies categories 1, 3 and 5 in the
        input to category 1 with category label "poor quality" in
        the output and reclassifies input categories 2, 4, and 6
        to category 2 with the label "good quality" in the output

             1 3 5   =   1   poor quality
             2 4 6   =   2   good quality


     2  This example reclassifies input categories 1 thru 10 to
        output category 1, input categories 11 thru 20 to output
        category 2, and input categories 21 thru 30 to output
        category 3, all without labels.

              1 thru 10   =   1

             11 thru 20   =   2
             21 thru 30   =   3


     3  Subsequent rules override previous rules.  Therefore, the
        below example reclassifies input categories 1 thru 19 and
        51 thru 100 to category 1 in the output input categories
        20 thru 24 and 26 thru 50 to the output category 2, and
        input category 25 to the output category 3.

             1 thru 100   =   1   poor quality
             20 thru 50   =   2   medium quality
                 25       =   3   good quality


     4  The previous example could also have been entered as:

              1 thru 19  51 thru 100   =   1   poor quality
             20 thru 24  26 thru 50    =   2   medium quality
                       25              =   3   good quality

        or as:

              1 thru 19    =   1   poor quality
             51 thru 100   =   1
             20 thru 24    =   2
             26 thru 50    =   2   medium quality
                 25        =   3   good quality


     The final example was given to show how the labels are
     handled. If a new appears in more than one rule (as is the
     case with new 1 and 2) the last label which was specified
     becomes the label for that category.  In this case the
     labels are assigned exactly as in the two previous examples.

BEWARE
     A reclass file is not a true cell Rather, it is a table of
     reclassification values which reference the input cell (see
     manual entry reclass[1] for a detailed description of
     reclass files).  Therefore, users who wish to retain
     reclassified must also save the original input from which
     they were generated.

     which are not explicitly reclassified will be reclassified
     to 0.

NOTES
     To convert a reclass file to a regular cell set your to
     match the header for the reclass file and then run resample.
