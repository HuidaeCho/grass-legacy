NAME
     Vpatch - Create a new vector map by combining other
     (Mapdev tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Vpatch file1 file2 ... composite_mapname

DESCRIPTION
     Vpatch allows the user to combine any number of vector maps
     together to create one composite The user must provide the
     name of two or more vector maps to be combined, and the name
     of the new composite

COMMENTS
     The to be patched must exist in the current mapset, and the
     composite must not previously exist.

     After running Vpatch the header file will contain mostly
     information from file1. The will be expanded to encompass
     all and the scale will be the largest of all patched (this
     will affect default snapping thresholds).  The header will
     probably need to be edited;  this can be done from within
     the GRASS program digit.

     Any that are duplicated between (e.g., border lines) will
     have to be edited or removed.

     After running Vpatch you will have to run support.vect on
     the composite in order to create the dig_plus file.  At this
     time, you can ask for a very small snapping threshold (1-5
     meters) to cause nodes that match up across to snap
     together, without affecting the integrity of the remainder
     of the
