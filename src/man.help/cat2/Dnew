NAME
     Dnew - To create new windows on the monitor
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dnew
     Dnew [option=value] [option=value] ...

DESCRIPTION
     Dnew creates new graphics windows on the graphics monitor.
     Options are

     name=name
          Name to be assigned to newly created window.  If the
          user provides no name, Dnew will generate a unique
          name.
     top=number
          Sets the vertical coordinate of the top of the window
          to the specified number.
     bottom=number
          Sets the vertical coordinate of the bottom of the
          window to the specified number.
     left=number
          Sets the horizontal coordinate of the left of the
          window to the specified number.
     right=number
          Sets the horizontal coordinate of the right of the
          window to the specified number.

     Coordinates use a percentage scale; values are in the range
     0-100 with the coordinate 0,0 being the lower left corner of
     the screen.

     Dnew runs interactively if window coordinates are not
     provided on the command line.  It uses the pointing device
     (mouse) to construct the new window, and returns the name of
     the new window upon completion (usually a number).  Dnew can
     be used to create multiple windows on the monitor;  these
     windows can overlap.  Note, however, that Dnew will not
     choose a window for display of graphics (see Dchoose[2D]).

     Dnew exits with the name of the new window.  A unique name
     is also given to the window if not specified on the command
     line.
