NAME
     Gdumpcell - Converts a cell file into an ascii text file
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gdumpcell [-#] layer

DESCRIPTION
     Gdumpcell allows the user to convert a map layer into an
     ascii text file suitable for export into other computer
     systems.  The -# option (where # is a number of the user's
     choice) can be used to request that numbers in the ouput be
     equally-spaced (i.e., columnar output).  Each category
     number in the ascii map layer will then take up # number of
     spaces.  However, to use this, the user should know the
     maximum number of digits that will occur in the output file,
     and add one to this number (to leave a space between each
     column).  The user can find the maximum number of digits
     occuring in the output file by running Gdumpcell without the
     -# option.

NOTES
     The output from Gdumpcell may be placed into a file by using
     the UNIX redirection mechanism.  For example:

                     Gdumpcell layer > file

     The output file can then be printed or copied onto a
     magnetic tape or floppy disk for export purposes.
