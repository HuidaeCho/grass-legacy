NAME
     Gfilename  - Print database file names
     (G Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Gfilename element mapset name

DESCRIPTION
     Gfilename is designed for Bourne shell scripts that need to
     know the full unix file name for cell files, vector files,
     site list files, window files, imagery group files, etc., in
     the database.


     element
          The database element (i.e., directory within the GRASS
          mapset location).

     mapset
          The database mapset of the file.  As a convenience, a
          single dot (.) can be used for the current mapset.

     name The name of the data file.

OUTPUT
     Gfilename writes one line to standard output:

          file=[filename]

     The output is a /bin/sh command to set the variable file to
     the full UNIX name for the database file.  This variable may
     be set in the /bin/sh as follows:

          eval `Gfilename element mapset name`

NOTES
     This routine generates the filename, but does not care if
     the file exists or not. This feature allows shell scripts to
     create new database files as well as use existing ones.

     If the mapset is the current mapset, Gfindfile automatically
     creates the element if it doesn't already exist.  This makes
     it easy to add new files to the database without having to
     worry about the existence of the required database
     directories.

     The program exits with 0 if everything is ok; non-zero if
     there is an error, in which case file=[filename] is not
     output.
