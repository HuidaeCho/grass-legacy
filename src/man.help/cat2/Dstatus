NAME
     Dstatus - Prints the status of monitor windows
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dstatus

DESCRIPTION
     Dstatus prints to standard output information about the
     windows on the monitor.  This information includes:
          The time (number) of creation of the current window
          (time)
          Current window name (cur_w)
          Monitor window names (WINDOW)
          Map window coordinates associated with monitor windows
          (m_win)
          Display window coordinates associated with monitor
          windows (d_win) (display window coordinates assume
          (0,0) is located in the upper left corner of the
          monitor)
          The list of commands used to create the contents of
          monitor windows (i.e., Dcell: soils in PERMANENT, Dgrid
          100, etc.)
          The times (numbers) of creation of all monitor windows
          (from most recently created, to earliest created)
          (time)

NOTES
     This command is generally used for program debugging, and is
     not needed by the casual user.  Dstatus will complain if no
     graphics monitor has been selected for output.
     If the user performs an action in a window that overwrites
     information already there (i.e., the user runs Dcell after
     having run Dgrid), the overwritten information will be lost
     in the Dstatus file as well.
