NAME
     Dcell - Tool for viewing maps
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dcell mapname [overlay=1/0]

DESCRIPTION
     Dcell displays the grid cell map mapname in the current
     graphics window, where mapname is the name of an available
     cell file in the user's mapset search path.  If the
     currently chosen window already contains text or graphics,
     it is wise to first invoke Derase to clear the current
     window before running Dcell. After running Dcell, other D
     programs such as Dvect and Dgrid can be used to enhance the
     plot.

     If run without the overlay=1 option, Dcell overwrites any
     image already in the current window (also obscuring those
     portions of any windows which overlap the current window).

     If the option overlay=1 is used, those portions of the image
     already in the current window which contain category 0 are
     left untouched.  The Doverlay command is simply the running
     of Dcell with this option set.

     The default is to set overlay=0, which will cause Dcell to
     completely overwrite whatever is in the current window.
