Dsplit(2D)           GRASS Reference Manual            Dsplit(2D)



NAME
     Dsplit - Divides the monitor into two windows and then
     displays two maps
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dsplit mapname1 mapname2 [cmd=GRASS command][cmd2=GRASS
     command] [view=horiz]

DESCRIPTION
     Dsplit is a UNIX Bourne shell macro which clears the entire
     screen and divides it into two windows.  Maps are then
     displayed in each of the two windows.  This command is very
     useful for visually comparing maps (cell, vector, 3D views)
     and can be used by other GRASS shell macros.  It is also
     useful for creating demos.

Options:
     view=horiz  The screen can be split either horizontally or
                 vertically.  The default view splits the screen
                 into two screens, one on the left and one on the
                 right (vertical split).  Some maps ( 3D views)
                 are better represented with more width then
                 height (horizontal split).  The first map name
                 listed on the command line will be displayed in
                 the top or left window, depending on whether the
                 screen was split, horizontally or vertically.
                 The second map will be displayed in the bottom
                 or right window.

     cmd=        The default command that displays the map is
                 Dcell, but it can be changed to any GRASS
                 command (D3d, Dvect, etc...).

     cmd2=       This command will be executed for the second
                 window only.

                 The way the commands (cmd=, cmd2=) work are if
                 no commands are given on the command line then
                 the default command (Dcell) is executed for both
                 windows.  If only cmd= is listed on the command
                 line then that command will be executed for both
                 windows.  If both cmd= and cmd2= are on the
                 command line then the (cmd=) command is executed
                 in window 1 and the (cmd2=) command is executed
                 in window 2.

                 Example: Dsplit soils vegcover

                 Example: Dsplit soils cmd2=Dlegend "soils red"

                 Example: Dsplit cmd=D3d elevation vegcover

Notes
          Dsplit leaves the window that the last map was drawn in
          as the active window.  The order in which the options (
          cmd=, cmd2=, view=) are placed on the command line
          doesn't matter, but the order is important for the map
          names.
