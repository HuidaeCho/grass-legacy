NAME
     Dwhich - Identify window by screen location
     (D Language Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Dwhich [horizontal] [vertical]
     Dwhich [option=value] [option=value]

DESCRIPTION
     Dwhich determines which available graphics window
     accomodates the given screen coordinate.  On exit it prints
     the graphics window name.  Options are:

     horizontal=number
          Where number is the X, or horizontal screen coordinate.
     vertical=number
          Where number is the Y, or vertical screen coordinate.

     The coordinates are percentage values (within the range of
     0-99), with the coordinates 0,0 representing the lower left
     corner of the screen.

BUGS
     A coordinate location falling inside two or more overlapping
     windows will arbitrarily select the window whose right side
     is closest to that coordinate location.  Care must be taken
     with overlapping windows, as the results will be undefined.
