NAME
     GRASS - Geographic Resources Analysis Support System
     (GRASS-GRID Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     GRASS3 or grass3

DESCRIPTION
     The commands GRASS3 and grass3 prepare and make available
     the set of Geographical Resources Analysis Support System -
     Grid Cell Analysis (GRASS-GRID) analysis tools developed by
     the Environmental Division of USA-CERL.  The command grass3
     invokes the user-friendly version of GRASS;  it is intended
     to be used by new and occasional GRASS users.   The command
     GRASS3 invokes the quick-access version of GRASS, which is
     more comfortable for those who are frequent users of the
     GRASS Geographic Information System (GIS).

     Any GRASS session will consist of three parts.

     1) ENTRY
          This is a set-up screen where session information
          on the current MAPSET and LOCATION is set. See the
          section "ENTRY SCREEN" below.
     2) COMMANDS
          GRASS commands are entered in order to display
          graphics, perform analyses, etc.
     3) EXIT
          An option is given to remove extraneous map layers from
          the mapset. Then the user exits from GRASS.

     Steps 1 and 3 are identical regardless of whether a user is
     working under grass3 or GRASS3. Step 2 will differ based on
     whether a user is using grass3 or GRASS3.  Under grass3, the
     user is presented with series of hierarchical menus from
     which to select commands.  Under GRASS3 the user enters
     command names directly;  little help is available.  Certain
     commands are only accessible when running under GRASS3.

     Note that it is not possible to go directly from step 2 back
     to step 1.  In order to make changes to the set-up
     information (i.e., MAPSET, LOCATION, and DATABASE) the user
     must exit from GRASS and then re-enter.

ENTRY SCREEN
     After entering either the command grass3 or GRASS3, the user
     is first presented with a page of prompts in a "visual-ask"
     question-answer format.  "Visual" refers to the fact that
     several questions are presented at once; the user has the
     opportunity to answer these prompts in whatever order is
     desired.  When satisfied with all answers, the user asks the
     program to continue. This type of screen appears fairly

     commonly within GRASS. See the section entitled "VISUAL-ASK
     SCREENS" below for more information about them.

     The user's first interaction with GRASS looks like this:

                        PLEASE SET SESSION INFORMATION

      LOCATION:   This is the name of an available geographic location.
                  -spearfish- is the sample database for which all
                  tutorials are written.

      MAPSET:     Every GRASS session runs under the name of a MAPSET.
                  Associated with each MAPSET is a rectangular
                  COORDINATE WINDOW and a list of any new maps created.

      DATABASE:   This is the UNIX directory containing the
                  geographic databases.
                  It need not be exactly the same
                  as specified in the above example.

          The WINDOW defaults to the entire area of the chosen LOCATION.
          You may change it later with the command: window
     ____________________________________________________________________

      LOCATION:   spearfish_____    (enter list for a list of locations)
      MAPSET:     login-name____    (or mapsets within a location)

     The user is asked to identify the following:


     LOCATION:
              This is the name of the area of interest for this
              session. The LOCATION "spearfish" is already in
              place when GRASS is installed.  Other LOCATIONs are
              created and map layers are added into them at the
              user's discretion. See the subsection "Creating a
              new LOCATION" for instructions on starting this
              process.

     MAPSET:  This is a name for the particular set of map layers
              the user will be working with. Mapsets carry over
              from one GRASS session to another whether left for
              days or weeks.  A mapset may be removed at the
              user's request at the end of a session.  See the



GRASS 3.2                U.S. Army CERL                         2






GRASS(1)             GRASS Reference Manual              GRASS(1)



              subsection "Creating a new MAPSET" for more
              information on mapsets.

     DATABASE:
              This is the UNIX directory in which all the
              database LOCATIONS reside.

Creating a new MAPSET
     The MAPSET "PERMANENT" is created at the same time a new
     LOCATION is created. This is where the "permanent" map
     layers should reside, offering "read only" access to all
     users while reserving "writing" privileges to the creator of
     the LOCATION. It is common practice that a user's login name
     be used as a MAPSET name, and this MAPSET is created
     automatically when a user first enters GRASS.  If the user
     should want to make a new MAPSET of a name other than the
     user's login name, the user can simply type in that new
     MAPSET name in the space provided. Suppose the user enters
     newname as the MAPSET name. After the user enters <ESC>,
     GRASS will respond:

     Mapset <<newname>> is not available.
     Would you like to create <newname> as a new mapset? (y/n)

     If the user answers yes, GRASS will then create the MAPSET
     newname, and will then continue to the next screen.

Creating a new LOCATION
     In the event that LOCATION is not one available in this
     GRASS session, the user is given the opportunity to create a
     new LOCATION. Suppose the user enters newplace as LOCATION.
     After hitting the <ESC> key GRASS will respond:

     Location <newplace> is not available.

     Would you like to create location <newplace >? (y/n)

     If yes, then the user is instructed:

          To create a new LOCATION, you will need the following
          information:
          1. The coordinate system for the database
               x,y (for imagery and other unreferenced data)
               UTM
               State Plane
          2. The zone for the database (for other than the x,y
          coordinate system)
          3. The coordinates of the area to become the default
          window and the grid resolution for this window
          4. Do you have all this information for location
          <newplace>? (y/n)

GRASS(1)             GRASS Reference Manual              GRASS(1)



     If the answer is yes, the user continues and is then
     prompted to specify the coordinate system and the zone (if
     applicable), and to identify the area of the default window.
     See the manual entry for the command window[1] for more
     information about specifying the default window.

MENU-DRIVEN VS QUICK-ACCESS VERSIONS OF GRASS
     Once all answers are acceptable, the user is given access to
     the GRASS capabilities.  Access to these capabilities comes
     in two flavors depending on which of the two commands,
     grass3 or GRASS3, was entered by the user.  The command
     grass3 gives the new or occasional GRASS user a friendly,
     menu-driven interactive session, while GRASS3 gives the more
     experienced user rapid and direct access to the GRASS
     capabilities.  The two options are discussed separately
     below.

grass3
     The grass3 command actually runs a program which "crawls" up
     and down a menu tree, executing GRASS commands as requested.
     The menu is completely visually oriented.  The first
     information displayed will look similar to the next diagram.
     This screen provides the user with various pieces of
     information and several options.  Note that the screen has
     been divided into 4 boxed windows.  The top box is reserved
     for a one-line system message which provides the current
     time, the user's terminal device, and directions on what
     kind of response the user should enter.  The second box is
     used to display the structure of the hierarchical menu.  The
     user's current location in the GRASS menu-structure is noted
     by the menu entry that is capitalized in this box.  The
     third window provides the current user with command options
     available at this point in the menu hierarchy.  These
     options are actual grass3 programs and/or sub-menus.
     Finally, the bottom window provides the user with a place in
     which to type the next request.

     Regardless of where the user is in the menu structure,
     several options beyond those listed in window 3 of the

        information about the current options displayed on
        the screen.

        help - Typing "help" will provide access to the on-
        line GRASS help facility and verbose command
        listings.

        back - Typing "back" will cause the user to back up
        one notch in the menu.

        top - Typing "top" will cause the user to move
        immediately to the top of the menu.

        exit - "exit" will always take a user completely out
        of the grass3 menu.

        manual - Typing "manual" will provide access to the
        on-line GRASS reference manual.

     The following commands may also be used:

        cntrl-H   Moves the cursor back one space.

        cntrl-R   Results in the entire screen being
        replotted. Useful in the case of a screen getting
        messed up with line noise.

GRASS3
     Accessing the GRASS capabilities via the command GRASS3
     provides the user with direct access to the individual GRASS
     programs and utilities.  Instead of working one's way
     through several layers in the menu in order to access the
     program display, for example, the user need only enter the
     command display at the prompt.  All programs are accessed
     with the same command names that are used in the menu-access
     version, grass3.

VISUAL-ASK SCREENS
     As mentioned earlier, GRASS commands often use what are
     known as visual-ask screens when receiving input from the
     user while a GRASS command is being run. These screens all
     have certain common characteristics.

     They are set up just like the ENTRY SCREEN (above) in that
     several answer blanks are waiting for input to be typed in
     by the user.  If text is already present in the answer
     blank, the user has the option of accepting the default text
     (by pressing RETURN) and continuing to move around the
     screen without making changes. Note that when the user types
     text into a blank which already contains text, the user's
     new answer will will replace whatever was underlying it.

     The user may move around on the screen from answer blank to
     answer blank indefinitely until finally instructing GRASS to
     continue on to the next screen by hitting the <ESC> key.

     Answers are automatically confined to the answer blanks.
     Letters and numbers can be typed into the blanks.  Several
     other key combinations result in different effects:

        RETURN . This will advance the cursor to the next
        prompt within the same screen.  If the cursor was on
        the bottom-most prompt, hitting the RETURN key will
        advance the cursor to the top-most prompt on that
        screen.  Whatever was typed into the space is
        evaluated.  The accepted answer is then left in the
        prompt.  (Letters typed into a number prompt will be
        read as zeros.)

        cntrl-H . To move the cursor backwards one space at

        <ESC> Once all answers are appropriately completed,
        hit the "escape" key.  The program will then take
        and process those answers.  The next screen will
        then appear.

        cntrl-A .  The entire screen is appended to the file
        "visual_ask" in the user's home directory.  This is
        useful for putting screen images in documents.

        cntrl-R  Results in the entire screen being
        replotted. Useful in the case of a screen getting
        messed up with line noise.

FINISHING A GRASS SESSION
     Whether the user is running the GRASS programs via grass3 or
     GRASS3, it is necessary to type exit to end the current
     GRASS session.  Exiting will always invoke a short "clean-
     up" session.  The user is asked if the mapset should be
     saved or removed.  Because cell map files can be
     exceptionally large, it is best to remove your mapsets
     whenever reasonable.

DIAGNOSTICS
     If the user desires, diagnostic messages written by GRASS
     programs can be logged. If the file GIS_ERROR_LOG exists
     either in the user's home directory or in the GISBASE
     directory, and has write permission to the user, diagnostics
     will also be written to these log files.
