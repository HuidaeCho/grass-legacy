NAME
     prune - Perform pruning on vector

SYNOPSIS
     prune

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS tool prune allows the user to remove extra points
     from a vector This allows one to reduce disk space required
     by a vector and still have data accuracy within a given
     tolerance.
     The user is propted for three items: input vector new output
     vector and threshold at which to prune.  This threshold
     value is the same as the digit[1] pruning threshold.  This
     is specified in units (e.g., in meters for UTM).  The
     threshold can also be specified in inches on the map, and
     the program will convert these to units using the scale in
     the vector To differentiate between the two, you must
     specifiy inches by typing the letter 'i' immediately
     following the threshold value (e.g.,  0.04i).  The input map
     will be read and the resultant pruned map will be placed
     into a newly created output map, leaving the original map
     unchanged.  The pruning algorithm throws away redundant
     points within the specified threshold.  It works on each
     digitized line separately, from node to node.  It does not
     change the position or number of nodes.

NOTES
     This program calls Vprune[2V] .
