NAME
     gisenv - Lists GRASS user variables
     (Available through grass3 menu)

SYNOPSIS
     gisenv [variable_name]

DESCRIPTION
     If run without arguments, gisenv lists the current GRASS
     variables for the user.  Results produced by this command
     may look like this:

          GISDBASE=/usr/grass3/data
          LOCATION_NAME=spearfish
          MAPSET=PERMANENT

     If variable_name is specified, the value for that variable
     is output.

     While there may be other variables associated with each
     session, those stated below are essential.

     GISDBASE - This is the top level directory. All GRASS are
          within this directory. The LOCATION_NAME variable will
          exist along with other possible

     LOCATION_NAME - The name of the currently being accessed by
          GRASS commands.  This will be a directory under the
          directory given by the GISDBASE variable.   Under the
          LOCATION_NAME directory will be one or more MAPSET
          directories.  The directory "PERMANENT" is reserved for
          the set of maps that form the base set for all users.

     MAPSET - Gives the directory name for the set of maps under
          the LOCATION_NAME directory to which the user currently
          has write access.  Any maps created by the user will be
          stored here.

     All of these names must be legal names on the current
     system.  For UNIX users, names less than 14 characters and
     containing no non-printing or space codes are permissible.
     Examples of permissible names include: one, mymap, VeGe_map,
     and 1_for_me.  The underscore character can safely be used
     in place of a blank for multiple word names.

NOTES
     The output from gisenv without arguments is directly usable
     by /bin/sh. The following will cast each variable into the
     UNIX environment:

          eval `gisenv`

     This works only for /bin/sh. The format of the output is not
     compatible with other UNIX shells.
