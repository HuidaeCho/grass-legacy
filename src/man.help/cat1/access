NAME
     access - control access to the current mapset

SYNOPSIS
     access

DESCRIPTION
     This program allows the user to control access to the
     current mapset.  Normally any user can read data from any
     GRASS mapset. But sometimes it is desirable to prohibit
     access to certain sensitive data. The access command allows
     a user to restrict access to the current mapset.

     For example, the user may allow only users in the same UNIX
     group to read data files in the mapset. Or the user may
     restrict the mapset to personal use only.

     The user will be presented with a screen page which reflects
     the current mapset permissions. The user can then change
     them. The screen page looks like:
     __________________________________________________________________________________
    | LOCATION: spearfish                                                 MAPSET: demo|
    |                                                                                 |
    | This program allows you to control access to your mapset by other users.        |
    | Access may be granted/removed for everyone, or for everyone in your group.      |
    |                                                                                 |
    | Mark an 'x' to allow access, erase the field to restrict access.                |
    |                                                                                 |
    |                                                                                 |
    |     GROUP: _x_                                                                  |
    |     OTHER: _x_                                                                  |
    |                                                                                 |
    |                                                                                 |
    |                                                                                 |
    |               AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE               |
    |                             (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)                             |
    |_________________________________________________________________________________|

     If you remove the x (using the space bar), access will be
     denied to that class of user.  If you type an x, access will
     be granted to that class of user.

BUGS
     Under 3.0, access to the mapset PERMANENT must be open to
     all users.  This is because GRASS looks for the default and
     the location title in files under the PERMANENT mapset.  The
     access command, therefore, will not allow you to restrict
     access to PERMANENT.

     Also, the mapsets command isn't smart enough to tell if
     access to a specified mapset is restricted. The user is
     allowed to include restricted mapsets in the search path.

     However, the data in the mapset is still protected. Any
     attempts to look for or use data in a restricted mapset will
     fail. The user will simply not see any data.
