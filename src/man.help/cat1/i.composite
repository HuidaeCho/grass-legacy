NAME
     i.composite -  An imagery function that creates a color
                    composite image from three band specified by
                    the user
                    (GRASS Imagery Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     i.composite

DESCRIPTION
     i.composite creates a color composite image from three band
     specified by the user.  The user specifies the bands to be
     used by assigning a red, blue, or green color to each band.
     The resulting image is a cell of raw spectral data composed
     of the three bands chosen by the user. The color composite
     can then be displayed, painted, or manipulated as would any
     cell in GRASS.

     The first prompt asks the user for the imagery group.

     The following menu is then displayed:

     Please indicate which files to use for red, green, and blue
     colors.  You may leave any color out. You may specify more
     than one color per file.  However, each color may only be
     specified once.  For example, to get a full color image,
     specify r,g,b for 3 different files.  To get a grey scale
     image, specify rgb for a single file.

                          b__    spot.1
                          g__    spot.2
                          r__    spot.3
                          ___    spotclass
                          ___    spotreject

         AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                       (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)


     The user is then allowed to check the choice of bands:

                     Colors assigned as follows:

                    RED:     spot.3 in mapsetname
                    GREEN:   spot.2 in mapsetname
                    BLUE:    spot.1 in mapsetname

                          Look ok? (y/n) [y]


     The color table that is created has 1000 colors (10
     saturation levels (or shades) per primary color (blue,

     green, red)).  The number of colors that can be displayed at
     one time on a color monitor will depend on the graphics
     monitor being used.  For example, if the graphics monitor
     can only display 512 colors at one time, then the user must
     run the GRASS command Dcolormode fixed before displaying the
     The colors that cannot be displayed will be assigned to the
     nearest displayable color, and the will retain its relative
     color accuracy.  If the user is in float colormode, however,
     the displayed on the monitor will not have accurate colors.

     The user is then asked to name the composite image The
     percentage completed is echoed to the screen and support
     files are created automatically.

NOTES
     The user should always check the window before running most
     imagery commands. It is very easy for the window to be
     completely off the image.  Before running i.composite, or
     other imagery commands, the user should probably set the
     window to match the to be read.  This can be accomplished
     using option 4 of the window command.
