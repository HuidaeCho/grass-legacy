NAME
     describe - Prints terse list of found in cell
     (Available through grass3 menu)

SYNOPSIS
     describe

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS tool describe examines a user-specified describe
     prompts the user for a name.  The user can select one of the
     following two output reports:

     (1) RANGE.  A range of found in the will be printed.  The
     range is divided into three groups: negative, positive, and
     zero.  If negative values occur, the minimum and maximum
     negative values will be printed.  If positive values occur,
     the minimum and maximum positive values will be printed.  If
     zero occurs, this will be indicated.

     (2) FULL LIST.  A list of all that were found in the will be
     printed.

     The following sample output from describe:

          0 2-4 10-13

     means that category values 0, 2 through 4, and 10 through 13
     occurred in the named

     The user must choose to read the in one of two ways:

     (1) DIRECTLY.  The current and mask are ignored and the full
     is read.  This method is useful if the user intends to
     reclassify or rescale the data, since these functions
     (reclass[1] and rescale[1]) also ignore the current
      and mask.

     (2) WINDOWED and MASKED.  The is read in the current masked
     by the current mask.

NOTES
     The range report will generally run faster than the full
     list.
