NAME
     Digraph - Graphics interface for GRASS on the Intergraph.
     (Map Development Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     Digraph

DESCRIPTION
     Digraph is the GRASS interface to the GRASS graphics driver
     on the Intergraph workstations.  GRASS can be run from an
     ascii terminal or from a window on the Intergraph
     workstation.  There are some pitfalls to running GRASS from
     a window; these pitfalls are mentioned in the NOTES section.
     When Digraph is run a pull-down menu will appear on the
     workstation screen and some information will be displayed on
     the ascii terminal.  The pull-down menu will work the same
     way all Intergraph pull down menus work.
      The pull-down menu will look like this:

                       _______________________
                      |  GRASS Commands      |
                      |  start/select        |
                      |  stop                |
                      |  GRASS Graphics      |
                      |  resize/move         |
                      |  virtual screens    >|
                      |  colors             >|
                      | EXIT                 |
                      |______________________|


     The pull-down menu is broken into two categories: GRASS
     Commands and GRASS Graphics.  GRASS Commands in the pull-
     down menu are commands that can also be ran from the GRASS3
     command line.  This menu interface was developed to make it
     easier and faster for users to run these commands.  GRASS
     Graphics are commands that can modify the size and placement
     of the graphics window.

     The first command under GRASS Commands is start/select and
     will start the graphics driver IGRAPH and then select it for
     output.  This pull-down menu command is equivalent to typing
     these two commands:
                          Dstart.mon IGRAPH
                          Dselect.mon IGRAPH
     Using the start/select option saves the user from having to
     type the above commands.  After the graphics driver is
     started, the pull-down menu will disappear and the Digraph
     program will exit and leave the user at the GRASS prompt.
     When the second command (stop) under GRASS Commands is
     selected, it will stop the graphics driver IGRAPH.  The
     equivalent GRASS command is: Dstop.mon IGRAPH.

     The second category (GRASS Graphics) in the pull-down menu
     contains three commands written for the GRASS graphics
     driver IGRAPH.  These commands will only affect the graphics
     driver the next time it is started.  They will not affect
     the graphics driver once the graphics driver has been
     started.

     The first command in the second category is resize/move.
     When the resize/move command is selected, the pull-down menu
     will disappear and a window will be created on the graphics
     monitor. The window will be called the Resize window and it
     will be the color gray.  The Resize window will be the exact
     size and at the same location as the graphics screen would
     be if the graphics driver had been started.  Use the resize
     and move icons on the Resize window to modify the window as
     desired. When the window is at the desired size and
     location, delete the Resize window.  To delete the window,
     move the mouse to the left side of the icon strip at the top
     of the Resize window and click the mouse on the small box
     with an X in it.  Notice that the window size is displayed
     on the ascii terminal in which the Digraph program was
     started.  Now, every time the graphics monitor is started,
     the window will be the same size and at the same location as
     the Resize window.

     The second command is virtual screens.  This command has a
     sub-menu with a listing of virtual screen numbers (from 0 to
     3).  Of the virtual screen numbers listed (0 to 3), only one
     or two of those numbers will be active and selectable from
     the sub-menu.  The number of selectable virtual screen
     numbers will depend on the type of workstation and its
     virtual screen configuration.  When the IGRAPH driver is
     started, it will be placed on the virtual screen whose
     number was picked by this command.  Notice that the current
     virtual screen number is displayed on the ascii terminal n
     which the Digraph program was started.

     The third and final command is colors.  This command has a
     sub-menu with a listing of the possible range of active
     colors the workstations will support (16 to 512).  The
     number of active colors is determined by the number of
     planes the graphics processor supports  (9 planes will give
     512 active colors).  We do not suggest running GRASS with
     fewer than 256 active colors.


     Each workstation can be configured differently with the
     number of virtual screens and the available number of
     colors.  A certain amount of testing will have to been done
     to determine what works best with a particular workstation.

     The last command is the EXIT command.  This command is used
     to leave the Digraph program.


USING THE GRAPHICS WINDOW
     Once the GRASS graphics driver is started, a window will
     appear on the screen.  The GRASS graphics window is mouse-
     activated.  The mouse must be within the GRASS graphics
     window for the true GRASS colors to be displayed on the
     graphics window.  The mouse doesn't have to be clicked
     inside the window; just moving the mouse within the window
     is enough to activate the window.  If the mouse is outside
     the GRASS graphics window, the colors in the graphics window
     will be random.


NOTES
     When using the GRASS programs d.colors or the interact
     selection in the display program, the mouse must be within
     the GRASS graphics window when toggling or highlighting
     categories.  If the mouse is not within the graphics window,
     the colors will not represent the true category colors.
     Using the two programs mentioned above while running GRASS
     from an Intergraph window (ascii window) creates a problem;
     The mouse must be within the graphics window at all times
     for those programs to work properly, but the mouse also must
     be moved to the ascii window to activate the ascii window so
     that commands can be typed.  This is not a problem when
     GRASS is run from an ascii terminal, because the mouse can
     be left within the GRASS graphics window at all times.
