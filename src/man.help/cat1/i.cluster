NAME
     i.cluster -   An imagery function that generates spectral
                   signatures for land cover types in an image
                   using a clustering algorithm.  The resulting
                   signature file is used as input for i.maxlik.

SYNOPSIS
     i.cluster

DESCRIPTION
     i.cluster performs the first pass in the GRASS two-pass
     unsupervised classification of imagery, while the GRASS
     program i.maxlik executes the second pass.  Both programs
     must be run to complete the unsupervised classification.

     i.cluster is a clustering algorithm that reads through the
     imagery and builds clusters based on the spectral
     reflectances of the The clusters are imagery categories that
     can be related to land cover types on the ground.  The
     spectral distributions of the clusters (which will be the
     land cover spectral signatures) are influenced by six
     parameters set by the user.  The first parameter set by the
     user is the initial number of clusters to be discriminated.
     i.cluster starts by generating spectral signatures for this
     number of clusters and "attempts" to end up with this number
     of clusters during the clustering process.  The resulting
     number of clusters and their spectral distributions,
     however, are also influenced by the range of the spectral
     values (category values) in the image and the other
     parameters set by the user.  These parameters are: the
     minimum cluster size, minimum cluster separation, the
     percent convergence, the number of iterations, and the row
     and column sampling interval.

     The cluster spectral signatures that result are composed of
     cluster means and covariance matrices.  These cluster means
     and covariance matrices are used in the second pass
     (i.maxlik) to classify the image.   The clusters or spectral
     classes that result can be related to land cover types on
     the ground.


USER INPUTS
     The first menu in the program i.cluster asks the user for
     the imagery group and subgroup to be analyzed:

       LOCATION: location        CLUSTER          MAPSET: demo

           Please select the group/subgroup to be analyzed

                         GROUP:      spot____

         AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                       (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)


     The group should contain the imagery that the user wishes to
     classify.  The subgroup is a subset of this group that the
     user must create by running the GRASS program i.group before
     running i.cluster.  This subgroup should contain only the
     imagery band that the user wishes to classify.  Note that
     this subgroup must contain more than one band The purpose of
     the group and subgroup is to collect for classification or
     analysis.

     The first prompt inside the program asks the user for the
     name of the resulting signature file.  The signature file is
     both the output file for i.cluster and the required input
     file for the GRASS program i.maxlik.  It contains the
     cluster means and covariance matrices that are used to
     classify an image in i.maxlik.

     After entering the signature file name, the user is asked to
     enter the name of a seed signature file.  This is optional.
     Seed signatures are signatures that contain cluster means
     and covariance matrices that were calculated prior to the
     current run of i.cluster.  They may be acquired from a
     previous run of i.cluster or a supervised classification
     signature training site selection (not currently available
     in GRASS 3.0).  The purpose of seed signatures is to
     optimize the cluster decision boundaries (means) for the
     number of clusters specified.

     The final menu asks the user for the clustering parameters.
     The default values in the menu are the suggested values
     based upon the total number of rows and columns in the image
     This menu also informs the user of the number of rows and
     columns of the image that are included in the current
     window.  Make sure that this window is large enough to
     include the portion of the image that you wish to classify.

     Number of initial classes
          This is the number of clusters that will initially be
          identified in the clustering process before the
          iterations begin.

     Minimum class size
          This is the minimum number of that will be used to
          define a cluster, and is therefore the minimum number
          of for which means and covariance matrices will be
          calculated.

     Minimum class separation
          This is the minimum separation below which clusters
          will be merged in the iteration process.  This is an
          image-specific number (a "magic" number) that depends
          on the image being classified and the number of final
          clusters that are acceptable.  Its determination
          requires experimentation.  Note that as the minimum
          class (or cluster) separation is increased, the maximum
          number of iterations should also be increased to
          achieve this separation with a high percentage of
          convergence (see percent convergence.

     Percent convergence
          A high percent convergence is the point at which
          cluster means become stable during the iteration
          process.  When clusters are being created, their means
          constantly change as are assigned to them and the mean
          is recalculated to include the new After all clusters
          have been created, i.cluster begins iterations that
          change cluster means by maximizing the distances
          between them.  As these means shift, a higher and
          higher convergence is approached.  Because means will
          never become totally static, a percent convergence and
          a maximum number of iterations is supplied to stop the
          iterative process. The percent convergence should be
          reached before the maximum number of iterations.  If
          the maximum number of iterations is reached, it is
          probable that the desired percent convergence was not
          reached.  The number of iterations is reported in the
          cluster statistics in mail (see NOTES).

     Maximum number of iterations
          This is a number which is greater than the number of
          iterations predicted to achieve the optimum percent
          convergence. If the number of iterations reaches the
          maximum designated by the user, the user may want to
          rerun i.cluster with a higher number of iterations (see
          NOTES).

     Row and column sampling intervals
          These numbers are based on the size of the data set.

NOTES
     i.cluster will run in the background and notify the user by
     mail when it is complete.  The mail message will contain the
     results, i.e., the statistics for each cluster.  Also
     included in the  mail message are the resulting percent
     convergence for the clusters, the number of iterations that
     were required to achieve the convergence, and the
     separability matrix.

     i.group must be run before i.cluster to create an imagery
     subgroup containing the image to be classified.
