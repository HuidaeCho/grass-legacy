NAME
     reclass - Create new cell based upon existing cell
     (Available through grass3 menu)

SYNOPSIS
     reclass

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS program reclass allows a user to create a new
     based upon a category reclassification of an existing This
     new will be a reclassification of the original map, based
     upon the information the user provided using the reclass
     program.

     Before using reclass one must know the following:



     1    The new categories desired; and, which old categories
          fit into which new categories.

     2    The of the new categories.


EXAMPLE
     Suppose we want to reclassify the cell "roads" consisting of
     five categories into the three new categories:  paved roads,
     unpaved roads, and railroad tracks.  The following screen
     lists the categories of the "roads" cell to be reclassified
     and prompts the user for the new category to be assigned
     them.

     Based upon the information supplied by the user in the above
     sample screens, the new cell map, supporting category,
     color, history, and header files are created.

NOTE
     In fact, the reclass program does not generate any new maps
     (in the interests of disk space conservation).  Instead, a
     reclass table is stored which will be used to reclassify the
     original map each time the new (reclassed) map name is
     requested.  As far as the user (and programmer) is
     concerned, that map has been created.  Also note that
     although the user can generate a reclass map which is based
     on another reclass map, the new reclass map will be stored
     in GRASS as a reclass of the original map.  Therefore, while
     GRASS allows the user to provide reclass information which

reclass(1)           GRASS Reference Manual            reclass(1)



     is based on an already reclassified map (for the user's
     convenience), no reclass map (i.e., reclass table) will ever
     be stored as a reclass of a reclass.

BEWARE
     Because reclass generates a table referencing some original
     map rather than creating a reclassed map, a reclass "cell
     map" will no longer be accessible if the original map upon
     which it was based is later removed.

NOTES
     To convert a reclass to a regular cell set your window to
     match the header for the reclass and then run resample.
