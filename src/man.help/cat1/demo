NAME
     demo - Interactive graphical tour through GRASS

SYNOPSIS
     demo

DESCRIPTION
     Demo provides an interactive graphical tour through GRASS
     basics. The user works through a self guided tour using the
     mouse.  This program must be run while working inside the
     spearfish sample data base.

     Demo is also a relatively involved demonstration of how to
     mix UNIX Bourne shell and UNIX commands with GRASS D and G
     tools.  There are numerous shell scripts which work together
     as one coherent user interface program.  Those interested in
     mixing GRASS capabilities with dbms, report writer,
     statistical package, and other computer software
     capabilities will do well to use these programs as starting
     examples.   The complete set of shell scripts can be found
     in the demo directory under the GRASS main directory.
