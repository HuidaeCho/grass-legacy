NAME
     clump - Groups physically discrete areas into unique
     categories
     (Available through grass3 menu)

SYNOPSIS
     clump

DESCRIPTION
     Clump finds all areas of contiguous cells in an input and
     assigns them unique category values. The user is prompted
     for the input and output names.

     Category distinctions in the input are preserved. This means
     that if distinct categories are adjacent, they will NOT be
     clumped together.  (If this is not desired, use the GRASS
     tool reclass[1] to combine the categories into one
     category.)

ALGORITHM
     Clump moves a 2x2 matrix over the input The lower right-hand
     corner of the matrix is grouped with the cells above it, or
     to the left of it.  (The cell diagonal from it is not
     considered.)

NOTES
     Clump works properly with that contain only "fat" areas
     (more than a single cell in width). Linear elements (lines
     that are a single cell wide) may or may not be clumped
     together depending on the direction of the line - horizontal
     and vertical are contiguous, but diagonal lines are not
     considered contiguous and are broken up into separate
     clumps.

     A random color table is generated for the output
