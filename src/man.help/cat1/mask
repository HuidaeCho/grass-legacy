NAME
     mask - Choose/delete the working mask
     (Available through grass3 menu)

SYNOPSIS
     mask

DESCRIPTION
     The tool mask manages the current working mask At the user's
     option, one of the available GRASS can be used as a mask to
     indicate an area (or set of areas) of interest.  If a mask
     has been identified, access to all data will be restricted
     to areas within the current mask.

     Mask provides the following options:

       1     Remove the current mask
       2     Identify a new mask
     RETURN  Exit from program

     Upon choosing to "identify a new mask" and selecting a the
     user is presented with a listing of the categories for the
     selected Those categories which the user specifies by typing
     a "1" in the blank will designate the areas for which data
     will remain (and will be inside the mask). All other areas
     will have a value of "0" in all in the mapset as long as the
     mask is in place.

NOTES
     The above method for specifying a "mask" may seem counter to
     what is intuitive.  Areas inside the mask are not hidden.
     Rather, those areas which are left as zero values are those
     which cannot be seen.  Zeroed areas will be outside the
     mask.

     This program actually creates a cell (reclass type) called
     MASK. It can be manipulated (renamed, removed, copied, etc.)
     like any other cell
