NAME
     i.tape.other - An imagery function that extracts scanned
                    aerial imagery (NHAP, etc.) and SPOT imagery
                    from half inch tape
                    (GRASS Imagery Tool)

SYNOPSIS
     i.tape.other

DESCRIPTION
     i.tape.other is a generic program that extracts imagery from
     tape using the tape description that is input by the user.

     This program must be run in a LOCATION with a x,y coordinate
     system (i.e., a coordinate system with projection 0).  For
     further information regarding this LOCATION refer to the
     manual entry imagery[5].

     The first prompt in i.tape.other asks the user for the tape
     device name.  This is sometimes  /dev/rmt0 (for a density of
     1600), but this varies with each machine.

     The next prompt is:
     Please mount and load tape, then hit RETURN -->


IMAGE IDENTIFICATION MENU
     The first menu in the program asks the user for information
     about the data.

               please enter the following information

         Tape Identification:                             __

         Image Description:                               __

     number of tape files to be skipped
          If there are files at the beginning of the tape which
          are not image data, they can be skipped. Sometimes
          information that comes with a tape will indicate the
          number of header files or records on the tape.  The
          GRASS utility examine.tape will also provide this
          information.  The record length is the number of
          columns in the image, while the number of records is
          the number of rows in the image.  NHAP imagery and
          usually most scanned aerial imagery do not have tape
          header files, but this should be checked.  SPOT imagery
          has two files that should be skipped on the first tape,
          and one file to be skipped on the second tape (of a
          two-tape set).

     number of records in the remaining files to be skipped
          If the files which contain the image begin with non-
          image data, these records can also be skipped.  This is
          usually 0 for most data types.  SPOT imagery stored in
          1600bpi has one header record in the image file on each
          tape that should be skipped.

     number of bands on the tape
          Most aerial imagery have 3 bands, but satellite
          simulator data may have more.  SPOT has 3 bands as a
          standard.  The total number of bands on the tape should
          be specified here, not just the number that will be
          extracted.

     data format
          The two formats that imagery data are most commonly
          stored in are called band interleaved format (BIL) and



GRASS 3.2                U.S. Army CERL                         2






i.tape.other(1)      GRASS Reference Manual       i.tape.other(1)



          band sequential format (BSQ).  In BIL format, each
          record on the tape contains one line for one band of
          data.  If the data contains three bands, then the first
          five records will look like this:

                              band 1, line 1
                              band 2, line 1
                              band 3, line 1
                              band 1, line 2
                              band 2, line 2

          In BSQ format, all lines of one band are stored
          together on a tape, followed by all lines of another
          band, followed by all lines of the next band, etc.
          These data are stored as if they were in a one band BIL
          format:

                              band 1, line 1
                              band 1, line 2
                              band 1, line 3
                                       .
                                       .
                                       .
                              band 2, line 1
                              band 2, line 2
                                       .
                                       .
                             band 2, line 156
                             band 2, line 157

          Each pixel contains one byte and there is one line per
          record.  BSQ format is the format that is usually
          created by optical scanning devices when they scan
          photographs, but not all digitized aerial imagery are
          stored in this format.  The format of the data is
          usually written on the exterior of the tape;  this
          should be checked.

     length (in bytes) of the longest record on the tape
          This must be set to the number of bytes in the longest
          data record.  It is used to determine how large a
          buffer to use for reading the tape. This value can be
          obtained using examine.tape.

BAND EXTRACTION MENU
     The user is then asked to mark an x beside the bands to be
     extracted.  See the subheading in this entry entitled ROW
     AND COLUMN EXTRACTION.

           please mark an x by the bands you want extracted

                       (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)


PREFIX/GROUP NAME
     The user is asked to enter the prefix/group for the band
     cell to be created.  This name will precede each band
     extracted into GRASS.  For example, if 3 bands are extracted
     the following 3 band will result:

                          prefixname.1
                          prefixname.2
                          prefixname.3

     The specified prefixname will also automatically become the
     name for the imagery group file being created.  Each image
     (i.e., each run of i.tape.other) should be given a unique
     prefix/group name.

ROW AND COLUMN MENU
     Finally, the starting row, ending row, starting column and
     ending column are required. This allows the user to extract
     any subset of the image from the tape.

                               EXTRACT
             please select desired tape window to extract

                            start row:_0_
                              end row:_0_


                            start col:_0_
                              end col:_0_



         AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                       (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

     The extraction process will begin by first skipping the
     number of specified files, advancing to the starting row,
     and then reading the tape.  The percent completion of the
     extraction is displayed on the screen.

     Following the extraction, the extracted band will be listed
     as cell available in the current MAPSET. These may be
     displayed individually using the GRASS commands display,

     Dcell or i.points.

NOTES
     After extracting an image from tape, the window in the x,y
     coordinate LOCATION will be set, based upon the extracted
     rows and columns from the tape. The relationship between the
     image rows and columns and the window coordinates is
     discussed in the manual entry imagery[5].


ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION
     The display options in allow the user to locate rows and
     columns on the digital image.  If enough disk space is
     available, one band of an entire image, or one band of a
     portion of an image known to contain the area of interest,
     can be extracted and displayed.  The measurements option in
     display, or Dwhere (following a run of Dcell) will echo x
     and y coordinates to the screen.  (These coordinates will
     display negative numbers in the north-south direction but
     ignoring the negative sign will yield the row number.  See
     the manual entry imagery[5] for further explanation.)

     If a photograph of the digital image is available, the rows
     and columns to be extracted can be determined from it by
     associating inches with the total number of known rows and
     columns in the scene.  For example, if the total length of
     the photograph is 12 inches, the total number of rows on the
     tape is 2000, and the northwest corner of the area of
     interest begins 2 inches from the top of the photo, then:

                    12" / 2000 rows = 2" / x rows
                             x = 333.333

     The northwest corner of the area of interest starts at row
     333.  The starting row, ending row, starting column, and
     ending column can be calculated in this manner.
