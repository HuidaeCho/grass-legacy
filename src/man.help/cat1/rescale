NAME
     rescale - Rescales the values in a
     (Available through grass3 menu)

SYNOPSIS
     rescale

DESCRIPTION
     The rescale program creates a new that is a rescaling of an
     existing This command is useful for producing
     representations with a reduced number of categories from a
     with a large range of category values (e.g., elevation).
     Rescaled are appropriate for use in such GRASS programs as
     cell.stats[1], report[1], and coin[1].

     The user is prompted for the name of the
      to be rescaled, and for the name of the resulting

     The user is also prompted for the input range and the output
     range.  These ranges determine the scaling to be performed.
     The ranges are input as minimum and maximum values.  For
     example, if the elevation contained category values ranging
     from 1090 meters to 1800 meters, the user could set the
     input range to: 1090 1800, and the output range to: 1 255.

     An appropriate category file and color table based upon the
     original map are generated with category labels that reflect
     the original values that produced each category.

NOTES
     The rescaled range is actually unlimited, but the range 1 to
     255 is frequently used due to limitations of color

     which falls beyond the input range will become zero.  This
     allows the user to select a subset of the full range for
     rescaling if desired.  This also means that the user should
     know the range for the input The user can request the
     rescale program to determine this range, or can obtain it
     using the describe[1] command.  If the range is determined
     using rescale, the input is examined, and the minimum and
     maximum non-zero values are selected as the input range.

     The rescale program actually runs reclass[1] to represent
     the rescaled categories.
