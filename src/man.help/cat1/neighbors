NAME
     neighbors - GRASS enhancement capability
     (Available through grass3 menu)

SYNOPSIS
     neighbors

DESCRIPTION
     The GRASS tool neigbors is an interactive program to enhance
     or subdue values by modifying a value based on the values in
     surrounding (neighbor) cells.

USER OPTIONS
     The user must specify the size of the neighborhood and the
     function or operation to be performed in each neighborhood.

     Neighborhood Size: The neighborhood size specifies which
     cells surrounding any given cell fall into the neighborhood
     for that cell.  The size must be an odd integer. For
     example:
                                   _ _ _
                                  |_|_|_|
         3 x 3 neighborhood --->  |_|_|_|
                                  |_|_|_|


     Neighborhood Operations: The neighborhood operators
     determine what new value a center cell in a neighborhood
     will have after examining values inside its neighboring
     cells. Each cell in a becomes the center cell of a
     neighborhood as the neighborhood window moves from cell to
     cell throughout the neighbors can perform the following
     operations:


     mode The most frequently occurring value in the
          neighborhood.

     min  The minimum value within the neighborhood.

     max  The maximum value within the neighborhood.

     ave  The average value within the neighborhood.  In the
          following example, the result would be:
               (7*4 + 6 + 5 + 4*3)/9 + 0.5 = 6.16
          The result is rounded to the nearest integer.

     diversity
          The number of different values within the neighborhood.
          In the above example, the diversity is four.

     interspersion
          The number of cells containing categories which differ
          from the center category.  In the above example, the
          interspersion is five.

NOTES
     The neighbors program works in the current window with the
     current mask, if any.  It is recommended, but not required,
     that the window resolution be the same as that of the cell
     If the resolutions differ, the user will be notified and
     asked if it is ok to proceed.
