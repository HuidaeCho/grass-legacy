NAME
     coin - Tabulates the mutual occurrence (coincidence) of
     categories for two
     (Available through grass3 menu)

SYNOPSIS
     coin

DESCRIPTION
     Coin tabulates the mutual occurrence of two categories with
     respect to one another.   This analysis works within the
     current geographic window and mask.

     The user is prompted for the names of the two which will be
     the subjects of the coincidence analysis. Coin then
     tabulates the coincidence and prepares the basic table from
     which the report is to created. This tabulation is followed
     by an indication of how long the coincidence table will be.
     If the table is extremely long, the user may decide that
     viewing it is not so important after all, and may cancel the
     request at this point. Assuming the user continues, coin
     then allows the user to choose one of eight units in which
     to view the report. These units are:

          c: cells
          p: percent cover
          x: percent of <map name> category (column)
          y: percent of <map name> category (row)
          a: acres
          h: hectares
          k: square kilometers
          m: square miles

     Note that three of these options give percentages:  "p" is
     based on the grand total number of cells; "x" is based on
     column totals; and "y" is based on row totals.  Type in just
     one of the letters followed by a <RETURN>.  The report will
     be printed to the screen for review.  After reviewing the
     report on the screen, the user is given several options.
     The report may be saved in a file and/or the report may be
     sent to a printer. If printed, it may be printed with either
     80 or 132 columns.  Finally, the user may choose to rerun
     coin using a different unit of measurement.

     Below is a sample output from coin.  Here, map unit output
     is stated in square miles.  The report reveals the
     coincidence of "owner" and "road" in the Spearfish sample
     The "owner" categories in this case refer to whether the
     land is in private hands (category 1) or is owned by the
     U.S. Forest Service (category 2).  The "roads" categories
     refer to various types of roads (with the exception of
     category "0", which indicates "no data";  i.e., no roads).

     Coin does not report category labels. The user should run
     report[1] or Greport[2G] to obtain this information.

     The body of the report is arranged in panels. The with the
     most categories is arranged along the vertical axis of the
     table; the other, along the horizontal axis. Each panel has
     a maximum of 5 categories (9 if printed) across the top. In
     addition, the last two columns reflect a cross total of each
     column for each row. All of the categories of the arranged
     along the vertical axis are included in each panel. There is
     a total at the bottom of each column representing the sum of
     all the rows in that column. A second total represents the
     sum of all the non-zero category rows. A cross total (Table
     Row Total) of all columns for each row appears in a separate
     panel.







     Note how the following information may be obtained from the
     sample report.

     In the Spearfish in area not owned by the Forest Service,
     there are 50.63 square miles of land not used for roads.
     Roads make up 9.27 square miles of land in this area.
     Of the total 102.70 square miles in Spearfish, 42.80 square
     miles is owned by the Forest Service.
     In total, there are 14.58 square miles of roads.
     There are more category 2 roads outside Forest Service land
     (2.92 mi. sq.) than there are inside Forest land boundaries
     (0.72 mi. sq.).

     Following is a sample report.

NOTES
     It is not a good idea to run coin on a which has a monstrous
     number of categories (such as unreclassed elevation).
     Because coin reports information for each and every
     category, it is better to reclass[1] those categories into a
     more manageable number prior to running coin on the
     reclassed cell

     Coin calculates the coincidence of two Although coin allows
     the user to rerun the report using different units, it is
     not possible to simply rerun the report with different In
     order to choose new it is necessary to rerun coin.
