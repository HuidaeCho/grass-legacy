demo \- Interactive graphical tour through GRASS
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B demo
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIDemo\fR provides an interactive graphical tour through GRASS basics. The
user works through a self guided tour using the mouse.  This program must
be run while working inside the \fBspearfish\fR sample data base.
.PP
\fIDemo\fR is also a relatively involved demonstration of how to mix UNIX
Bourne shell and UNIX commands with GRASS D and G tools.  There are numerous
shell scripts which work together as one coherent user interface program.
Those interested in mixing GRASS capabilities with \fIdbms, report writer,
statistical package,\fR and other computer software capabilities will
do well to use these programs as starting examples.   The complete set
of shell scripts can be found in the \fBdemo\fR directory under the 
GRASS main directory.
