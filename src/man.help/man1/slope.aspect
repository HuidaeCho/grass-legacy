.SH NAME
slope.aspect \- Generates slope and aspect 
.CT "" cell
maps from elevation

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B slope.aspect
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIslope.aspect\fR program generates slope and aspect 
.CT "" cell
maps from
elevation data.  The resulting slope and aspect 
.CT "" cell
maps are named by the
user and will be created in the current \fImapset\fR.
.SH ELEVATION CELL MAP
The elevation 
.CT layer "cell map"
specified by the user must contain true elevation values,
not rescaled or categorized data.
.SH ASPECT CELL MAP
The aspect 
.CT file "cell map"
which is created indicates the direction that the
slopes are facing. The aspect categories are as follows:

.NF
.ne 18
  0   no data
  1   east facing
  2   15 degrees north of east
  3   30 degrees north of east
  4   northeast facing
  5   30 degrees east of north
  6   15 degrees east of north
  7   north facing
  8   15 degrees west of north
  9   30 degrees west of north
 10   northwest facing
 11   30 degrees north of west
 12   15 degrees north of west
 13   west facing
 14   15 degrees south of west
 15   30 degrees south of west
 16   southwest facing
 17   30 degrees west of south
 18   15 degrees west of south
 19   south facing
 20   15 degrees east of south
 21   30 degrees east of south
 22   southeast facing
 23   30 degrees south of east
 24   15 degrees south of east
 25   no aspect (flat)
.FI

Category and color table files are also generated for the
aspect 
.CT "layer." "cell map."
.SH SLOPE CELL MAP
The resulting slope 
.CT layer "cell map"
will contain slope in degrees of inclination
from the horizontal. Category 0 will be reserved for no data.
Category 1 will be 0 degrees slope, category 2 will be 1 degree, etc.
The slope 
.CT layer "cell map"
could contain, in theory, up to 91 categories.
The category file (but not the color table) is generated for the slope
.CT layer "cell map"
by \fIslope.aspect\fR.

Often slope is represented in percent rise.  The following conversion
table is presented which converts from degrees to percent:

However, for most applications, it will be desired to reclassify
the slopes into groups using the GRASS tool \fIreclass[1]\fR.
The following is an example of a useful reclassification:

.NF
.ne 10
    category     range       category labels
             (in degrees)     (in percent)
    
       1           0-1            0-2%
       2           2-3            3-5%
       3           4-5            6-10%
       4           6-8           11-15%
       5           9-11          16-20%
       6          12-14          21-25%
       7          15-90          26% and higher
.FI

Also, the following color table works well with the above reclassification.

.NF
.ne 10
      category      red  green  blue

         0           70%   70%   70%
         1            0%   40%    0%
         2            0%   60%    0%
         3           50%   60%    0%
         4           80%   70%    0%
         5           50%   20%   20%
         6          100%    0%    0%
         7            0%    0%    0%

.SH NOTES
The current 
.CT "" geographic
\fIwindow\fR and \fImask\fR settings are ignored.
The elevation 
.CT file "cell map"
is read directly to insure that data is not lost
or inappropriately resampled.

The algorithm used to determine slope and aspect uses a 3x3 neighborhood
around each elevation cell.
Thus it is not possible to determine slope and aspect for the cells adjacent
to the edges in the elevation 
.CT "data layer." "cell map."
These cell are assigned
"no data"
in both the slope and aspect 
.CT "files." "cell maps."
.SH WARNING
It is not possible to distinguish "no data" 
.CT "" category
values from elevations of 0,
since 0 or below sea level elevations are valid.
If the elevation 
.CT layer "cell map"
contains 0 
.CT "" category
values which represent "no data"
.CT "" category
values, either at its edges or in its interior,
incorrect (and usually quite large) slopes will result.
