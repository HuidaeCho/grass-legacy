.TH clump 1
.SH NAME
clump \- Groups physically discrete areas into unique categories
.br
(Available through \fBgrass3\fR menu)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B clump
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIClump\fR finds all areas of contiguous cells in an input
.CT layer "cell map"
and assigns 
them unique category values. The user is prompted for the input and
output 
.CT layer "cell map"
names.

Category distinctions in the input
.CT layer "cell map"
are preserved. This means that
if distinct categories are adjacent, they will NOT be clumped together.
(If this is not desired, use the GRASS tool \fIreclass[1]\fR to combine
the categories into one category.)
.SH ALGORITHM
\fIClump\fR moves a 2x2 matrix over the input 
.CT "layer." "cell map."
The lower right-hand
corner of the matrix is grouped with the cells above it, or to the
left of it.
(The cell diagonal from it is not considered.)
.SH NOTES
\fIClump\fR works properly with 
.CT maps "cell maps"
that contain only "fat" areas
(more than a single cell in width). Linear elements (lines that are a single 
cell wide) may or may not be clumped together depending on the direction of the
line \- horizontal and vertical are contiguous, but diagonal lines are not
considered contiguous and are broken up into separate clumps.

A random color table is generated for the output 
.CT "layer." "cell map."
