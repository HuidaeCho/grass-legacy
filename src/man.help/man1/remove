This menu will vary depending on the type of data elements which
exist in the 
.CT "database." "data base."

Once the type is selected, 
the user is prompted for the name of 
.CT "a file" "an element"
to be removed.
The 
.CT file element
is removed, and the user is again prompted for the name of
.CT "a file" "an element"
to be removed.

When prompted for 
.CT "a file" "an element"
name,
the user may enter \fBlist\fR to see a list of existing 
.CT "files," "elements,"
or hit RETURN to get back to the above menu.
.SH NOTE
If a particular 
.CT "data file" "data base element"
has support files (e.g., cell maps)
\fIremove\fR will automatically remove these support files as well.
.SH FILES
