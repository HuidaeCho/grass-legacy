mask \- Choose/delete the working mask

.B grass3
.I menu)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mask
.SH DESCRIPTION
The tool \fImask\fR manages the current working 
.I mask
.CT "file." "cell map."
At the user's option, one of the available GRASS 
.CT "map layers" "cell maps"
can be
used as a mask to indicate an area (or set of areas) of interest.  If a mask
has been identified, access to all 
.CT "map" "cell map"
data will be restricted to areas
\fIwithin\fR the current mask.
.PP
.I Mask
provides the following options:

.NF
  1     Remove the current mask
  2     Identify a new mask
RETURN  Exit from program
.FI

Upon choosing to "identify a new mask" and selecting a 
.CT "map layer," "cell map,"
the user is presented with
a listing of the categories for the selected 
.CT "map layer." "cell map."
Those
categories which the user specifies by typing a "1" in the blank
will designate the areas for which data will remain (and will be \fIinside\fR
the mask). All other
areas will have a 
.CT "" category
value of "0" in all 
.CT "map layers" "cell maps"
in the
mapset as long as the mask is in place.
.SH NOTES
The above method for specifying a "mask" may seem counter
to what is intuitive.  Areas inside the \fImask\fR are not hidden.
Rather, those areas which are left as zero 
.CT "" category
values are those which
cannot be seen.  Zeroed areas will be outside the \fImask\fR.

This program actually creates a cell 
.CT file map
(reclass type) called
\fIMASK\fR. It can be manipulated (renamed, removed, copied, etc.) like
any other cell 
.CT "file." "map."
