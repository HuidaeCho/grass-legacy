.SH NAME
rescale \- Rescales the values in a 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
.br
.I (Available through
.B grass3
.I menu)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rescale
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I rescale
program creates a new 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
that is a rescaling of an
existing 
.CT "data layer." "cell map."
This command is useful for producing representations with
a reduced number of categories from a 
.CT layer "cell map"
with a large range of category
values (e.g., elevation). 
.B Rescaled
.CT "map layers" "cell maps"
are appropriate for use in such GRASS programs as
\fIcell.stats[1], report[1]\fR, and \fIcoin[1]\fR.

The user is prompted for the name of the 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
 to be rescaled, and for
the name of the resulting 
.CT "data layer." "cell map."

The user is also prompted for the input 
.CT data "category value"
range and the
output 
.CT data "category value"
range.
These ranges determine the scaling to be performed.
The ranges are input as minimum and maximum values.
For example, if the elevation 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
contained category values ranging
from 1090 meters to 1800 meters, the user could set the input range
to: 1090 1800, and the output range to: 1 255.

An appropriate category file and color table based upon the original 
.CT "" cell
map are 
generated with category labels
that reflect the original 
.CT "" category
values that produced each
category.
.SH NOTES
The rescaled 
.CT data "category value"
range is actually unlimited, but the 
.CT data "category value"
range 1 to 255
is frequently used due to limitations of color 
.CT "display devices." "graphics monitors."

.CT Data "Category values"
which falls beyond the input range will become zero.
This allows the user to select a subset of the full 
.CT data "category value"
range for rescaling if desired.
This also means that the user should know the 
.CT data "category value"
range for
the input 
.CT "data layer." "cell map."
The user can request the \fIrescale\fR program to determine this
range, or can obtain it using the \fIdescribe[1]\fR command.  If
the 
.CT data "category value"
range is determined using \fIrescale\fR, the input 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
is examined, and the minimum and maximum non-zero
.CT "" category
values are selected as the input range.

The \fIrescale\fR program actually runs \fIreclass[1]\fR
to represent the rescaled categories.
