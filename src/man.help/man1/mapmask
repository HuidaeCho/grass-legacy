mapmask - Create cell

masks based on user-specified
polygons 
.XT "(geometric shapes, not polygonal data) from map layers"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mapmask
.SH DESCRIPTION
.na
The GRASS tool
.I mapmask
provides the user with the capability of defining specific
.I areas\ of\ interest
within a 
.CT "map layer." "cell map."
These can be specified using
regular geometric shapes, circles, or strings of corner coordinates.
The user has the choice of creating a \fIgeneric\fR 1/0 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
and/or
a \fIcookie cutter\fR 
.CT "map layer." "cell map."
A \fIgeneric\fR 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
has cell 
.CT values "category values"
of 1 within the areas of interest;  all other cells contain category 0.
A \fIcookie cutter\fR 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
retains
original category values from a \fIsource\fI 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
within the areas of interest.
.PP
The effectiveness of an analysis is often dependent upon the ability to clearly 
define the exact data to be studied, and to limit the data to this definition.
In geographic analysis, a common problem is found in trying to look at 
specific areas, which seldom correspond to mapped areas, or even to rectangles.
It is important for the user both to be able to define exact areas of interest
for specific analyses and to be able to quickly define general areas for an
overview.
.PP
.I Mapmask
gives the user the tools to meet these needs quickly and easily.
.PP
The user can create two types of 
.CT "map layers:" "cell maps:"
.PP
.ad
.ll -.5
.in +.75i
.ti -.25i
1)
A \fIgeneric\fR 1/0 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
can be created. Cells within the areas
of interest are coded with 1; cells outside the 
area are coded with 0.  This type of mask can be used to 
mask sections of different 
.CT "map layers" "cell maps"
for use in 
complicated analyses.  

.ti -.25i
2)
A \fIcookie-cutter\fR 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
can also be created.  This
type of mask is one that retains the data from a
source 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
in the areas specified by the user.
It
.I cannot
always be masked with other 
.CT "map layers." "cell maps."

.ti -.25i
3)
The user also has the option of creating both types
of 
.CT "map layers." "cell maps."

.PP
The user of
.I mapmask
has several options available when defining areas of interest:
.PP
.ad
.ll -.5
.in +.75i
.ti -.25i
1)
The user may choose to define a circle as an 
area of interest, specifying the center (easting/northing) 
and radius of the circle.

.ti -.25i
2)
The user may choose to define a regular polygon
as an area of interest, specifying the center 
(easting/northing) and radius of a circle which
circumscribes the polygon and the number of
sides the polygon will have.

.ti -.30i
3a)
The user may choose to define a specific polygonal
area, specifying the number of edges the area 
is to have (up to 50) and the coordinates 
for each corner of the area.  In this case, the 
corners of the area must be entered in a clockwise
order, though any corner can be entered first.

.ti -.30i
3b)
The user may choose to define a specific polygonal
area, specifying a file in which the coordinates
for the corner points have previously been entered.
In this case, the coordinates must be
arranged such that there is one coordinate pair per
line, with the northing in the first column, and the easting
in the second.
.na
.PP
.I Note:
These four options apply to each area of interest that is designated.
Therefore, a user
could have one circle, one regular hexagon, and a specific polygonal area
of interest all within one 
.CT "map layer." "cell map."
