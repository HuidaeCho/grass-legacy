.SH NAME
random \- Create a 
.CT map "cell map"
and 
.CT "sites list" "site map"
containing random locations
.br
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B random
.SH DESCRIPTION
The GRASS tool
.I random
allows the user to create a 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
and a 
.CT "sites list file" "site map"
containing
.I "locations"
which have been determined randomly.  The general region in which to generate
these random locations is determined by the current GRASS 
.CT "" geographic
\fIwindow\fR and
\fImask\fR.  The locations will fall within non-zero 
.CT data "category value"
areas on a current 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
specified by the user.  The user may specify
the quantity of random locations to be generated either as an
\fIabsolute number\fR (e.g., 10), or as a
\fIpercentage of the cell map's total area\fR (e.g., 10%, or 3.05%).  
If specified
as a percentage of total 
.CT map "cell map"
size, the number of random locations will be
set equal to the number of 
.XT grid 
cells contained within that percentage
of the 
.CT "map." "cell map."
Percentages under one percent may be specified using a
decimal point.  (Note that choosing 1% of a cell map's cells 
produces an abundance
of random locations.)

The new 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
is created
in the current mapset and contains randomly located 
.CT pixels cells
on a 
background of category zero.  The categories on the original 
.CT map "cell map"
where
random cells hit are copied to the new 
.CT "map." "cell map."
The category names from the input 
.CT map "cell map"
are also copied for the new 
.CT "map." "cell map."
A color table which will contrast with that of the input 
.CT map "cell map"
is generated
for the new 
.CT "map." "cell map."

The coordinates that are put into the 
.CT "sites file" "site map"
are the
.I centers
of the randomly selected cells.
.fi

The user may choose to create \fIboth\fR the cell map and the 
.CT "sites file;" "site map;"
or, the user may choose to create \fIonly\fR the cell 
.CT "file," "map,"
or \fIonly\fR
the 
.CT "sites file." "site map."
.SH NOTES
If it is desired to create random locations within some, but not all
non-zero categories of the input 
.CT "map," "cell map,"
the user must first create
a \fIreclass[1]\fR 
.CT map "cell map"
of the original 
.CT map "cell map"
containing
.XT with 
only the
desired categories, and use the reclassed 
.CT map "cell map"
as input to
.I random.

The \fIrandom\fR program
does allow the user the option of generating locations within category
zero as well. In this case, the locations which fall in areas of
category zero will be added as a new category to the output 
.CT "map." "cell map."
