.TH digit 1
.SH NAME
digit \- A menu-driven, highly interactive map development tool used for
digitizing, editing, labeling and converting vector data to 
.CT raster "cell map"
form.
.br
.I (Available through 
.B grass3
.I menu)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B digit
.SH DESCRIPTION
The GRASS tool
.I digit 
is a menu-driven, highly interactive map development tool used for inputting 
analog map data into a GRASS vector format.  \fIdigit\fR
contains tools for digitizing, editing, labeling, windowing and converting
the vector data to GRASS 
.CT cell "cell map"
format.
.PP
.SH FEATURES
.PP
\fIdigit\fR was written to optimize digitizing speed and performance.
It has a convenient graphic display format and very convenient windowing
capabilities.  Features are color-coded for ease of identification and
verification.
Different color schemes may be chosen to customize a digitizing session.
.br
Area, line and point features may be digitized in both "stream" and "point"
modes.  Both a mouse and a digitizer may be used to preform windowing functions.
Labeling and editing are done from within \fIdigit\fR, rather than through
a separate set of programs.
.br
\fIdigit\fR has capabilities to convert vector 
.CT files maps
to GRASS
.CT cell "cell map"
form, to overlay already created vector 
.CT files maps
onto the feature being
digitized, and set a multitude of parameters to customize a digitizing
session.
.br
\fIdigit\fR may be used with or without a digitizer.
Many options are available if no digitizer is used.
.br
All options available within \fIdigit\fR are contained within ten menus.
Movement from menu to menu is done by chosing the movement options
specified at the bottom of each menu.
.SH STRUCTURE
.PP
.I digit
consists of two parts: an initialization procedure, and a multiple menu-driven
environment.
.br
1) The initialization procedure involves choosing a digitizer, choosing a
.CT file "vector map"
to digitize and, if needed, registering a map to the digitizing surface.
.br
2) The second part of \fIdigit\fR is a multiple menu environment in which
digitizing, editing, labeling, and other options are available.  It is
within this second portion of \fIdigit\fR that all vector creation occurs.
