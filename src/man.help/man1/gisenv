.SH NAME
gisenv \- Lists GRASS 
.XT "-GRID"
user variables
.br
.I (Available through 
.B grass3
.I menu)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gisenv
.I [variable_name]
.SH DESCRIPTION
If run without arguments,
.I gisenv
lists the current GRASS 
.XT "-GRID" 
variables for the user.  Results produced
by this command may look like this:

.nf
.RS
GISDBASE\*=/usr/grass3/data
LOCATION_NAME\*=spearfish
MAPSET\*=PERMANENT
.RE
.fi

If \fIvariable_name\fR is specified, the value for that variable is output.

While there may be other variables associated with each session, those stated
below are essential.
.in +.5i

.ti -.5i
.I GISDBASE
- This is the top level directory. All GRASS 
.CT databases "data bases"
are within this directory. The
.B LOCATION_NAME
variable will exist along with other possible 
.CT "databases." "data bases."

.ti -.5i
.I LOCATION_NAME
- The name of the 
.CT database "data base"
currently being accessed by GRASS 
.XT "-GRID" 
commands.
This will be a directory under the directory given by the
.B GISDBASE
variable.   Under the
.B LOCATION_NAME
directory will be one or more 
.B MAPSET 
directories.  The directory "PERMANENT"
is reserved for the set of maps that form the base set for all users.

.ti -.5i
.I MAPSET
- Gives the directory name for the set of maps under the 
.B LOCATION_NAME
directory to which the user currently has write access.  Any maps created
by the user will be stored here.
.PP
All of these names must be legal names on the current system.  For UNIX users,
names less than 14 characters and containing no non-printing or space codes
are permissible.  Examples of permissible names include: one, mymap, VeGe_map,
and 1_for_me.  The underscore character can safely be used in place of a blank
for multiple word names.
.SH NOTES
The output from 
.I gisenv
without arguments is directly usable by /bin/sh. The following will cast
each variable into the UNIX environment:

.RS
eval `gisenv`
.RE

This works only for /bin/sh. The format of the output is not compatible with
other UNIX shells.
