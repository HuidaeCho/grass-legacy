.SH SYNOPSIS
.B window
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIwindow\fR program is a management tool for setting the current 
.CT "" geographic
window.
It enables the user to set the current 
.CT "" geographic
window both directly and from a
.CT database "data base"
of 
.CT "" geographic
windows. Each \fImapset\fR has a single current 
.CT "" geographic
window.
The user can create and modify as many 
.CT database "data base"
.CT "" geographic
windows as desired.
.SH MAIN MENU
The main menu consists of an information section with the 
.CT database
"data base"
LOCATION, MAPSET, and CURRENT WINDOW, followed by user options:

.SH DEFINITIONS
.TP
.B Window
A 
.CT "" geographic
window is a grid of rectangles (or cells)
with boundaries (north, south, east, west)
which define the extent of the window,
and 
.CT grid cell
resolutions (north-south, east-west)
which determine the length (in meters) of the edges of the window cells.
The north and south boundaries are called the
.I northings
and increase from south to north.
The east and west boundaries are called the
.I eastings
and increase from west to east.
The north-south and east-west resolutions need not be the
same, thus allowing non-square cells.
.TP
.B Default Window:
Each location has a fixed
.CT "" geographic
window, called the default window, which defines the
extent of the 
.CT "database." "data base."
While this provides a starting point for defining new 
.CT "" geographic
windows,
user-defined 
.CT "" geographic
windows need not fall within this window.
.TP
.B Current Window:
Each mapset has a current 
.CT "" geographic
window.
This 
.CT "" geographic
window defines the area of the 
.CT database "data base"
in which
all viewing and analyses will be done.
Data will be resampled, if necessary,
to the resolutions of the current 
.CT "" geographic
window.
.TP
.B Window Data Base
Each mapset may have any number of predefined named 
.CT "" geographic
windows.
The user may create as many of these 
.CT "" geographic
windows as they
desire. Any of the predefined 
.CT "" geographic
windows may be selected,
by name, to become the current 
.CT "" geographic
window.
.SH WINDOW EDIT PROMPT
Most of the options will require the user to edit a 
.CT "" geographic
window,
be it the current 
.CT "" geographic
window or a 
.CT database "data base"
window.
A standard prompt is used to perform this edit.
An example is shown below:

The fields NORTH EDGE, SOUTH EDGE, WEST EDGE and EAST EDGE
are the boundaries of the 
.CT "" geographic
window which the user can change.
The fields Default North, Default South, Def West and Def East
are the boundaries of the default window which are displayed for
reference and cannot be changed. The GRID RESOLUTION Window
fields are the 
.CT "" geographic
window resolutions which the user can change.
The GRID RESOLUTION Default fields are the resolutions of the
default window which are displayed for reference
and can not be changed.
.SH WINDOW MANAGEMENT OPTIONS
.TP
1 Modify the current geographic window directly
Allows the user to edit the current 
.CT "" geographic
window.
.TP
2 Set current geographic window from default window
Copies the default window to the current 
.CT "" geographic
window,
and then lets the user edit the current 
.CT "" geographic
window.
.TP
3 Set current geographic window from a 
.CT database "data base"
window
Allows the user to select a 
.CT "" geographic
window by name
from the 
.CT database "data base"
of windows to become the current 
.CT "" geographic
window,
and then lets the user edit the current 
.CT "" geographic
window.

Note: windows may be selected from other mapsets as well, depending
on the user's mapset search path.
.TP
4 Set current geographic window from a cell map
Allows the user to select a 
.CT "map layer," "cell map,"
copies the cell
header for this 
.CT layer "cell map"
to the current 
.CT "" geographic
window,
and then lets the user edit the current 
.CT "" geographic
window.
This option is useful when subsequent GRASS operations will
be used to produce a 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
from one input 
.CT "map layer "cell map"
and it is necessary that the result coincide with the input
.CT "layer." "cell map."
.TP
5 Save the current geographic window in the data base
Allows the user to save the current 
.CT "" geographic
window in the window 
.CT database "data base"
of
the current mapset.
This option is useful when the current 
.CT "" geographic
window is set directly using option 2, or
even by another 
.CT GRID GRASS
program (e.g., \fIdisplay[1]\fR).
This option installs an otherwise temporary 
.CT "" geographic
window into the
window 
.CT database "data base"
for recall when needed.
.TP
6 Create a new data base window.
Creates a new 
.CT "" geographic
window in the window 
.CT database "data base"
of the current mapset
using the window edit prompt described above.
After the 
.CT "" geographic
window is created,
the user is asked if this 
.CT "" geographic
window should also be used as the current 
.CT "" geographic
window.
.TP
7 Modify a data base window
Modifies a 
.CT "" geographic
window in the window 
.CT database "data base"
of the current mapset
using the window edit prompt.  After the changes have been made,
the user is asked if this 
.CT "" geographic
window should also be used as the current 
.CT "" geographic
window.
