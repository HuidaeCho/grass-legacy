.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mapsets
.SH DESCRIPTION
The GRASS tool \fImapsets\fR
is an interactive program which allows users to choose which of the
available mapsets they would like to access during the current GRASS
session.

A
.I mapset
is a distinct set of 
.CT maps "map layers"
which a user has created.  At the outset of
every GRASS session, the user identifies a mapset
that is to be the
.I current\ mapset
which will be used to save 
.CT maps "map layers"
created during that session.
.CT Maps "Map layers"
can be added to and deleted from this chosen
mapset.

Usually, there are other
mapsets
created by the user or other users that will contain 
.CT maps "map layers"
of interest
which the user would also like to access.
This program, \fImapsets\fR, allows the user to select which of these
other mapsets to which the user would like access.

The
.I mapsets
command shows the user which mapsets that user currently has access to,
and in what order they will be accessed.  All available mapsets
are listed and the user is given the opportunity to choose a new mapset
search order by using mapset names or numbers.

This search order (also known as the
\fImapset search path\fR)
specifies where and in what order GRASS will search for 
.CT "database files." "data base elements."
When the user enters the name of a map layer in response to a
GRASS program prompt, the first mapset in the list will be scanned
for the 
.CT "map." "map layer."
If the 
.CT map "map layer"
name is found in this mapset, it is used. If the 
.CT map "map layer"
name is not found in the first mapset listed in the search path,
the next mapset in the list is scanned, and so on.  It is common for a user to
have the special mapset
.B PERMANENT
included in the mapset search path.  Often, other mapsets
which contain sets of interpreted 
.CT maps "map layers"
will be likewise included.  Suppose,
for example,
that the mapset
.I Soil_Maps
contains interpreted soils 
.CT maps "map layers"
to which the user
wants access.  The 
mapset
.I Soil_Maps
should then be included in the user's
.I search\ path
variable.
.PP
The
.I mapset\ search\ path
is saved as part of the current 
mapset.
When the user works in that mapset at a later date the previously saved
mapset search path will be used.
.SH NOTES
Although the user may access (and copy) 
.CT maps "map layers"
in another's mapset, the user
can only modify 
.CT maps "map layers"
in mapsets owned by that user.
