.SH SYNOPSIS
.B resample 
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an interactive program to resample a 
.CT "data layer." "cell map."
It reads the user-specified 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
into the
current \fIgeographic window\fR masked by the current
\fImask\fR, and produces a new
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
containing the results of the resampling. The 
.CT data category
values in the new cell 
.CT file map
will be the same as in the original,
except that the resolution and extent of the new 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
will match those of the current 
.CT "" geographic
window.
.SH NOTES
The method by which resampling is conducted is "nearest neighbor"
(see \fIneighbors[1]\fR).  The resulting cell 
.CT file map
will have the same
resolution as the resolution of the current 
.CT "" geographic
window.

The resulting 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
can be identical to the original 
.CT "map layer." "cell map."
The \fIresample\fR program will copy the color table, category file,
and history file associated with the original 
.CT layer "cell map"
for the resulting 
.CT "layer." "cell map."
