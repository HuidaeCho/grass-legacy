.TH access 1
.SH NAME
access \- control access to the current mapset
.SH SYNOPSIS
access
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program allows the user to control access to the current mapset.
Normally any user can read data from any GRASS mapset. But sometimes
it is desirable to prohibit access to certain sensitive data. The
.B access
command allows a user to restrict access to the current mapset.

For example, the user may allow only users in the same UNIX group
to read data files in the mapset. Or the user may restrict the
mapset to personal use only.

The user will be presented with a screen page which reflects the current
mapset permissions. The user can then change them. The screen page looks like:
.TS
box expand tab(|);
lll.
LOCATION: spearfish||MAPSET: demo
.T&
lss.

This program allows you to control access to your mapset by other users.
Access may be granted/removed for everyone, or for everyone in your group.

Mark an 'x' to allow access, erase the field to restrict access.

.T&
lss.

    GROUP: _x_
    OTHER: _x_

.T&
css.

(OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)
.TE

If you remove the x (using the space bar), access will be denied to that
class of user.
If you type an x, access will be granted to that class of user.
.SH BUGS
Under 3.0, access to the mapset PERMANENT must be open to all users.
This is because GRASS looks for the default 
.CT window "geographic window"
and the location
title in files under the PERMANENT mapset.
The
.B access
command,
therefore, will not allow you to restrict access to PERMANENT.

Also, the 
.B mapsets
command isn't smart enough to tell
if access to a specified mapset is restricted. The user is allowed to
include restricted mapsets in the search path. However, the data in the
mapset is still protected. Any attempts to look for or use data in a
restricted mapset will fail. The user will simply not see any data.
