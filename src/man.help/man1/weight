.SH SYNOPSIS
.B weight
.SH DESCRIPTION
The GRASS tool \fIweight\fR is a language-driven weighted 
.CT "" cell
map overlay tool.
Like 
.I combine,
it provides a means for performing geographical analyses using several
.CT "map layers." "cell maps."
The \fIcombine\fR program allows the user to specify
.CT locations cells
using such boolean keywords as AND, OR, and NOT.  Each 
.CT location cell
either does or does not meet the user's specifications.  In \fIcombine\fR,
.CT locations cells
are either good or bad, and each condition is given equal
importance (i.e., an equal weight).
.PP
Conversely, \fIweight\fR
asks the user to weight (assign numeric values to) the 
.CT "" cell
map categories
of interest.  The assignment of \fIweight\fR values requires that the
user intimately understand the analysis being undertaken.  How important
is the slope of the land in comparison with the current land use, or
the depth to bedrock?  The assignment of values to the land's
characteristics allows \fIweight\fR to mix and compare apples and oranges,
such as slopes and land uses, and soil types and vegetation.
.PP
.I Weight
is a language-driven analysis tool.  It responds to 
.XT worded 
commands typed at
the terminal.  Help is always available via the one word command:
\fBhelp\fR.  Commands available in \fIweight\fR are listed below.

Note that 
.CT "" cell
map names appear in parentheses. The use of parentheses
is now optional in \fIweight\fR.

.SH SUGGESTED APPROACH
In order for 
.I weight 
to generate 
.CT "" cell
maps useful for analysis, the user must make a reasonable
and defensible request.  While much more powerful than \fIcombine\fR,
\fIweight\fR is also more dangerous.  The user provides the necessary
value judgements which are registered as weights.  Only well-conceived
value judgements will result in defensible results.  We suggest the
following approach to a weighted overlay analysis:

.nf
STEP 1: BEFORE RUNNING WEIGHT
        a) Define the question to be answered.  e.g., "Locate 
           sites suitable for building apartments."
        b) Determine what mapped information is useful for 
           answering the question.  e.g., geology, soils,
           land_use, flood_potential.
        c) Based on professional judgement, statistical 
           inference, and engineering principals, assign 
           weights to the categories in the chosen cell maps.
STEP 2: CHOOSE CELL MAPS
        In \fIweight\fR, use the command \fIchoose\fR to identify 
        up to six cell maps of interest.
STEP 3: ASSIGN WEIGHTS
        Using the \fIweight\fR command \fIassign\fR, assign
        specific weights to cell map categories.
STEP 4: SAVE ANALYSIS
        Use the \fIsave\fR command to save a copy of the analysis 
        requested for later use.
STEP 5: RUN ANALYSIS
        Use \fIexecute\fR to run the analysis.
STEP 6: EVALUATE RESULTS
        To modify an existing analysis request, use the \fIrecover\fR
        command to retrieve the analysis and then go to STEP 3.
