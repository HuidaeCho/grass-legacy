.SH NAME
reclass \- Create new cell 
.CT layer map
based upon existing cell 
.CT layer map
.br
.I (Available through
.B grass3
.I menu)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B reclass
.SH DESCRIPTION
The GRASS program
.I reclass
allows a user to create a new 
.CT "grid cell data layer" "cell map"
based upon a category
reclassification of an existing 
.CT "data layer." "cell map."
This new 
.CT layer "cell map"
will be a
reclassification of the original 
.CT "" cell
map, based upon the information the user
provided using the \fIreclass\fR program.

Before using \fIreclass\fR one must know the following:


.IP 1
The new categories desired; and, which old categories fit into 
which new categories.
.IP 2
The 
.CT names labels
of the new categories.

.SH EXAMPLE
Suppose we want to reclassify the cell 
.CT file map
"roads" consisting of five
categories into the three new categories:  paved roads, unpaved roads,
and railroad tracks.  The following screen lists the categories of the
"roads" cell 
.CT file map
to be reclassified and prompts the user for the new
category 
.CT numbers values
to be assigned them.

.CT Data Cells
assigned to category 
.CT numbers values
2, 3, and
4 in the old 
.CT "" cell
map are now assigned the new category 
.CT number value
2 in the reclassed
.CT "" cell
map;  
.CT data cells
formerly assigned to 
.CT number value
5 in the old 
.CT "" cell
map is now assigned
the new category 
.CT number value
3 in the reclassed 
.CT "" cell
map.

Based upon the information supplied by the user in the above sample screens,
the new cell map, supporting category, color, history, and header files are created.
.SH NOTE
In fact, the \fIreclass\fR program does \fInot\fR generate any new 
.CT "" cell
maps
(in the interests of disk space conservation).  Instead, a
\fBreclass table\fR is stored which will be used to reclassify the
original 
.CT "" cell
map each time the new (reclassed) 
.CT "" cell
map name is requested.  As far
as the user (and programmer) is concerned, that 
.CT "" cell
map has been created.  Also
note that although the user can generate a \fIreclass\fR 
.CT "" cell
map which is based
on another \fIreclass\fR 
.CT "" cell
map, the new \fIreclass\fR 
.CT "" cell
map will be stored in
GRASS as a \fIreclass\fR of the \fIoriginal\fR 
.CT "" cell
map.  Therefore, while
GRASS allows the user to provide \fIreclass\fR 
.CT layer "cell map"
information which is
based on an already reclassified 
.CT "" cell
map (for the user's convenience), no
\fIreclass\fR 
.CT "" cell
map (i.e., \fIreclass table\fR) will ever be \fIstored\fR
as a \fIreclass\fR of a \fIreclass\fR.
.SH BEWARE
Because \fIreclass\fR generates a table referencing some original 
.CT "" cell
map
rather than creating a reclassed 
.CT "" cell
map, a \fIreclass\fR "cell map"
will no longer be accessible if the original 
.CT "" cell
map upon which it was based
is later removed.
.SH NOTES
To convert a reclass 
.CT file "cell map"
to a regular cell 
.CT "file," "map,"
set your 
.CT "" geographic
window to
match the header for the reclass 
.CT file "cell map"
and then run resample.
