.TH report 1
.SH NAME
report \- Reports statistics for 
.CT "grid cell files" "cell maps"
.br
.I (Available through
.B grass3
.I menu)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B report
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIreport\fR program
allows the user to set up a series of report parameters which can then be
applied to a 
.CT "map layer." "cell map."
It will create a report for this 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
based on these parameters.
The user has the option of printing out each report and/or saving the report
in a file for future reference.

The user is first asked to specify the units in which the statistics gathered
shall be reported (multiple units can be reported).  Here, the user has
seven options:

.nf
.in +.5i
# cells in area of interest
% cover (including no data areas)
% cover (excluding no data areas)
cover measured in acres
cover measured in hectares
cover measured in square kilometers
cover measured in square miles
.in -.5i
.fi

These units are based on the number of cells in the user's
\fIarea of interest\fR, which is the combination of the current 
.I "geographic window"
and the current
.I mask
(if any).
These are established with the programs
.I window
and
.I mask,
respectively.

The report itself consists of two parts:  a header section, and the main
body of the report.

The header section of the report identifies the 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
(by name and
title), location, mapset, report date, and the area of interest.  The
area of interest is described in two parts:  the user's current 
.CT "" geographic
window is
presented, and the masking 
.CT layer "cell map"
is presented (if one was used).

The main body of the report consists of from one to three tables
which present the statistics for
each category and the totals for each unit column.
Note that, unlike the GRASS tool \fIcell.stats\fR, \fIreport\fR allows
the user to select the specific units of measure in which statistics
will be reported.
Following is the result of a
.I report
run on the Spearfish sample 
.CT database "data base"
cell 
.CT file map
"geology", with the units
expressed in both square miles and acres.
