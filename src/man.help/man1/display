.SH SYNOPSIS
.B display
.SH DESCRIPTION
The GRASS tool \fIdisplay\fR is used to display maps on a graphics
monitor and prepare final map products for printing.  The \fID\fR
language program \fIDscreen\fR should be run by the user before each run
of \fIdisplay\fR to prepare the screen for graphics.
After invoking the command \fBdisplay\fR, the DISPLAY MAIN MENU appears
on the monitor.  Options in this and subsequent \fIdisplay\fR menus are
selected through use of the pointing device (mouse).  When the mouse cursor
is over the desired menu selection, the user simply presses any button
on the mouse.
In the DISPLAY MAIN MENU, the user is given the choice of selecting one
of the following options: \fI
.br
.sp
DISPLAY MAIN MENU
.br
map display
.br
digitize
.br

.br
hide menu for 10 seconds
.br

.sp
Selection of the \fImap display\fR option leads to the presentation of
the DISPLAY MAP MENU below: \fI

Several of the \fIDISPLAY MAP MENU\fR choices shown above are essentially
equivalent to \fID\fR language commands.  However, in many cases, the
\fID\fR commands give the user greater flexibility and make available more
options than are available through the \fIdisplay\fR menus.  For example,
the \fIlabel file\fR option
runs the \fIDlabel\fR command using defaults.  Users running \fIDlabel\fR
directly from the command line have the choice of stipulating specific
label background and text colors, as well as text sizes and font types.
Users running the \fIlabel file\fR option through \fIdisplay\fR cannot
specify these options; instead, default values are used (see
\fIDlabel(2D)\fR for default values used).
.br
Similarly, the \fIcell map 2-d\fR option available through \fIdisplay\fR
runs like the \fID\fR command \fIDcell(2D)\fR;  the \fIvect map 2-d\fR
option is similar to the \fIDvect(2D)\fR command; the \fIsite map 2-d\fR
option runs like 
.CT "\fIDsites(2D)\fR;" "Gsites piped through Dpoints;"
the \fIscale display 2-d\fR option runs
\fIDscale(2D)\fR using default values; the \fImeasurements 2-d\fR option
runs \fIDmeasure(2D)\fR; the \fIcolor interact\fR option presents the
same menu that \fId.colors\fR does; the \fIlegend\fR option runs
\fIDlegend(2D)\fR using default values; and the \fIcell map 3-d\fR
option presents the same menu as is presented by \fId.3d(1)\fR.
The \fIdisplay\fR tool is best learned by playing with its options.
Refer to the individual \fID\fR and \fId\fR commands discussed above
for a detailed examination of these tools.  A brief explanation of
DISPLAY MAP MENU options follows:
.sp
\fICell Map 2-d\fR - Displays a 
.CT "cell file map layer." "cell map."
You will
be asked for the name of the cell 
.CT file map
you wish to display.  On the
monitor the map legend, title, location, 
.CT "window," "geographic window,"
cell size, the
GRASS logo, and a reduced version of the entire 
.CT map "cell map"
indicating the
.CT location position
of the current 
.CT map geographic
window will also be shown, in small 
.CT windows "display windows"
surrounding the 
.CT window "display window"
in which the cell 
.CT file map
is displayed.
.sp
\fIVect Map 2-d\fR - Vector versions of some maps may be available for
use as base map overlays.  Select the \fIvect map 2-d\fR option.
You will then be prompted for the vector map desired as a line 
overlay.  You are also given a choice of colors in which vectors will
be displayed.
.sp
\fILabel File 2-d\fR - Labels are placed on the map using the
\fIlabel file 2-d\fR option.  You are asked to locate where the label
is to be placed using the mouse, and are then prompted to type in the
desired text.  Be careful with this option as labels are not removable.
.sp
\fISite Map 2-d\fR - This option allows the user to display 
.CT "site files" "site maps"
on the monitor.  You will be asked for the name of the site 
.CT file map
you wish to display.
.sp
\fIScale Display 2-d\fR - This option will cause a map scale to be
placed at the top of the map currently displayed there.
.sp
\fIMeasurements 2-d\fR - Use of this option will allow you to draw
lines on the screen, and calculate their lengths and areas.
.sp
\fIColor Interact\fR - This option will allow the user to select or
modify a color table to be associated with the displayed 
.CT map "cell map"
(see
\fId.colors(1)\fR for specific options).  If the user saves this color
table, it will be associated with the 
.CT map "cell map"
in subsequent runs of
\fIdisplay\fR and \fIpaint(1)\fR.
.sp
\fILegend\fR - This option will display a legend in a 
.CT window "display window"
to the
left of the displayed 
.CT "map." "cell map."
Using the mouse the user can opt to display
a legend with, or without, text.
.sp
\fICell Map 3-d\fR - Use of this option will provide the user with a
three-dimensional view of the map area bounded by the current 
.CT "window." "geographic window."
Default inputs are provided to the user;  however, the user can alter
these inputs.
.sp
\fIRETURN\fR - will cause you to exit the DISPLAY MAP MENU, and return
to the DISPLAY MAIN MENU.
.sp 2
From the DISPLAY MAIN MENU, the user can select the \fIdigitize\fR option.
This option leads the user to the same mouse button menu provided by
the \fId.digit\fR command, and allows the performance of on-screen
digitizing.  The user is asked whether a line, area, or circle is to
be drawn, and the category 
.CT number value
to be associated with the feature. By
drawing a series of such features the user can repair 
.CT "maps," "cell maps,"
identify areas
of interest, interpret aerial photographs and satellite images, or simply
draw graphics for advertisement.  When drawing is completed, a 
.XT grid 
cell
map based on the user's instructions is generated.  It is available for use
as a mask, in analyses, and for display.
.sp 2
The \fIwindow\fR option is also available from the DISPLAY MAIN MENU.
Using the mouse, the user can choose to \fBzoom in\fR on a portion of the
displayed cell 
.CT file map
to create a smaller 
.CT map geographic
window.  Once the user has
defined the corners of this area using the mouse, the smaller area
is enlarged and replotted on the screen.  The user can similarly choose
to \fBzoom out\fR.  In this case, the user uses the mouse to encompass
that portion of the reduced map that the user wishes to make the
current 
.CT map geographic
window and display in the center of the screen.  The larger
map is then replotted and displayed.  Finally, the user can enter
.CT "window coordinates" "map coordinates for the window"
from the keyboard using the GRASS command 
.B window.
This is done by selecting the \fBtype coordinates\*R option.
.sp 2
The main menu also offers the user the option of hiding the main menu
for ten seconds (\fIhide menu for 10 seconds\fR).
Finally, to exit \fIdisplay\fR, the user may select the \fIQUIT\fR option
with the mouse.  If selected, the user is asked whether this is really
desired.
.SH NOTES
The \fIdisplay\fR command must be run in conjunction with a program which
converts the GRASS graphics commands generated by \fIdisplay\fR,
to the graphics commands that the current device understands.  This device
will almost always be a graphics monitor.  On most systems the user is
required to start up this other program separately from (and prior to)
\fIdisplay\fR.
In such cases, a locally-defined program, usually "monitor", is used
(see your GRASS manager).  (For example, on MASSCOMP machines, the
\fImonitor\fR program must be running in the foreground on the graphics monitor.
On SUN machines, the \fImonitor\fR program can be started from any terminal
and run in the background.)
.sp
If you are running the quick-access (non-menu) version of GRASS
(accessed through the command \fBGRASS3\fR),
you may use the \fID\fR language commands \fIDnew\fR and \fIDchoose\fR
to create and choose a smaller 
.CT window "display window"
on the graphics 
.CT device monitor
for the
\fIdisplay\fR program to use.
.SH NOTES
The tool \fIdisplay\fR should be phased out in favor of the various \fID\fR
language commands.
