.SH NAME
paint \- Interface to color hardcopy output.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B paint
.br
.I (Available through
.B grass3
.I menu)
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIpaint\fR program
is an interface to routines which perform various functions
related to producing a hardcopy map on your system's color printer.
(Note that the user must first have selected a printer before a map can
be painted. See the \fBpaint select\fR function below or the \fIPselect[2P]\fR
manual entry for further information on the selection of printers.)

The user will be presented the following menu and asked to select one of the
the following functions:

.TS
l l l.
	\fImap\fR	(to paint a map)
	\fIchart\fR	(to paint the printer color chart)
	\fIcolors\fR	(to modify the color table for a cell map)
	\fIicons\fR	(to create or modify an icon file for paint map)
	\fIlabels\fR	(to create or modify a labels file for paint map)
	\fIselect\fR	(to select a paint output device)
		
	\fIexit\fR	(to exit from paint)
.TE

.SH PAINT MAP
This function produces a hardcopy color map of a user-specified 
.CT "data layer." "cell map."
The user will be asked for the following (in illustration, example inputs
have been provided):
.nf

.ne 12
\fBCELL\fR
Do you want to paint a cell map? (y/n) \fBy\fR

.RS
Enter the name of an existing cell map
Enter \fBlist\fR for a list of existing cell maps
Enter \fBlist -f\fR for a list with titles
Hit \fBRETURN\fR to cancel request
> \fBsoils\fR
.RE
.fi

(If no cell 
.CT file map
is requested, a completely white map will be produced. It
can be useful to select no cell 
.CT file map
in order to get a white background for
vector, site or label images.)
.nf

.ne 12
\fBCOLORMODE\fR
select the method for coloring the map

.RS
1.  normal map
2.  image (Landsat, NHAP, etc.)
> \fB1\fR
.RE
.fi

(Paint has two different ways to color the raster output. The
.I normal
method is good for true maps, like soils. The 
.I image
method is good for Landsat scenes, NHAP photos, etc., since it
blends colors across pixels to give a more "picture-like"
output.)
.nf

.ne 14
\fBVECTOR\fR
Do you want to paint any vector maps? (y/n) \fBy\fR

.RS
Enter the name of an existing vector map
Enter \fBlist\fR for a list of existing vector maps
Hit \fBRETURN\fR to cancel request
> \fBroads\fR

select a color for \fIvectormap\fR: \fBred\fR

enter line width for \fIvectormap\fR: \fB3\fR

do you want to paint any more vector maps? (y/n) \fBn\fR
.RE

.ne 20
\fBSITES\fR

Enter \fBlist\fR for a list of existing site maps
Hit \fBRETURN\fR to cancel request
> \fBwindmills\fR

select a color for \fIsitemap\fR: \fBblue\fR

please enter an icon file for \fIsitemap\fR
Enter \fBlist\fR for a list of existing icon files
Hit \fBRETURN\fR to select \fBDEFAULT\fR icon
> \fBwindmills\fR (icons are created by user, see \fBPAINT ICONS\fR below)

enter icon size: \fB3\fR (means 3X larger than icon in icon file)

should the site labels be printed as well? (y/n) \fBn\fR

Hit \fBRETURN\fR to cancel request
> \fBtown.names\fR

do you want to paint any more labels files? (y/n) \fBn\fR
.RE
.fi

(A label file is created by \fBpaint labels\fR (see below) and contains text 
that will appear on the image.)

.nf
.ne 9
\fBSCALE\fR
enter map scale: \fB1panel\fR
.RS

The scale can be selected either as:
1) a relative ratio, e.g., 1:25000
2) an absolute width of the printed image, e.g., 10 inches.
3) the number of printed paper panels, e.g., 3 panels.
4) the number of miles per inch, e.g., 1 inch equals 4 miles.
(RETURN alone will give help for entering the scale.)

.RE
.ne 9
\fBGRID\fR
would you like a coordinate grid? (y/n) \fBy\fR

.RS
enter grid spacing in meters: \fB1000\fR

would you like the grid numbered? (y/n) \fBy\fR
.RE
.fi

(Grid lines are painted in black and are numbered (if desired) every line with 
black numbers.)

.nf
.ne 13
\fBLEGEND\fR
would you like a full color table included in the legend? (y/n) \fBy\fR

do you have any comments to be included in the legend? (y/n) \fBy\fR
enter comments line by line. type \fBend\fR when complete.
if you have comments in a file, type\ \ \fB<filename\fR
> \fBThis is a comment.\fR
> \fBend\fR
.fi

(The color table will display the colors for each category of a cell 
.CT file map
and
the category description. Comments are text which is to appear in the legend
(after the last panel). Comments may be typed in directly or by submitting a
previously prepared UNIX file.)

.SH PAINT CHART
This function allows the user to paint the colors that the current selected 
printer is capable of generating along with the (device-dependent) number 
associated with each color.  This function is useful for the \fBpaint colors\fR 
function of \fIpaint\fR.
.SH PAINT COLORS
This function allows the user to modify a color table for a 
.CT "data cell layer," "cell map,"
assigning colors to the categories in the 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
based on printer
color numbers (instead of red, green, blue percentages).  

The user will need to have the printer color chart available to properly select
the colors (see \fBpaint chart\fR above).

The \fIcolors\fR function allows the user to exercise perfect control over
the colors which appear in the hardcopy image.
.SH PAINT LABELS
This function allows the user to create (and modify)
text labels for use with the
\fIpaint map\fR, \fIPmap[2P]\fR, and \fIDpaint.labels[2D]\fR
functions.
The labels files are kept in the current mapset. 
Each label has components which determine the text,
the location of the text on the image, its size, and the background
for the text. The user will be prompted for these components as follows:

\fBTEXT\fR:
Up to four lines of text.
Lines in multiple line labels will appear one above the next.

\fBSKIP\fR:
yes/no. If \fIno\fR, label will be printed.
If \fIyes\fR, the label will be retained in the file but not printed.

\fBLOCATION\fR:
Determines where the text will be located on the image.
The user specifies the easting and northing, and (optionally) specifies
a vertical and horizontal offset (in printer pixels) from the
specified easting/northing. (The vertical offset will shift the location
to the south if positive, north if negative. The horizontal offset
will shift the location east if positive, west if negative.) These
offsets are provided to allow finer placement of labels.

\fBPLACEMENT\fR:
Determines which part of the label to which the location refers.
This may be specified as:

.TS
l l l.
	lower left	(lower left corner of the text)
	lower right	(lower right corner of the text)
	lower center	(bottom center of the text)

	upper left	(upper left corner of the text)
	upper right	(upper right corner of the text)
	upper center	(top center of the text)

	center	(center of the text)
.TE

\fBFONT\fR:
This specifies the font to use. The following fonts are available:

.in +3
.ll -3
cyrilc gothgbt gothgrt gothitt greekc greekcs greekp greeks
italicc italiccs italict romanc romancs romand romans romant
scriptc scripts
.in -3
.ll +3

The word
.I standard
can be used to specify the default font (which is romans).

\fBTEXT SIZE\fR:
This determines the size of the letters. The size specifies
the vertical height of the letters in meters
on the ground. Thus text will
grow or shrink depending on the scale at which the map is drawn.

\fBTEXT COLOR\fR:
This selects the text color.
This color can be specified in one of four ways:

.in +3
.ti -3
1) By color name:
.br
.ll -3
aqua black blue brown cyan gray green grey indigo
magenta orange purple red violet white yellow

.ll +3
.ti -3
2) As red, green, blue percentages.
for example: .5 .4 .7
.br
(This form is not supported by \fIDpaint.labels[2D]\fR.)

.ti -3
3) By printer color number to get the exact printer color.
.br
(This form is not supported by \fIDpaint.labels[2D]\fR.)

.ti -3
4) Specify
\fInone\fR
to suppress the lettering.
.in

\fBWIDTH\fR:
This determines the line thickness of the letters.
The normal text width should be set to 1.  Larger numbers
can be used to simulate bold face. (\fIDpaint.labels[2D]\fR ignores
this value and always uses 1.)

\fBHIGHLIGHT COLOR\fR:
The text can be highlighted in another color so that it appears to be
in two colors. The text is drawn first in this color at a wider line
width, and then redrawn in the text color at the regular line width.
Specify
\fInone\fR
for no highlight.
(See TEXT COLOR above for a list of colors).

\fBHIGHLIGHT WIDTH\fR:
Specifies how far from the text lines (in pixels) the highlight
color should extend.

\fBBACKGROUND COLOR\fR:
Text may be boxed in
a solid color by specifying a background
color.
Specify
\fInone\fR
for no background.
(See TEXT COLOR above for a list of colors).

\fBOPAQUE TO VECTORS\fR:
\fIyes/no\fR. This field only has meaning if a background color is selected.
\fIyes\fR will prevent vector lines from entering the background.
\fIno\fR will allow vector lines to enter the background.

\fBBORDER COLOR\fR:
Select a color for the border around the background.
Specify
\fInone\fR
to suppress the border.
(See TEXT COLOR above for a list of colors).
.SH PAINT ICONS
Allows the user to create and maintain icons which are used by the
\fIpaint map\fR function and \fIPmap[2P]\fR command to depict 
.CT "site or point data." "sites."
.SH PAINT SELECT
The \fIpaint\fR system supports multiple color printers.
Before the user can paint anything, the user must select an output device
(even if the system has only one paint device).
The \fIselect\fR option will show the user the available devices,
which device (if any) is currently selected,
and ask the user to select a device.
For example, if the user currently does not have a device selected,
the below response will appear:

.RS
No PAINTER currently selected

Available PAINTERS

abc xyz

Select a driver, or hit RETURN to quit> 
.RE

If the user has already selected a device, but invokes the \fIpaint select\fR
option in order to alter the selection of devices, the below response
will appear:

.RS
Currently selected PAINTER: xyz

Available PAINTERS

abc xyz

Hit RETURN to continue, or select new driver>
