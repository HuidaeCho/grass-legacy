.SH NAME
prune \- Perform pruning on vector 
.CT file map
.br
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B prune
.SH DESCRIPTION
The GRASS tool
.I prune
allows the user to remove extra points from a vector 
.CT "file." "map."
This allows one to reduce disk space required by a vector 
.CT file map
and
still have data accuracy within a given tolerance.
.br
The user is propted for three items: input vector 
.CT "file," "map,"
new output vector 
.CT "file," "map,"
and threshold at which to prune.
This threshold value
is the same as the digit[1] pruning threshold.  This is specified in 
.CT database "data base"
units (e.g., in meters for UTM).  The threshold can also be
specified in inches on the map, and the program will convert these
to 
.CT database "data base"
units using the \fIscale\fR in the vector 
.CT "file." "map."
To differentiate
between the two, you must specifiy inches by typing the letter 'i' immediately
following the threshold value (e.g.,  0.04i).
The input map will be read and the resultant pruned map will be placed
into a newly created output map, leaving the original map unchanged.  The 
pruning algorithm throws away redundant points within the specified threshold.
It works on each digitized line separately, from node to node.  It does
not change the position or number of nodes.
