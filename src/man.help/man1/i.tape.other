.SH NAME
.IP i.tape.other\ \- 15
An imagery function that extracts scanned aerial imagery (NHAP, etc.)
and SPOT imagery from half inch tape
.br
.I (GRASS Imagery Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B i.tape.other
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I i.tape.other
is a generic program that extracts imagery from tape using the tape
description that is input by the user.

This program must be run in a LOCATION with a x,y coordinate
system (i.e., a coordinate system with projection 0).
For further information regarding 
this LOCATION refer to the manual entry \fIimagery[5]\fR.

The first prompt in \fIi.tape.other\fR asks the user for the 
tape device name.  This is sometimes  /dev/rmt0 (for a density of 1600),
but this varies with each machine.

The next prompt is:
.if t \fB
.nf
Please mount and load tape, then hit RETURN -->
.fi

.SH IMAGE IDENTIFICATION MENU
The first menu in the program asks the user for information about the data.

.IP "\fInumber of tape files to be skipped\fR"
If there are files at the beginning of the tape which are not
image data, they can be skipped. Sometimes information that comes
with a tape will indicate the number of header files or records
on the tape.  The GRASS utility \fIexamine.tape\fR will also
provide this information.  The \fIrecord length\fR is the number of
columns in the image, while the \fInumber of records\fR is the number
of rows in the image.  NHAP imagery and usually 
most scanned aerial imagery do not have tape header files, but this
should be checked.
SPOT imagery has two files that should be skipped on the first tape,
and one file to be skipped on the second tape (of a two-tape set).
.IP "\fInumber of records in the remaining files to be skipped\fR"
If the files which contain the image begin with non-image data, these
records can also be skipped.
This is usually 0 for most data types.  SPOT imagery stored in 1600bpi
has one header record in the image file on each tape that should be skipped.
.IP "\fInumber of bands on the tape\fR"
Most aerial imagery have 3 bands, but satellite simulator data may have
more.  SPOT has 3 bands as a standard.
The total number of bands on the tape should be specified here, not just 
the number that will be extracted.
.IP "\fIdata format\fR"
The two formats that imagery data are most commonly stored in are 
called \fIband interleaved\fR format (BIL) and \fIband sequential\fR
format (BSQ).
In BIL format, each record on the tape contains one line for one band
of data.  If the data contains three bands, then the first five records
will look like this:  
.nf
.ce 5

band 1, line 1
band 2, line 1
band 3, line 1
band 1, line 2
band 2, line 2

.fi
In BSQ format, all lines of one band are stored together on a
tape, followed by all lines of another band, followed by all
lines of the next band, etc.  These data are stored as if they
were in a one band BIL format:

.nf 12
.ce 12
band 1, line 1
band 1, line 2
band 1, line 3
     .
     .
     .
band 2, line 1
band 2, line 2
     .
     .
band 2, line 156
band 2, line 157
.fi

Each pixel contains one byte and there
is one line per record.  BSQ format is the format that is 
usually created by optical scanning devices when they scan 
photographs, but not all digitized aerial imagery are stored in this
format.  The format of the data is usually written on the 
exterior of the tape;  this should be checked.
.IP "\fIlength (in bytes) of the longest record on the tape\fR"
This must be set to the number of bytes in the longest data record.
It is used to determine how large a buffer to use for reading the
tape. This value can be obtained using
.I examine.tape.
.SH BAND EXTRACTION MENU
The user is then asked to mark an \fIx\fR beside the bands to be
extracted.  See the subheading in this entry entitled ROW AND
COLUMN EXTRACTION.

.if t \fB
.ce 1
please mark an x by the bands you want extracted

.nf
.ce 4

_____2
_____3

.fi
.ce 2

.SH PREFIX/GROUP NAME
The user is asked to enter the prefix/group for the band cell 
.CT files maps
to be created.  This name will precede each band 
.CT file "cell map"
extracted into GRASS.  For example, if 3 bands are extracted 
the following 3 band 
.CT files "cell maps"
will result:

.ce 3
.I prefixname.1
.br
.I prefixname.2
.br
.I prefixname.3

The specified \fIprefixname\fR
will also automatically become the name for the imagery group 
file being created.  Each image (i.e., each run of \fIi.tape.other)\fR
should be given a unique prefix/group name.
.SH ROW AND COLUMN MENU
Finally, the starting row, ending row, starting column and ending
column are required. This allows the user to extract any subset of the
image from the tape.

.if t \fB
.ce 2
EXTRACT
please select desired tape window to extract
.nf
.ce 2

start row:_0_
  end row:_0_

.fi
.nf
.ce 2

start col:_0_
  end col:_0_

.fi


.ce 2
AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
(OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)\fR

The extraction process will begin by first skipping the number
of specified files, advancing to the starting row, and then reading
the tape.  The percent completion of the extraction is displayed
on the screen.

Following the extraction,
the extracted band 
.CT files "cell maps"
will be listed as cell 
.CT files maps
available in the 
current MAPSET. These 
.CT files "cell maps"
may be displayed individually using the 
GRASS commands \fIdisplay\fR, \fIDcell\fR or \fIi.points\fR.
.SH NOTES
After extracting an image from tape, the 
.CT "" geographic
window in the x,y coordinate LOCATION will be set, based upon the 
extracted rows and columns from the tape. The relationship between
the image rows and columns and the 
.CT "" geographic
window 
.CT "" map
coordinates is discussed in 
the manual entry \fIimagery[5]\fR.

.SH ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION
The display options in 
.CT "GRASS-GRID" "GRASS"
allow the user to locate rows and
columns on the digital image.  If enough disk space is available, one
band of an entire image, or one band of a portion of an image known to 
contain the area of interest, can be extracted and displayed.  The 
.I measurements 
option in \fIdisplay\fR, or \fIDwhere\fR (following a run of \fIDcell\fR)
will echo x and y coordinates to the screen.  (These coordinates will display
negative numbers in the north-south direction but ignoring the negative
sign will yield the row number.  See the manual entry \fIimagery[5]\fR for
further explanation.)

If a photograph of the digital image is available, the rows and columns
to be extracted can be determined from it by associating inches with the 
total number of known rows and columns in the scene.  For example, if 
the total length of the photograph is 12 inches, the total number of rows
on the tape is 2000, and the northwest corner of the area of interest 
begins 2 inches from the top of the photo, then:

.ce 2
12" / 2000 rows = 2" / x rows
x = 333.333

The northwest corner of the area of interest starts at row 333.  The
starting row, ending row, starting column, and ending column can be 
calculated in this manner.
