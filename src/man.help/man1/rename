.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rename
.SH DESCRIPTION
The GRASS program
.I rename
allows the user to rename 
.CT "data files" "data base elements"
in the current \fImapset\fR.
The user first selects the type of 
.CT "data file" "data base element" 
.XT "(i.e., the data element)"
to be renamed, from among the following choices:

.RS
.TP 12
\ \ 1
cell maps
.TP 12
\ \ 2
vector maps    
.TP 12
\ \ 3
paint icon files
.TP 12
\ \ 4
paint label files
.TP 12
\ \ 5
site maps
.TP 12
\ \ 6
window files
.TP 12
\ \ 7

RETURN
exit
.RE

.PP
Once the data element type is selected, 
the user is prompted for 
.CT "a file" "an element"
to be renamed.
Then the user is prompted for the new name for the 
.CT "file." "element."
After both names have been entered, the \fIrename\fR is executed and
the user is once again prompted for 
.CT "a file" "an element"
to be renamed.

When prompted for 
.CT file element
names,
the user may enter \fBlist\fR to see a list of existing 
.CT "files," "elements,"
or hit RETURN to get back to the above menu.
.SH NOTE
If 
.CT "a data element file" "an element"
has support files (e.g., cell maps),
\fIrename\fR also automatically renames these support files upon
execution.
