.SH NAME
grow \- Generate output 
.CT layer "cell map"
with contiguous areas grown by one 
.CT pixel cell

.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Grow
generates an output 
.CT layer "cell map"
from the input 
.CT layer "cell map"
by
adding one cell around the perimeter of areas.
An area consists of
any contiguous clump of 
.XT grid 
cells with non-zero category
values.  No distinction is made between differing
category values within an area.  Rather, a border is
grown around the outside of the entire contiguous set
of non-zero 
.XT grid 
cells.

The output 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
will not go outside of the
current 
.CT "" geographic
window.  Thus, if a contiguous area in the input 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
extends to the edge of the current 
.CT "" geographic
window, no
new border cells can be added to that side of the area.

Growth around a rectangular area in the input 
.CT layer "cell map"
will
occur straight out from each edge, but not diagonally
from the corners of the rectangle.  Thus, the "grown"
border area will contain lines along the edge of the
original rectangle, but the corners of the border will not
be squared off.  Instead, the lines
of the border which go along each side of the original rectangle
will touch only at the corners of the 
.XT grid 
cells at the end of
each line.

The user is given the option of creating an output
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
which is completely zero-one, regardless of
category values in the input 
.CT "layer." "cell map."
In this case, 
all 
.XT grid 
cells with a non-zero 
.CT "" category
value in the input 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
are assigned to category 1 in the output 
.CT "map layer." "cell map."
If the user does not choose this option, these 
.XT grid 
cells will retain their original
non-zero category value.  In either case, all 
.XT grid 
cells
whose category value is changed from 0 during the growing
process are given a category value of 1.

The \fIgrow\fR command is useful in representing the boundary
of one or more areas.  
.CT IN In
this case, the zero-one output option should NOT
be used. Then the input 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
can be subtracted from
the output 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
using the \fIGmapcalc\fR command.  All
original 
.CT "non-zero grid cell values" "cells with non-zero category value"
will be subtracted out,
leaving the boundary areas only.  This resulting zero-one
boundary depiction can be displayed over other related 
.CT "map layers" "cell maps"
using \fIDoverlay\fR.
.SH NOTES
If the resolution of the current 
.CT "" geographic
window does not agree with the
resolution of the input 
.CT "map layer," "cell map,"
unintended resampling of
the original 
.CT data "cell map"
may occur.  The user should be sure that
the current 
.CT "" geographic
window is set properly.
