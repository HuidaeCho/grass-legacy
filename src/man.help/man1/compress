.SH SYNOPSIS
.B compress
.I map_layer
.SH DESCRIPTION
The GRASS tool
.I compress
reformats 
.XT grid 
cell 
.CT files maps
using a run-length-encoding (RLE) algorithm.

.CT Maps "Cell maps"
which contain very little information (such as boundary, geology,
soils and land use 
.CT "maps)" "cell maps)"
can be greatly reduced in size.  Some 
.CT maps "cell maps"
are
shrunk to roughly 1% of their original sizes.  
.CT Maps "Cell maps"
containing complex
images such as elevation and photo or satellite images may increase slightly
in size.  GRASS uses a new compressed format, and all new cell
.CT files maps
are now automatically stored in compressed form (see FORMATS below).
GRASS programs read both the compressed and regular formats. 

As an example, the Spearfish 
.CT database "data base"
.CT file "cell map file"
"owner" was originally a size
of 26600 bytes. After it was compressed, the 
.CT file "cell map file"
became only 1249 bytes.
.CT Files "Cell maps"
may be decompressed to return them to their original format. If
.I compress
is asked to work on a 
.CT file "cell map"
which is already compressed, it simply
informs the user of that, and leaves the 
.CT file "cell map"
as it is.

The GRASS command \fBdecompress\fR \fImap_layer\fR
returns the specified 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
to its decompressed format. As with
.I compress,
\fIdecompress[1]\fR will not bother an already decompressed 
.CT "file." "cell map."
.PP
.SH FORMATS
Conceptually a 
.CT "grid cell" "cell map"
consists of rows of cells, with each row containing
the same number of cells. A cell consists of one or more bytes.
The number of bytes per cell depends on the 
.CT data category
values in the 
.CT "grid cell." "cell map."
.CT Data "Category values"
in the range 0-255 require 1 byte per cell, while 
.CT data "category values"
in the range
256-65535 require 2 bytes, and 
.CT data "category values"
in the range above 65535 require 3
(or more) bytes per cell.
.PP
The
.B decompressed
.CT "grid cell" "cell map" 
format matches the conceptual format.
For example, a 
.CT map "cell map"
with 1 byte cells that is 100 rows with 200 cells per row,
consists of 20,000 bytes.
The UNIX command "ls -l" on this file will show a size of 20,000. 
If the cells were 2 byte cells, the file would require 40,000 bytes.
The 
.CT "map data" "cell map category values"
start with the upper left corner cell followed by the other cells
along the northern boundary.  The byte following the last byte of that first
row is the first cell of the second row of 
.CT data "category values"
(moving from left to right).
There are no end-of-row markers or other syncing codes in the 
.CT "data." "cell map."
A cell
header file, \fIcellhd\fR, is used to define how this string of bytes is
broken up into rows of 
.CT "data." "category values."
.PP
The
.B compressed
format is not so simple, but is quite elegant in its design.  It not only
requires less disk space to store the 
.CT "data," "cell map,"
but often can result in faster execution
of graphic and analysis programs since there is less disk i/o. There are two
compressed formats:  the pre-3.0 format
(which GRASS programs can read but no longer produce),
and the 3.0 format
(which is automatically used when new cell 
.CT files maps
are created).

Pre-3.0 format:
.RS
.sp
.ti -.5i
First 3 bytes (chars) - These are a special code that identifies
the 
.CT file "cell map"
as compressed.
.sp
.ti -.5i
Address array (long) - array (size of the number of rows + 1)
of addresses pointing to the internal start of each row.  Because each row may
be a different size, this array is necessary to provide a mapping of the
data.
.sp
.ti -.5i
Row by row, beginning at the northern edge of the data,  a series of 
byte groups describes the data.
The number of bytes in each group is the number of bytes per cell plus one.
The first byte of each group gives a count (up to 255)
of the number of cells that contain the category 
.CT number value
given by the remaining bytes of the group.
.RE
.sp
3.0 format:
.sp
.RS
.ti -.5i
The 3 byte code is not used.
Instead, a field in the cell header is used to indicate compressed format.
.sp
.ti -.5i
The address array is the same.
.sp
.ti -.5i
The RLE format is the same as the pre-3.0 RLE, except that
each row of
data is preceded by a single byte containing the number of bytes per cell for
the row, and if run-length-encoding the row would not require less space than
non-run-length-encoding, then the row is not encoded.
.sp
.RE
These improvements
give better compression than the pre-3.0 format in 99% of the 
.CT "maps." "cell maps."
The
kinds of 
.CT maps "cell maps"
which get bigger are those in which each row would be
larger if compressed (e.g., imagery band 
.CT "files)." "cell maps)."
But even in this case
the cell 
.CT file map
would only be larger by the size of the address array and
the single byte preceding each row.
