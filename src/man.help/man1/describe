.SH SYNOPSIS
.B describe
.SH DESCRIPTION
The GRASS tool
.I describe 
examines a user-specified 
.CT "grid cell database map layer." "cell map."
\fIdescribe\fR
prompts the user for a 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
name.  The user can select one of the
following two output reports:

(1) RANGE.
A range of 
.CT values "category values"
found in the 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
will be printed.
The range is divided into three groups: negative, positive, and zero.
If negative values occur, the minimum and maximum negative values
will be printed.
If positive values occur, the minimum and maximum positive values
will be printed.
If zero occurs, this will be indicated.

(2) FULL LIST.
A list of all 
.CT values "category values"
that were found in the 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
will be printed.

The following sample output from \fIdescribe\fR:

.ti +.5i
0 2-4 10-13

means that category 
.XT data 
values 0, 2 through 4, and 10 through 13 occurred
in the named 
.CT "map layer." "cell map."

The user must choose to read the 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
in one of two ways:

(1) DIRECTLY.
The current 
.CT window "geographic window"
and mask are ignored and the full 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
is read.
This method is useful if 
.XT the 
the user intends to \fIreclassify\fR or
\fIrescale\fR the data, since these functions (\fIreclass[1]\fR and
\fIrescale[1]\fR) also ignore the current \fI 
.CT window "geographic window"
\fR and \fImask\fR.

(2) WINDOWED and MASKED.
The 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
is read in the
current 
.CT window "geographic window"
masked by the current mask.
.SH NOTES
The range report will generally run faster than the full list.
