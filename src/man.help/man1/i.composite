.IP i.composite\ \- 15
An imagery function that creates a color composite image 
.CT "" "cell map"
from three band 
.CT files "cell maps"
specified by the user
.br
.I (GRASS Imagery Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B i.composite
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I i.composite
creates a color composite image 
.CT "" "cell map" 
from three band 
.CT files "cell maps"
specified by the user.  The user specifies the bands to 
be used by assigning a red, blue, or green color to each band.
The resulting image is a cell 
.CT file map
of raw spectral data
composed of the three bands chosen by the user. The
color composite can then be displayed, painted, or manipulated
as would any cell 
.CT file map
in GRASS.

The first prompt asks the user for the imagery group.

The following menu is then displayed:

.ne 14
.if t \fB
Please indicate which files to use for red, green, and blue colors.
You may leave any color out. You may specify more than one color
per file.  However, each color may only be specified once.  For
example, to get a full color image, specify r,g,b for 3 different
files.  To get a grey scale image, specify rgb for a single file.

The user is then allowed to check the choice of bands:

.ne 7

Colors assigned as follows:

GREEN:|spot.2 in mapsetname
BLUE:|spot.1 in mapsetname
.TE

.ce 1

\fR

The color table that is created has 1000 colors (10 saturation
levels (or shades) per primary color (blue, green, red)).  The
number of colors that can be displayed at one time on a color
.CT "" graphics
monitor will depend on the graphics monitor being used.  For example,
if the graphics monitor can only display 512 colors at
one time, then the user must run the GRASS command \fIDcolormode
fixed\fR before displaying the 
.CT "file." "cell map."
The colors that cannot
be displayed will be assigned to the nearest displayable color, and
the 
.CT file "cell map"
will retain its relative color accuracy.  If the user is in
\fIfloat\fR colormode, however, the 
.CT file "cell map"
displayed on the 
.CT "" graphics
monitor will
not have accurate colors.

The user is then asked to name the composite image 
.CT "." "cell map."
The percentage completed is echoed to the screen and \fIsupport\fR files
are created automatically.
.SH NOTES
The user should always check the 
.CT "" geographic
window before running most imagery
commands. It is very easy for the 
.CT "" geographic
window to be completely off the
image.
Before running \fIi.composite\fR, or other imagery commands,
the user should probably set the 
.CT "" geographic
window to match the 
.CT "data layers" "cell maps"
to be read.
This can be accomplished using option 4 of the
.I window
command.
