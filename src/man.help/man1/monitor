.TH monitor 1
.SH NAME
monitor \- To establish and control use of a graphics monitor through menus
.br
.I (Available through 
.B grass3
.I menu)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B monitor
.SH DESCRIPTION
The GRASS tool \fImonitor\fR
allows the user to start, select, list, query the status of, relinquish
control of, and stop, available graphics monitors.  Through a series
of menus, \fImonitor\fR can perform all of the functions performed
individually by the GRASS \fID\fR monitor commands (see the
\fBSEE ALSO\fR section below for a list of these commands).

When the user enters the command \fImonitor\fR, the below menu appears on
the screen:
.sp
.RS
.TS
ls
cl.
Making sure that the graphics monitor is running:

1	start a graphics monitor
2	stop a graphics monitor
3	list the current status for graphics monitors

.T&
ls
cl.
Choosing a graphics monitor for your graphics:

4	select a graphics device for output
5	relinquish control of the graphics device
	(let someone else use it)
	\fI(option 5 appears only after selection of a monitor)\fR

.T&
ll.
help	print a help message
RETURN	quit

.LP
These options perform the following functions:
.IP 1 4
Start a user-specified monitor program running in the background (unseen
by the user).
The desired monitor should be started once and need not be restarted unless
it is terminated (option \fI2\fR) for some reason.  A monitor may
continue to run for any length of time, even when no GRASS session
is being run.
.IP 2
Stop (terminate) a monitor program.  Sometimes the monitor
program needs to be terminated.  Choosing this option will terminate a
specified monitor.
.IP 3
A monitor has three different types of status: \fImonitor program not
loaded\fR, \fImonitor idle\fR, and \fImonitor assigned to someone\fR.
The status option will list the status of each monitor connected to
the system.

.IP 4
Once a monitor program has been started, it sits \fIidle\fR until the
monitor is \fIselected\fR by someone.  In order to use (direct graphics
output to) an idle monitor, the user must \fIselect\fR that monitor for
use with this option.
.IP 5
After a user \fIselects\fR the monitor, only that user may relinquish it
for use by someone else from within the \fImonitor\fR program.
The person who selected the monitor may deselect (relinquish) it through
use of this option.
This menu option only appears to the person who has selected the monitor.
.LP
You may choose multiple options within the \fImonitor\fR program.
If you need help,
.I help
will print out a help message.
To leave the \fImonitor\fR menu, enter <RETURN>.  
.SH NOTES
The user that selected the monitor is the only one capable of
releasing control of the monitor for use by another \fIthrough the
monitor program\fR.  However, the command-line driven GRASS tool
\fIDrelease.mon[2D]\fR allows \fIanyone\fR to release the monitor, whether
or not they have control of that monitor.
.br
The \fImonitor\fR program can regulate control of graphics 
.CT devices monitors
both in systems
using multiple monitors and in systems using a single graphics monitor.
