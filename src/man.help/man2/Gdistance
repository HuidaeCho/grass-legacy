.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBGdistance\fR \fIoldcell newcell\fR [\fImethod\fR] < \fIrulesfile\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIGdistance\fR creates a new grid cell data layer showing distance (or
proximity) zones around selected map categories. Both the categories 
and the zones are user-chosen. \fIGdistance\fR performs the same function as
does \fIdistance\fR, but with less user interface. See the GRASS manual
entry for \fIdistance[1]\fR for more detailed information.

\fBoldcell\fR identifies the name of the existing data layer from which
distance-from calculations shall be based.
             
\fBnewcell\fR assigns the name (user's choice) for the new data layer which will
contain the results.
            
\fBmethod\fR specifies the name of the method the \fIGdistance\fR program
should use for calculating distance. Method options are \fBto\fR and
\fBfrom\fR.  If unspecified by the user the default is
\fBto\fR. These methods are very different in their execution, but yield the 
same results. The decision to use one, rather than the other, is based partly on
an evaluation of the patterns in which categories of interest appear in
the specified map layer.

.RS
\fBto\fR:  The "tocell" method \fIsearches\fR around each cell in the database 
looking for cells from which distances are to be calculated. This technique is
very fast when there are many cells containing the categories of interest 
scattered throughout the area. It works very slowly when there are few
cells from which to calculate distances, because it takes so long to find them.

\fBfrom\fR: The "fromcell" method goes to each cell that contains a
category from which distances are to be calculated, drawing the
requested distance rings around them.  This method works very quickly
when there are only a few cells containing the categories of interest,
but works slowly when many cells of this category are present.
.RE

\fBrulesfile\fR is the name of a previously prepared \fIGdistance\fR UNIX file.
The user has the option of directing a file with the correct \fIGdistance\fR
rules into \fIGdistance\fR, or entering the rules directly on the command
line. 

.SH RULES
After entering the \fIGdistance\fR command line (if the user is not directing a
UNIX rules file into \fIGdistance\fR), a (\>) prompt will appear. At
the prompt, the user enters:

(1) the selected categories in the existing data layer \fBfrom\fR which 
distances shall be calculated. In the example below, distances are calculated
for categories 2, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 14.

(2) the \fBdist\fRance zones desired. The user has the option of identifying up
to 60 continuous zones. The zones are identified by specifying the upper 
limit of each desired zone (\fIGdistance\fR assumes that 0 is the starting
point). In the 
example below, the distance zones would be (in cells): 0\*-10, 11\*-20,
21\*-30, 31\*-40 and 41\*-50.

(3) \fBend\fR   (This tells \fIGdistance\fR to terminate input and start
creating the new cell file.)

.SH NOTES
\fIGdistance\fR only works on square cells in the current window.
\fIGdistance\fR will complain if cells are not square.
