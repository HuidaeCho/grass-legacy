.SH NAME
Dcell
\- Tool for viewing maps
.br
.I (D Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Dcell
.I "mapname" [overlay=\fI1/0\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dcell 
displays the grid cell map
.I mapname
in the current graphics window, where
.I mapname
is the name of an available cell file in the user's mapset search path.
If the currently chosen window already contains text or graphics, it is
wise to first invoke
.I Derase
to clear the current window before running
.I Dcell.
After running \fIDcell\fR, other \fID\fR programs such as
.I Dvect
and
.I Dgrid
can be used to enhance the plot.
.PP
If run without the overlay=1 option,
.I Dcell
overwrites any image already in the current window (also obscuring
those portions of any windows which overlap the current window).
.PP
If the option overlay=1 is used, those portions of the image
already in the current window which contain category 0
are left untouched.  The \fIDoverlay\fR command is simply the
running of \fIDcell\fR with this option set.
.sp
The default is to set overlay=0, which will cause \fIDcell\fR to
completely overwrite whatever is in the current window.
