.SH NAME
Dcolortable \- To display the color table associated with a cell file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ns
\fBDcolortable\fR\ name\*=\fIcell_file\fR\ [color\*=\fIcolor\fR]\ [lines\*=\fInum_lines\fR]\ [cols\*=\fInum_cols\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The GRASS tool \fIDcolortable\fR
is used to display the color table associated with a cell file in the
current window.  The \fIcell_file\fR named should be an available cell file
in the user's mapset and location.  Options can be stated either positionally
or explicitly on the command line (see \fIDINTRO[2D]\fR).  If options are
not entered on the command line, defaults are used.  If options are entered
positionally on the command line, a dash \fB-\fR can be used to indicate
that the default should be used for the option at that position.  Options
are:
.br
.ns
.TP
.RI color\*= \fIcolor\fR
Color of the lines separating the colors of the color table.  If no color is
stated on the command line, \fIDcolortable\fR defaults to the use
of black lines.
.br
.ns
.TP
.RI lines\*= \fInum_lines\fR
.br
.ns
.TP
.RI cols\*= \fInum_cols\fR
.br
If num_lines and num_cols are not specified, \fIDcolortable\fR
divides the current window equally among the number of categories
present in the named cell file.  If one option is specified,
the other is automatically set  to accommodate all categories.
If both are specified, as many categories as possible are displayed.
.SH EXAMPLE
The user running the command:

\fBDcolortable name\*=soils color\*=red lines\*=1 cols\*=3\fR

would see the current window divided into three columns extending the full
window height.  The lines dividing the color table associated with the
soils map would be displayed in red.
The user would see, at most, only three of the colors from the soils
color table displayed in the current window (because the user requested
that this window be divided into three sections).
.SH NOTES
If the user wishes to display the entire color table associated with
a map, the user should stipulate a number of lines (rows) and columns
sufficient to accommodate the number of categories in the map's color
table.  If the user runs \fIDcolortable\fR using the default number of
lines and columns (the full window), all categories from the map's color
table will be displayed.  However, if the user requests that the color
table associated with a map which has 10 data categories be displayed
in a window with only 3 lines (rows) and 2 columns (a total of six cells),
only six of the ten categories will be displayed.

The user should run the GRASS tool \fIDerase\fR between
runs of \fIDcolortable\fR to avoid confusion.
