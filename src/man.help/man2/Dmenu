.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dmenu
allows the user to create a menu containing a title and numbered options,
and to display it within the current window.  After the menu is displayed,
the pointing device (mouse) is used to select one of the menu options.
The number of the selected menu option is then printed to standard output.
This provides GRASS macro writers with a mouse interface for users.

Options can be stated on the command line, or from within standard input.
If \fIDmenu\fR is run without specified options, default values are used.
However, the user must at least state a menu title, and one menu option.
Options
are:
.ns
.TP 
.RI backcolor\*= color
Sets the color of the menu background (a rectangle on which the text sits)
to that stated.  Color options are red, orange, green, blue, indigo, violet,
black, white, gray, brown, indigo, magenta, and yellow.
If the user states no color, \fIDmenu\fR will default to the use of a gray
background.
.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI textcolor\*= color
Sets the color of the menu text to that stated.  Color options are the same
as those for the \fIbackcolor\fR.  If the user states no color,
.I Dmenu
will default to the use of white lettering.
.br
.ns
.TP
.RI dividercolor\*= color
Sets the color dividing lines of text to that stated.  Color options are
the same as those for backcolor.  This defaults to black, if unstated
by the user.
.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI size\*= number
Sets the menu text size to the specified number.  Sizes are stated as
percentages of the height of the current graphics window.
Text size defaults to 3% of the window height if unstated by the user.
.PP
Options may be stated on the command line either positionally or
explicitly (see \fIDINTRO\fR).  If stated explicitly, they must
be stated in the order specified above.
.PP
The menu text can also be positioned at a specific screen location, by
specifying its distance from the top and left edges of the screen.
This is done from within standard input, by inserting the commands
.B ".T"
(to specify the distance from the top) and/or
.B ".L"
(to specify the distance from the left).  For example,
.br
 .L 10
.br
 .T 10
.br
will place the menu 10% from the screen's top and 10% away from the
screen's left edge.
.SH EXAMPLE
For example, a user wishing to create a menu containing options to be
displayed on the monitor screen might invoke the following command from
a Bourne shell script.
.PP
\fBDmenu red green yellow 5 << EOF
 .T 25
 .L 25
 MENU TITLE
 Option 1
 Option 2
 Option 3
 EOF\fR
.LP
A menu having red background, green text, with menu options divided by
yellow lines, and a text size of 5% of the window height, will then be
displayed on the graphics monitor.  The mouse cursor will also become active,
allowing the user to select (by pointing with the mouse) one of the
displayed menu options (here, these options are called \fIOption 1\fR,
\fIOption 2\fR, and \fIOption 3\fR).  The first line of text input by
the user (here, the words \fIMENU TITLE\fR) indicate the title of the
menu;  this line is not a menu option that can be chosen by the user
with the mouse.  When the user presses one of the mouse buttons while
pointing to the desired menu choice, the number of the option chosen will
be available for capture by the shell script.
.SH NOTES
Although the user can vary text size, all text within the same menu is
displayed in a single text size (and font).  If the user specifies that items
included in the menu's text be displayed in different sizes, all text will
be displayed in the size stated last.
