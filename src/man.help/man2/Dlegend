[option\*=\fIvalue\fR] [option\*=\fIvalue\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dlegend 
displays a legend for the grid cell map
.I mapname
in the current graphics window.  The legend is displayed along the left
edge of the current window, at a scale based on the vertical height
of this window.  All categories in the map are squeezed into the
current window.  The user should therefore take care to create a window
of suitable dimensions.  Portions of the map underlying the legend will
be overwritten.  Options are name and color:
.ns
.TP 
.RI name\*= mapname
Name of the grid cell map to be displayed by \fIDlegend\fR.
.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI color\*= color
Sets the legend color to that stated.  Options are red, orange, green,
blue, indigo, violet, black, white, gray, yellow, brown, and magenta.  The
legend is drawn in white by default if the user does not specify a color.
.LP
If options are stated explicitly, the order in which they are stated is
immaterial.  However, if options are stated positionally, map name must
be stated before color on the command line (see \fIDINTRO\fR).
