.SH NAME
Grescale \- Rescales the 
.CT values "category values"
in a 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
.br
.I (G Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP \fBGrescale\fR 10
\fIold_layer new_layer old_min old_max new_min new_max [title]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Grescale
creates a new 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
that is a rescaling of an
existing 
.CT "data layer." "cell map."
This command is useful for producing representations with
a reduced number of categories from a 
.CT layer "cell map"
with a large range of category
values (e.g., an elevation 
.CT "file)." "cell map)."
Rescaled
.CT "map layers" "cell maps" 
are appropriate for use in such programs as \fIcell.stats(1),
report(1)\fR, and \fIcoin(1)\fR.

The user specifies the name of the 
.CT layer "cell map"
to be rescaled 
.I (old_layer)
and the resulting 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
name
.I (new_layer).
The user also specifes the minimum
.I  (old_min)
and maximum
.I (old_max)
.CT data "category value"
range of the 
.CT map "cell map"
to be rescaled, as well as the desired minimum
.I (new_min)
and maximum
.I (new_max)
output 
.CT data "category value"
range of the resultant rescaled 
.CT "map layer." "cell map."
These 
.CT data "category value"
ranges determine 
the scaling to be performed.  An optional
.I title
may also be specified for the new 
.CT "map layer." "cell map."

.CT Data "Categroy values"
which falls outside of the specified input 
.CT data "category value"
range of the 
.CT map "cell map"
to be
rescaled will become zero.  This allows the user to select a subset of the 
full 
.CT data "category value"
range for rescaling.  The user should know the 
.CT data "category value"
range of the input 
.CT layer "cell map"
before invoking
.I Grescale.
This can be determined by using either the GRASS
.I describe
or
.I Gdescribe
commands.

An appropriate category file and color table, based upon the original 
.CT "map," "cell map,"
are generated with category labels that reflect the original 
.CT values "category values"
used to produce each category.

.SH EXAMPLE
If you want to rescale an elevation 
.CT "data layer" "cell map" 
with 
.CT values "category values"
ranging from
1090 meters to 1800 meters into the range 1\-255,
the following command line could be used:

.IP
\fBGrescale elevation elevation.255 1090 1800 1 255\fR
.SH NOTES
The rescaled 
.CT data "category value"
range is actually unlimited, but the 
.CT data "category value"
range 1 to 255
is used frequently due to limitations of 
.CT "color display devices." "graphics monitors"

\fIGrescale\fR actually runs 
.I Greclass
to represent the rescaled categories.
