.SH NAME 
Mu2ll \- Conversion of UTM to geographic coordinates
.br
.I (Map Development Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Mu2ll 
e\*=\fIeasting\fR n\*=\fInorthing\fR z\*=\fIzone\fR s\*=\fIspheroid\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mu2ll
converts UTM northings and eastings to geographic coordinates
(i.e., latitudes and longitudes). The user must specify the
UTM zone and spheroid on which the geographic coordinates
will be based. 

The list of spheroids available is somewhat dynamic. It may not
contain exactly the ones listed below. To determine the current
list of possible spheroids, type in the command:

.ti +.5i
\fBMu2ll e\*=0 n\*=0 z\*=0 s\*=help\fR

A list of available spheroids will be
printed on the screen. If the spheroid desired is not on the 
list, the values for the semi-major axis and the eccentricity
squared for the spheroid may be entered in place of a spheroid name in the
following format:

.ti +.5i
s\*=a\*=\fIsemi-major_axis\fR,e\*=\fIeccentricity_squared\fR

The point entered is in California and falls in UTM
zone 10. The spheroid used is the Clark 1866.
.SH NOTES
See
.I Mll2u 
for a brief discussion of spheroids.

The UTM zone must be included with the easting
and northing input, because it is the zone that determines
the area of the earth where the point is found. The same UTM
coordinates will be found in different zones. Look at the 
marginalia of the source map to find the proper UTM zone.

This program has received only cursory testing. 
It should be used with some caution.
