.TH Gfilename 2G G-Language
.SH NAME
Gfilename  \- Print database file names
.br
.I (G Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Gfilename
.I element
.I mapset
.I name
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gfilename
is designed for Bourne shell scripts that need to know the full unix file name
for cell files,
vector files, site list files, window files, imagery group files, etc., in
the database.

.IP \fIelement\fR
The database element (i.e., directory within the GRASS mapset location).
.IP \fImapset\fR
The database mapset of the file.
As a convenience, a single dot (.) can be used for the current mapset.
.IP \fIname\fR
The name of the data file.
.SH OUTPUT
.I Gfilename
writes one line to standard output:

.RS
\fIfile\fR=[filename]
.RE

The output is a /bin/sh command to set the variable
.I file
to the full UNIX name
for the database file.
This variable may be set in the /bin/sh as follows:

.RS
eval \(gaGfilename \fIelement mapset name\fR\(ga
.RE
.SH NOTES
This routine generates the filename, but does not care if the
file exists or not. This feature allows shell scripts to create new database
files as well as use existing ones.

If the mapset is the current mapset,
.I Gfindfile
automatically creates the
.I element
if it doesn't already exist.
This makes it easy to add new files to the database without
having to worry about the existence of the required database directories.

The program exits with 0 if everything is ok; non-zero if there is an error,
in which case \fIfile=[filename]\fP is not output.
