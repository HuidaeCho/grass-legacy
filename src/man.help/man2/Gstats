.SH NAME
Gstats \- Prints area statistics for cell 
.CT files maps
.br	
.I (G Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBGstats\fR [-crvz] \fIlayer1\fR [\fIlayer2\fR] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gstats 
prints area statistics for user-specified
.CT "grid cell data layers." "cell maps."
The 
.CT layer "cell map"
name(s) MUST be supplied on the command line. The output can be saved
by redirecting it into a file.

If a single 
.CT layer "cell map"
is specified, a list of areas in square meters (assuming the
.CT "coordinate system" "map coordinate system"
is in meters) for each category in the 
.CT layer "cell map"
will be printed.
(If the -c option is choosen, areas will be stated in number of cells.)
If multiple 
.CT layers "cell maps"
are specified, a cross tabulation table of areas
for each combination of categories in the 
.CT "data layers" "cell maps"
will be printed.

For example, if one 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
is specified, the output would look like:

.nf
.in +.5i
1:1350000.00
2:4940000.00
3:8870000.00
.fi
.in

If 3 
.CT "data layers," "cell map,"
a, b, and c, are specified, the output would look like:

.nf
.in +.5i
0:0:0:8027500.00
1:0:0:164227500.00
2:0:0:31277500.00
3:0:0:17140000.00
1:0:1:2177500.00
2:0:1:2490000.00
0:1:0:1152500.00
1:1:0:140092500.00
2:1:0:24207500.00
3:1:0:11270000.00
1:1:1:3355000.00
2:1:1:1752500.00
3:1:1:2500.00
.fi
.in

Within each grouping, the first field is the category 
.CT number value
of
.CT layer "cell map"
a, the second is for 
.CT layer "cell map"
b, the third is for 
.CT layer "cell map"
c,
and the last is the area in square meters for the particular combination.
For example, the combination 3,1,1 covered 2500 square meters.
Fields are separated by colons.
.SH NOTES
.I Gstats
works in the current 
.CT window "geographic window"
with the current mask.

If a nicely formatted output is desired, pipe the output into
a command which can create columnar output. For example, the command:

    \fBGstats a b c | pr -3 | cat -s\fR

will create a 3-column output

.ne 5
.NF
1:4:4:10000.00          2:1:5:290000.00         2:4:5:2090000.00
1:4:5:1340000.00        2:2:5:350000.00         3:1:2:450000.00
2:1:1:1090000.00        2:4:1:700000.00         3:1:3:5280000.00
2:1:3:410000.00         2:4:3:10000.00          3:1:5:3140000.00
.FI

Also,
the output in the examples given happens to be in sorted order,
but the output from
.I Gstats
on more than one 
.CT layer "cell map"
is not guaranteed to be in any particular order.
If the user desires sorted output, use the unix sort(1) command.
For example:

    \fBGstats a b c | sort -t: -0n\fR

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -c
Prints total cell counts instead of area measurements.
.IP -r
Raw data. The data for each cell in the current 
.CT window "geographic window"
will be output,
one cell per line, rather than totals for each distinct combination. If -R is 
specified, the row:col will be prepended to each output line.
.IP -v
Non-verbose. Supresses percent complete messages.
.IP -z
Non-zero only.
Zero data will not be output. For multiple 
.CT layers "cell maps"
this means zero in every
.CT layer "cell map"
will not be outpout. Non-zero in any 
.CT layer "cell map"
will be output.
