.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Dcolormode
fixed
.br
or
.br
.B Dcolormode
float
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dcolormode 
sets the type of color look-up table used on the graphics monitor.
The command \fBDcolormode fixed\fR
requests that the monitor's color look-up table be \fIfixed\fR (i.e., static).
The effect is that colors drawn on the screen by graphics calls will not
change when subsequent maps are drawn to the screen.  Each time a new map
is drawn on the screen, a color table associated with that map is loaded.
When the
.I fixed
option is used, the colors in the map's color table are mapped to the
nearest colors available in the monitor's fixed color table.  With the
.I float
option, the color table associated with the map is loaded directly into
the monitor's color look-up table.
.PP
There are advantages to using each option.  The 
.I display
program allows the user to interactively modify the colors on the screen.
This can only be done by directly modifying the monitor's color look-up table.
Hence, to accommodate this option in 
.I display,
the 
.I float
option is chosen.  However, this option has the sometimes undesirable effect
of changing the colors used in another map on the screen.  It is best used
with one or more maps having the same color table.  The
.I fixed
option allows any number of maps to be displayed on the screen, where each
uses different colors, but all use the same fixed color look-up table.
You cannot toggle the color table in fixed mode.
.PP
Some devices support only a fixed color look-up; e.g., ink-jet printers,
plotters, and the AT&T 6300 (running a DEB board).  The number of
color categories capable of being displayed is also device-dependent.  If
your colors fall outside this range when in \fIfloat\fR mode, they may not be
represented (this is device-dependent).
.SH BUGS
It is strongly recommended that the user run
.I Dscreen
immediately after changing the mode between
.I fixed
and
.I float.
