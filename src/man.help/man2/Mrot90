.SH NAME
Mrot90 \- Rotates elevation data extracted by either \fIMdted.extract\fR or \fIMdmaUSGSread\fR 
.br
.I (Map Development Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Mrot90
if\*=\fIinputfile\fR of\*=\fIoutputfile\fR rows\*=\fI#\fR cols\*=\fI#\fR bpc\*=\fI#\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mrot90 
is used as a companion program to the DTED and DEM tape extraction
programs
.I Mdted.extract
and
.I MdmaUSGSread.
.I  Mrot90
rotates the contents of the output files generated by these tape
extraction programs 90 degrees.  Rotation is necessary to
compensate for the orientation of the data read from tape.
This program can be used in conjunction with the program
.I "Mimport.ll"
to convert this rotated data into GRASS 
.CT raster "cell map"
form.
.sp
.I Mrot90
requires five inputs to be entered by the user:
.IP \fIif\fR 8
the full pathname of an already-existing file
containing the data to be rotated.
This input file is usually the output file created by
.I Mdted.extract
or
.I MdmaUSGSread.
.IP \fIof\fR
The full pathname of the output file in which the rotated
data is to be stored.
.IP \fIrows\fR
The number of rows of data in the input file.
.IP \fIcols\fR
The number of columns of data in the input file.
.IP \fIbpc\fR
The number of bytes per column in the input file.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following command:
.IP Mrot90 10
\fBif\*=/tmp/dma.out  of\*=/tmp/rot.out  rows\*=301  cols\*=358  bpc\*=2\fR
.LP

will rotate the file /tmp/dma.out, and place the rotated file in
/tmp/rot.out. Here, the input file is 301 rows by 358 columns, at
2 bytes per data value.
.SH NOTE
The user should note that since the output file is rotated 90 degrees
from the original input file, the rows and columns have been interchanged.
Hence in the above example, the number of rows (301) and columns (358) stated
by the user on the command line were those present in the \fIinput\fR file.
The output file, however, will have 358 rows and 301 columns.
