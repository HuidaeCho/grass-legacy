.I (D Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Derase
[\fIcolor\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Derase
erases the contents of the current graphics window, and replaces it with
the color black (by default) or by the stated color.  Color options are red,
orange, yellow, green, blue, yellow, indigo, violet, black, white, gray, brown,
and magenta.  \fIDerase\fR does not remove the current window.  It only
erases the contents of the current window.  Because \fIDerase\fR replaces
the contents of the current window with a color, it will obscure those
portions of any windows which overlap the current window with that color.
\fIDerase\fR will not alter the assignment of the current window.
.SH "NOTES"
.I Derase
will complain if no window has been chosen to be the current window with
.I Dchoose.
