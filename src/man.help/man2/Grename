.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBGrename\fR \fIelement old_name new_name\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Grename
allows the user to rename data 
.CT files "base elements"
in the current mapset.
The user first specifies the type of data 
.CT file "base element"
.XT "(i.e., the data element)"
to be renamed from among those in the below list:

.RS
.TP 14
cell
(cell maps)
.TP 14
vect
(vector maps)
.TP 14
icon
(paint icon files)
.TP 14

(paint labels)
.TP 14
sites
(site maps)
.TP 14
window
(window files)
.TP 14
group

.RE

.PP
In addition to choosing the 
.CT data "data base"
element, the user specifies both
\fIold_name\fR (i.e., the 
.CT file element
to be renamed) and \fInew_name\fR (the
name of a new 
.CT file element
in the current mapset which will hold the renamed 
.CT "file)." "data base element)."

The old 
.CT file "data base element"
\fIold_name\fR is then renamed to \fInew_name\fR.
.SH NOTE
If a data 
.CT "element file" "base element"
has support files (e.g., cell 
.CT "files)," "maps),"
these support files also are renamed.
