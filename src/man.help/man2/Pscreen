.SH NAME
Pscreen \- Paint screen image file saved by \fIDsavescreen\fR
.SH SYNPOSIS
\fBPscreen\fR \fIsavedfile\fR [-bw] [-w#] [-#[p/i]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pscreen
paints the screen image file created by \fIDsavescreen\fR on the
the color printer. The options which may be specified are:
.IP -bw
Select black and white reversal. Whatever is specified as black in the original
.CT image "screen image"
is painted as white, and whatever was white is painted as black.
.IP -w#
Force 
.CT image "screen image"
color # to white. Enables user to set the 
background color to white without having to reverse all black and white.
For example -w0 will set color 0 to white.
.IP -#[p/i]
This option selects the output scaling. If not specified, the 
.CT image "screen image"
is scaled
to fill the width of the printer (i.e., \fB\-1p\fR, 1 panel wide). Otherwise,
it has three formats:

.RS
.IP -#
outputs the 
.CT image "screen image"
at the ratio 1 image pixel to # printer pixels.
(i.e., -4 will print the 
.CT image "screen image"
at 1 image pixel = 4 printer pixels).
This option is useful if the resampling of the 
.CT image "screen image"
must be controlled.

Since rescaling often entails dropping some input pixels or repeating some
input pixels more often than others, linear elements in the 
.CT image "screen image"
may be
distorted. This effect can be eliminated by specifying -1 as the scaling 
factor.
.IP -#p
outputs the 
.CT image "screen image"
# panels wide (i.e., \-3p will print the 
.CT image "screen image"
3 panels wide). 
.IP -#i
outputs the 
.CT image "screen image"
# inches wide (i.e., -8.5i will print the
.CT image "screen image"
8.5 inches wide).

.SH NOTES
The input file to \fIPscreen\fR is generated by the program
\fIDsavescreen\fR. At present, 
\fIDsavescreen\fR only exists for MASSCOMP systems. If you do not have a 
MASSCOMP, you probably will not be able to save screens to be painted by 
\fIPscreen\fR.
