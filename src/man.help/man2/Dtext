.TH Dtext 2D D-language
.SH NAME
Dtext \- Draws text in the current graphics window
.br
.I (D Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Dtext
[\fIcolor\fR [\fIsize\fR [\fIline\fR]]]
.br
.B Dtext
[color\*=\fIvalue\fR] [size\*=\fIvalue\fR] [line\*=\fIvalue\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIDtext\fR draws text in the current graphics window. Text is provided
through standard input.  Options are text color, size, and line number.  These
options can be stated either positionally or explicitly on the command line
(see \fIDINTRO[2D]\fR), and are entered on the command line as:
.ns
.TP 
.RI color\*= color
Color desired for drawing text.
Sets the current color to that stated.  Options are red, orange, green, blue,
indigo, violet, black, white, gray, yellow, brown, and magenta.  The default,
if unspecified, is \fIwhite\fR text.
.br
.ns
.TP
.RI size\*= number
Height of letters in percent (between 0-100) of available window height.
The default, if unspecified, is \fI10\fR.
.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI line\*= line_number
The screen line number on which text will be begun to be drawn (line 1 is
at the top of the screen).  If unspecified, text will begin by default
on line \fI1\fR.
.br
.sp 1
.PP
In addition to the options provided on the command line, colors, text size,
font type, and boldness can be adjusted with commands in the standard input
(i.e., if the user invokes \fIDtext\fR without options on the command line,
and then assigns values to these options on lines within the standard input).

The command:
.br
 .C \fIcolor\fR
.br
(where \fIcolor\fR is one of the available colors) causes text appearing on
subsequent lines to be drawn in that color.

Text size can be adjusted with
the command:
.br
 .S
.I size
.br
(where \fIsize\fR is a percentage within the range 0 to 100).  Note that
a size of 10 would allow 10 lines to be drawn in the window, 5 would
allow the drawing of 20 lines, and 50 would allow the drawing of 2 lines.

Font type can be manipulated using the command:
.br
 .F
.I font
.br
(where \fIfont\fR is one of the fonts known by the GRASS tool
\fIDfont\fR).  Available fonts are listed in the GRASS manual entry for
\fIDfont\fR[2D].  The default font used (if unspecified by the user)
is romanp.  Run the GRASS macro \fIDshow.fonts\fR to see what these fonts
look like.

The user can also stipulate that text be printed in \fBbold\fR on lines
beneath the command:
.br
 .B 1
.br
This command means
.I "bold on". 
.br
Similarly, the command:
.br
 .B 0
.br
turns \fIbold off\fR of all text appearing on lines beneath it. (\fIBold
off\fR is the default, if unspecified.)
.SH EXAMPLE
The following command will print the short phrase "This is a test of
Dtext" in the current window using the color yellow, in bold, and using
4/100 ths (4%) of the window's vertical space per line:
.nf
	  Dtext
   	  .C yellow
	  .S 4
	  .B 1
	  This is a test of Dtext
.fi
The user presses \fIcontrol-d\fR (the "ctrl" and "d" keys) to halt input.
.SH "NOTES"
Note that the GRASS command \fIDtitle\fR creates map titles in a format
suitable for input to \fIDtext\fR.
.SH NEEDS
.I Dtext
needs escape sequences that can be used within lines to change colors,
boldness, and perhaps size.
