.B Dwhere
[\fIspheroid\fR] [\fImode\fR]

\fBDwhere\fR [option\*=\fIvalue\fR] [option\*=\fIvalue\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dwhere 
is an
.I interactive
tool which allows the user, using the pointing device (mouse), to identify
locations on the map in the current graphics window.

If the user runs
.I Dwhere
without options, each mouse click will output the UTM easting and northing
of the point currently beneath the mouse pointer.  A button menu is
presented so the user knows which mouse buttons to use. The output is
always printed to the screen.  If the output is redirected into a file,
it will be written to the file as well.

If \fIDwhere\fR is run with the
.RI s\*= spheroid
option, latitude and longitude values will also be
printed. The user must specify a valid spheroid.  To find out what spheroids
\fIDwhere\fR knows about, type \fBDwhere help\fR.  Currently, valid
spheroid options include: australian, clark80, wgs72, bessel, everest,
clark66, and international.

If run with the
.RI m\*= quiet
option, only one mouse click is executed.
This option is provided for shell scripts and programs which want to
obtain only
one point from the user. The output is only written to stdout, unless
redirected into a file.  The default, if unspecified, is to run in
a mode with the quiet off.
