.SH DESCRIPTION
.I D3d 
provides device-independent 3-dimensional graphic images based on 
GRASS grid cell maps.  The user identifies the viewing location, the
line of sight, the view angle, a vertical exaggeration factor, and
the map to be used for "elevation" data.  This program is
a non-interactive version of the GRASS tool \fId.3d\fR.
Refer to the \fId.3d\fR manual entry for a detailed examination
of the production of three-dimensional images in GRASS, and
of specific parameters.  Three-dimensional images can also be generated
through the GRASS \fIdisplay\fR program.

.RS
.TP
\fIfile\fR=map_name
.br
Name of the map to be displayed in 3-d.
.TP
\fIfe\fR=from_easting
.TP
\fIfn\fR=from_northing
.TP
\fIfh\fR=from_height
.br
The 3-d location of the viewing location.  Defaults to 30,000 units
high, and just southwest of the current window.
.TP
\fIte\fR=to_elevation
.TP
\fItn\fR=to_northing
.TP
\fIth\fR=to_height
.br
The 3-d location to appear in the center of the graphics window.
Defaults to 0 units high, and the center of the display window.
.TP
\fIew\fR=east-west resolution
.TP
\fIns\fR=north-south resolution
.TP
\fIlf\fR=line_frequency
.br
Black lines are drawn on the 3-d image to improve the image.
This value is the number of rows and columns to skip between lines.
Defaults to 10.  0 means "no lines".
.TP
\fIexag\fR=exaggerating_file
.br
This value is multiplied times the "elevations" in the elevation file.
Defaults to 2.
.TP
\fIef\fR=elevation_file
.br
Name of the file to provide the elevation values.  Generally, this is
something like "elevation", but can be any file.
.TP
\fIva\fR=viewing_angle
.br
The field of view in the image.  Defaults to 40 degrees.
.RE

The image is drawn in the current graphics window.
The \fID\fR language
program \fIDscreen\fR can be run before running \fID3d\fR run to prepare
the a full-screen window for graphics.  Refer to the GRASS tool \fID3d.view\fR
for a demonstration of the \fID3d\fR program.
