.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dscale
displays a scale and North arrow in the current window.  It is
automatically proportioned to fit appropriately in the upper left corner
of the current window.  It is drawn twice in two different colors; the default
(if unspecified on the command line) is the use of a white scale on a
black background.  Options are:
.ns
.TP 
.RI color1\*= color
Color used for the first drawing of the scale (background).  Default is black.
.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI color2\*= color
Color used for second drawing of the scale (offset).  Default is white.
.PP
Available colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet,
gray, brown, magenta, white, and black.  Background and offset colors
can be stated either positionally or explicitly on the command line.
.SH BUGS
The user has no option to choose where the scale is drawn on the screen,
and
.I Dscale
assumes that units are in meters.
.br
The scale that \fIDscale\fR generates is not suitable for very tiny maps.
