.SH NAME
Gweight \- Weighted overlay analysis tool
.br
.I (G Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Gweight
\fI[output] [action] [color]\fR
.br
.B Gweight
[output\*=\fIoption\fR] [action\*=\fIoption\fR] [color\*=\fIoption\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIGweight\fR is the non-interactive version of \fIweight\fR.
Both programs allow the user to assign numeric values (i.e.,
"weights") to individual 
.CT "data categories" "category values"
within 
.CT "map layers." "cell maps."
These weights are then distributed locationally throughout a 
.CT "map layer," "cell map,"
based on the distribution of the categories with which they
are associated.
The user can weight the categories of several 
.CT "map layers" "cell maps"
in a 
.CT "database." "data base."
Such weighted 
.CT "map layers" "cell maps"
can then be overlain.
\fIGweight\fR will combine weights in the overlain 
.CT "map layers," "cell maps,"
by 
.XT grid 
cell 
.CT "location." "position."
A resulting output 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
depicts the combination of 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
weights across a landscape.  These values represent a hierarchy
of suitability for some user-defined purpose.  To obtain a more
detailed description, see the manual entry for \fIweight[1]\fR.

.TS
l l.
\fIOutput\fR cell map must be specified	(no default)
\fIAction\fR must be either (\fIadd\fR or \fImult\fR)	(default: add)
\fIColor\fR table for the new cell map (grey | wave | ramp)	(default: grey)
.TE
.PP
Once the \fIGweight\fR command line is entered, the user will need to
enter a 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
name and assign numeric values to
its categories.  Values can be assigned to the categories of up to six
.CT "map layers" "cell maps"
within \fIGweight\fR in a single analysis.  Help is available
to the user by typing \fBGweight help\fR.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following is the format in which data should be entered to \fIGweight\fR:
.nf
.RS
Cell_layer1
[Reclass rule 1a]
[Reclass rule 1b]
Cell_layer2
[Reclass rule 2a]
etc.
end
.RE
Cell_layer:  \fIcell_map\fR OR "\fIcell_map in mapset\fR"
Reclass rule: (example)  1 = 5 OR 20 thru 50 = 10 (must leave spaces between 
  the category, =, and value entries)
.fi

Example: (the prompts are shown in bold)
.nf
.RS
\fB\>  \fRGweight sites add wave\fB
>  \fRsoils\fB
.in 1.5i

soils\>  \fR1 thru 20 = 5\fB
soils\>  \fR21 thru 30 = 10\fB
soils\>  \fRlandcover\fB

landcover\>  \fR1 = 2\fB
landcover\>  \fR2 = 4\fB
landcover\>  \fR3 thru 8 = 6\fB
landcover\>  \fRend\fB

.SH NOTES
The user must be knowledgeable about \fIweight\fR to run \fIGweight\fR.
\fIGweight\fR does not provide the user with a listing
of 
.CT "map layers" "cell maps"
or 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
categories.  Users unsure about cell map
.XT layer 
names should run the GRASS tool \fIGlist\fR.  To obtain a listing
of the categories for a 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
run \fIGreport\fR.

The user can create an input file containing the data needed to run 
\fIGweight\fR.  This file must list the cell 
.CT files map
and reclass rules in
the format shown in the above example.  The prompts must not be included
in the file.  This file can be directed into \fIGweight\fR at the command
line by typing \fBGweight output action color \<  input_file\fR
.SH BUGS
When entering data for the reclass rules, if the 
user does not include spaces between the category, =, and value, the
program will assume that the entry is a cell 
.CT "file." "map."
