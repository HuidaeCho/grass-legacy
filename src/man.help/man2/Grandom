.SH NAME
Grandom \- Create a 
.CT map "cell map"
and 
.CT "sites list" "site map"
containing randomly located sites
.br
.I "(G Language Tool)"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Grandom
[-vz] \fIinputmap outputmap n[%] [sitefile]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Grandom
provides a means for creating an
.I outputmap
.CT layer "cell map"
and a
.I sitefile
.CT "(sites list file)" "(site map)"
containing sites whose locations are determined randomly.
The general region in which to generate these random locations is determined
by the current 
.CT window "geographic window"
and mask, and within non-zero data areas on the
.I inputmap
on a current 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
specified by the user.  The user may specify
the random locations to be generated either as an \fIabsolute number\fR
(e.g., 10), or as a \fIpercentage of the 
.CT "map's" "cell map's"
total size\fR
(e.g., 1%, or 3.05%).
If specified as a percentage, the number of random locations generated
will be set equal to the number of 
.XT grid 
cells appearing in that percentage
of the 
.CT "map." "cell map." 
(Note that percentages less than 1% may be stated as decimals.)
The 
.I outputmap
.CT layer "cell map"
is created
in the current mapset and contains randomly located 
.CT "pixels." "cells."
The categories on the
.I inputmap
where
random cells hit are copied to the 
.I outputmap.
The category names from the
.I inputmap
are copied for the new 
.CT "map." "cell map."
A  color table for the
.I outputmap
is generated to contrast with the colors in the
.I inputmap.

The
.I sitefile
created will have
coordinates which are the
.I centers
of the randomly selected cells.

The user can elect to supress generation of the \fIoutputmap\fR by specifying
a dash \fB-\fR in place of an output 
.CT file "cell map"
name on the command line.
Since generation of the \fIsitefile\fR is optional, the user can
supress generation of the \fIsitefile\fR simply by failing to include
one on the command line.

The
.I outputmap
may be suppressed by specifying "-".
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Supresses verbose. \fIGrandom\fR will normally output to the error output
messages as it runs. The -v option will suppress the printing of
these messages.
.IP -z
Generate random locations against category zero as well.
If the -z option is specified,
the locations which fall in category zero
will be added as a new category to the output 
.CT "map." "cell map."
.SH NOTES
If it is desired to create random locations within some, but not all,
non-zero categories of the input 
.CT "map," "cell map,"
the user must first create a
reclassified 
.CT map "cell map"
of the original 
.CT map "cell map"
(e.g., using the GRASS
tool \fIreclass\fR) which contains only the desired categories,
and then use the reclassed 
.CT map "cell map"
as input to \fIGrandom\fR.
