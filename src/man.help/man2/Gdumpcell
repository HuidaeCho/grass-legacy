.SH NAME
Gdumpcell \- Converts a cell file into an ascii text file
.br
.I (G Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBGdumpcell\fR [\fI-#\fR]
.I layer
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gdumpcell
allows the user to convert a map \fIlayer\fR into an ascii text file
suitable for export into other computer systems.  The \fB-#\fR option
(where \fB#\fR is a number of the user's choice) can be used to request
that numbers in the ouput be equally-spaced (i.e., columnar output).
Each category number
in the ascii map layer will then take up \fB#\fR number of spaces.
However, to use this, the user should know the maximum number of
digits that will occur in the output file, and add one to this number
(to leave a space between each column).  The user can find the maximum
number of digits occuring in the output file
by running \fIGdumpcell\fR without the \fB-#\fR option.
.SH NOTES
The output from \fIGdumpcell\fR
may be placed into a file by using the UNIX redirection mechanism.
For example:

.ce 1
.B "Gdumpcell layer > file"

The output file can then be printed or copied onto a magnetic tape or
floppy disk for export purposes.
