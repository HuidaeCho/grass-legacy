Gmfilter - Cell

matrix filter

.I (G Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP \fBGmfilter\fR 10
[-v0] if\*=\fIinput\fR of\*=\fIoutput\fR ff\*=\fIfilterfile\fR [repeat\*=\fIn\fR] [\fItitle\*=title\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gmfilter
filters the
.I input
to produce the
.I output
according to the matrix filter designed by the user (see \fIFILTERS\fR
below).
The filter is applied
.I n
times (default 1).
The output cell 
.CT file map
can be given a
.I title
if desired.
(The title should be put in quotes if it contains more than one word.)
.SH FILTERS
The \fIfilterfile\fR is a normal UNIX ascii file designed by the user.
It has the following format:

.TS
tab(:);
ll.
TITLE:title
MATRIX:n
:.
.T&
ls.
n lines of n integers
.T&
ll.
:.
DIVISOR:d
START:UL/LL/UR/LR
TYPE:S/P
.TE

.IP TITLE 10
A one line title for the filter. If a title was not specified on the command
line, it can be specified here. This title would be used to construct a title 
for the resulting cell 
.CT "file." "map."
It should be a one line description of the filter.
.IP MATRIX
The matrix (n x n) follows on the next n lines.  \fIn\fR must be
an odd integer greater than or equal to 3.
The matrix itself is n rows of n integers.
The integers must be separated from each other by at least 1 blank.
.IP DIVISOR
The filter divisor is \fId\fR. If not specified, the default is 1.
If the divisor is zero (0), then the divisor is dependent on the
.CT data "category values"
in the neighborhood (see HOW THE FILTER WORKS below).
.IP START
This specifies the starting corner for the filter.
This also specifies the movement of the filter.
If not specified, the
default is UL.
.RS
.IP UL
Upper left (to lower right)
.IP UR
Upper right (to lower left)
.IP LL
Lower left (to upper right)
.IP LR
Lower right (to upper left)
.RE
.IP TYPE
The filter type.  \fIS\fR means sequential, while \fIP\fR mean parallel.
If not specified, the default is S.

Sequential filtering
happens in place. As the filter is applied to the 
.CT "map," "cell map,"
the 
.Ct values "category values"
that
were changed in neighboring cells affect the resulting 
.CT value "category value"
of the current
cell being filtered.

Parallel filtering happens in such a way that the original
.CT map "cell map"
.CT values "category values"
are used to produce the new 
.CT "value." "category value."

.LP
More than one filter may be specified in the filter file.
The additional filter(s) are described just like the first.
For example, the following describes two filters:
.SH EXAMPLE FILTER FILE

.SH HOW THE FILTER WORKS
The filter process produces a new 
.CT cell category
value for each cell
in the input 
.CT file "cell map"
by multiplying the 
.CT values "category values"
of the
cells in the n x n neighborhood around the center cell
by the corresponding matrix value
and adding them together. If a divisor is specified, the sum is
divided by this divisor, rounding to the nearest integer.
(If a zero divisor was specified, then
the divisor is computed for each cell as the sum of the MATRIX
values where the corresponding input cell is non-zero.)

If more than one filter step is specified, either because the
repeat value was greater than one or because the filter file
contained more than one matrix, these steps are performed
sequentially. This means that first one filter is applied to
the entire input 
.CT map "cell map"
to produce an intermediate result. Then
the next filter is applied to the intermediate result to
produce another intermediate result, and so on until the
final filter is applied. Then the output cell is written.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -0
The filter is
applied only to zero 
.CT data category
values in the input cell 
.CT "file." "map."
The non-zero 
.CT values "category values"
are not changed. Note that if there is more
than one filter step, this rule is applied to the intermediate
.CT map "cell map"
- only zero 
.CT values "category values"
which result from the first filter will
be changed. In most cases this will NOT be the desired result.
Hence -0 should be used only with single step filters.


.IP -v
\fIGmfilter\fR will normally print messages to indicate what is is doing as it
proceeds. Specifying -v will make it run silently.
.SH NOTES
If the
resolution of the 
.CT window "geographic window"
does not agree with the resolution of
the 
.CT "data," "cell map," 
unintended resampling of the original data may occur.
The user should be sure that the 
.CT window "geographic window"
is set properly.
