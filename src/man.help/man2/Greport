.SH NAME
Greport \- Reports statistics for 
.CT "grid cell files" "cell maps"

.I (G Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBGreport\fR [\fIlayer\fR] [\fIunits\fR]
.br
\fBGreport\fR [layer\*=\fIoption\fR] [units\*=\fIoption\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Greport
allows the user to set up a series of report parameters to be applied to
a 
.CT "map layer," "cell map,"
and creates a report.
The report will print out to the screen only.  However, output may be
redirected to a file or another program using the UNIX redirection
mechanism.

The user must specify which 
.XT map
.I layer
and what
.I units
of measurement the
user wants to be reported (multiple units can be reported).  The user
.XT has 
can choose from among seven
.I units:

.RS
.TS
l l.
number	= # cells in area of interest 
percent	= % cover (including no data areas)
percent-0	= % cover (excluding no data areas)
acres	= cover measured in acres
hectares	= cover measured in hectares
kilometers	= cover measured in square kilometers
miles	= cover measured in square miles
.TE      
.RE

These units are based on the number of cells in the user's
\fIarea of interest\fR which is the combination of the current 
.I "geographic window"
and the current
.I mask
(if any).
These are established with the programs
.I window
and
.I mask
respectively.

The report itself consists of two parts, a header section and the main
body of the report.

The header section of the report identifies the 
.CT "map layer" "cell map" 
(by 
.XT layer 
name and
title), location, mapset, report date and the area of interest.  The
area of interest is described in two parts: the user's current 
.CT window "geographic window"
is
presented, and the mask is presented (if any is used).

The main body of the report consists of from one to three tables
which present the statistics for
each category and the totals for each unit column.

Following is the result of a
.I Greport
run on the cell 
.CT file map
"geology" with the units expressed in square miles
and acres, located in the Spearfish sample 
.CT "database." "data base." 
Here, \fIGreport\fR
output is directed into the file "report.file".
