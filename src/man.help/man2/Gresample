.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Gresample
[-v] \fIinput_layer output_layer\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIGresample\fR resamples a 
.CT "data layer." "cell map."
\fIGresample\fR reads the user-specified 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
into the
current 
.CT window "geographic window"
masked by the current mask, and produces a new
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
containing the result of the resampling. The 
.CT data category
values in the new cell 
.CT file map
will be the same as in the original,
except that the resolution and extent of the new 
.CT "data layer" "cell map"
will match those of the current 
.CT "window." "geographic window."
Use of the \fB-v\fR option will reduce
the amount of chatter that \fIGresample\fR will do while running. 
.SH NOTES
The resulting 
.CT layer "cell map"
can be the same as the original 
.CT "layer." "cell map."
The color table, category file, and history file for the
original 
.CT layer "cell map"
are copied to those for the resulting 
.CT "layer." "cell map."
