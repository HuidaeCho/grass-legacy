.SH NAME
Dtitle \- Create a title for a grid cell map
.br
.I (D Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Dtitle
\fIname\fR [\fIcolor\fR [\fIsize\fR [\fIfancy\fR]]]
.br
.B Dtitle
[option\*=\fIvalue\fR] [option\*=\fIvalue\fR] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dtitle 
generates to standard output a string which can be used by \fIDtext\fR
to draw a
title for the cell map \fImapname\fR in the current graphics window.
Output created by \fIDtitle\fR can be redirected into a file, or piped
directly into \fIDtext\fR
to display the map title created by \fIDtitle\fR.  The map title created
will include the map layer's name, MAPSET, LOCATION, window coordinates,
and resolution.  \fIDtitle\fR can be run with options that can be
stated explicitly or positionally on the command line (see \fIDINTRO\fR).
Options are:
.ns
.TP 
.RI name\*= map_name
An available cell file map in the user's mapset search path (no
default file is used if this is unspecified).
.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI color\*= color
Sets the current color to that stated.  Options are red, orange, green, blue,
indigo, violet, black, white, gray, yellow, brown, and magenta.  If
unspecified, the current color defaults to white.
.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI size\*= size
Sets the current text size as a percentage of the window's vertical
height to that stated.  Size can range between 0-100.  If unspecified,
the text size defaults to 10% of the window's height (\fBsize\*=10\fR).
.br
.ns
.TP
.RI type\*= fancy
Puts the cell file LOCATION name (the label's first line) in another color,
one text size larger than the other lines of text in the label.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
For example, a user wishing to create a suitable title for the
Spearfish, SD \fIsoils\fR map layer and display this title in the
current window might do the following:
.PP
.B "Dtitle soils red 5 > title.file"
.LP
.PP
.B "Dtext < title.file"
.LP
Similarly, the user might pipe \fIDtitle\fR output directly into \fIDtext\fR:
.br
.PP
.B "Dtitle soils red 5 | Dtext"
.LP
.SH "NOTES"
The text created with \fIDtext\fR will not necessarily fit within the
current window;  the user should choose a text size appropriate to the
window.
