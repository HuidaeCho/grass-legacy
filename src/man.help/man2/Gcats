.TH Gcats 2G G-language
.SH NAME
Gcats \- print category labels for cell files
.br	
.I (G Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
Gcats [-t'tabchar'] layer [catlist]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The category labels for the cell file
.I layer
are printed to the screen.
If no specific categories are list on the command line
(using the optional
.I catlist
arguments), then all the catgegory labels for the data layer are printed.
(The entire
.I layer
is read, using Gdescribe(2), to determine which
categories occur in the 
.I layer.)
If a list of categories are specified, then the labels for those categories
only are printed. The
.I catlist
may be single catgory numbers, or ranges of numbers.

The output is one label per line, with the category number first, then an ascii
TAB character, then the label for the category.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -t\fIc\fP
Changes the TAB character to
.I c
(see example below).
.SH EXAMPLES
.RS
Gcats soils
.RE

prints the labels for all the categories for the "soils" map;

.RS
Gcats soils 10 12 15-20
.RE

prints only the labels for categories 10, 12, and 15 through 20; and

.RS
Gcats -t: soils 10 20
.RE

prints the labels for categories 10 and 20 of "soils",
but with ":" as the separator character.

Example output:

.RS
10:Dumps, mine, Cc
.br
20:Kyle clay, KaA
.RE
.SH NOTES
Any ascii TAB characters which may be in the label are replaced by spaces.

The output from Gcats can be redirected into a file, or piped into
another program.
