.SH NAME
Mll2u \- Conversion of geographic to UTM coordinates

.I (Map Development Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP \fBMll2u\fR 7

s\*=\fIspheroid\fR [z\*=\fIzone\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mll2u
converts geographic coordinates (i.e., latitude and
longitude) to UTM eastings and northings. The user
must specify the spheroid on which to base the UTM conversion.
The UTM zone may be specified, but is optional because
it can be determined by the geographic coordinates.

The list of spheroids available is somewhat dynamic. It may not
contain exactly the ones listed below. To determine the current
list of possible spheroids, simply type in:

.ti +.5i
Mll2u lat\*=0n lon\*=0w s\*=help

A list of available spheroids will be
printed on the screen. If the spheroid desired is not on the 
list, the values for the semi-major axis and the eccentricity
squared for the spheroid may be entered in place of a spheroid name in the
following format:

.ti +.5i
s\*=a\*=\fIsemi-major_axis\fR,e\*=\fIeccentricity_squared\fR

This lists the easting, the northing, and the UTM zone of the 
sample point.
This point is in Hawaii, and the spheroid used in
the source map is the "international."
.SH NOTES
Spheroids, the solids associated with an ellipse,
are also known as ellipsoids. 
They are used as the best possible model to
simulate the shape of the earth with its flattened
poles and bulging equator. They are the mathematical
means for establishing control points to use as a
reference when determining exact locations on the earth.
A cohesive set of these control points is called a datum.

The spheroids listed above have
been used as the basis for a number of different datums.
The North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27) was based on the
Clark 1866 (clark66) spheroid. This is a current standard datum for North
America. Be aware, however, that a new datum, NAD 83, has been
developed using the Geodetic Reference System 1980 spheroid,
which is not yet available in 
.I Mll2u.
Also, "wgs72" is the only one
of the above listed spheroids which is for worldwide use. It has
been used fairly widely by the Department of Defense (DOD)
and is the basis for the World
Geodetic System 1972 datum. This datum has also been recently
replaced. The new DOD datum is WGS 84. The spheroid for this datum
is not yet available in
.I Mll2u.

Read the marginalia of the source map to determine
which spheroid was used to produce the map.

This program has received only cursory testing. It should
be used with some caution.
