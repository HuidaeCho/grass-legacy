.SH NAME
Dgraph \- Tool for generating simple graphics
.br
.I (D Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Dgraph
[\fIname\fR [\fIcolor\fR]]
.br
.B Dgraph
[option\*=\fIvalue\fR] [option\*=\fIvalue\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dgraph 
draws graphics that are described either in standard input (default), or
within the GRASS file
.I filename
if an input filename is identified on the command line.  If graphics
commands are entered from standard input, a \fIctrl-d\fR
is used to signal the end of input to \fIDgraph\fR.  Options are:
.ns
.TP 
.RI name= file_name
Name of file containing graphics commands.  This is a UNIX file name;
specify the full pathname of the file.  If no filename is specified
on the command line, commands are taken from within standard input.
.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI color= color
Starting color desired for graphics. Default is \fIwhite\fR if unspecified.
.br
.PP
The coordinate system used is 0-100 in x and 0-100 in y,
regardless of window size and aspect.   The 0,0 location is the lower left
corner of the current graphics window.  All values may be floating point.
.PP
The graphics language is simple, using the following commands:
.ns
.TP 
# \fIcomment\fR
A line of comment which is ignored in the processing.
.br
.TP 
move \fIxpos ypos\fR
The current location is updated to \fI(xpos,ypos)\fR.
.br
.TP 
draw \fIxpos ypos\fR
A line is drawn in the current color from the current location to the new
location
.I (xpos,ypos),
which then becomes the current location.
.br
.TP 
color \fIcolor\fR
Sets the current color to that stated;  subsequent graphics will be drawn
in the stated color, until the current color is set to a different color.
Options are red, orange, green, blue, indigo, violet, black, white, gray,
yellow, brown, indigo, and magenta.
.br
.TP 
size \fIxper yper\fR
Subsequent text will be drawn such that the text is
.I xper
percent of the window wide and
.I yper
percent of the window high.
.br
.TP 
text \fIline-of-text\fR
The stated text is drawn at the current location using the current color.
.br
.TP
icon \fItype size x y\fR
Draws an icon of types 0, x, or + with specified size at location x,y.

The coordinates appearing beneath the word 
.I polygon,
one pair per line, circumscribe a polygon
which is to be filled with the current color.

.SH EXAMPLE
For an example, examine the macro command
.I Dgrass.logo
located in the GRASS command bin
(which draws a GRASS logo by inputting \fIDgraph\fR graphics commands
that are stored in a shell file).
Note that the coordinates in the \fIDgrass.logo\fR macro were taken directly
off an image drawn by hand on graph paper.
.SH LIMITATIONS
There are no automated ways of generating graphic images.  It is anticipated
that GRASS user sites will write tools to convert output from a resident
graphics editor into GRASS \fIDgraph\fR format.
