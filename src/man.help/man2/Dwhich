.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dwhich 
determines which available graphics window accomodates the given screen
coordinate.  On exit it prints the graphics window name.
Options are:
.ns
.TP 
.RI horizontal\*= number
Where \fInumber\fR is the X, or horizontal screen coordinate.
.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI vertical\*= number
Where \fInumber\fR is the Y, or vertical screen coordinate.
.br
.PP
The coordinates are percentage values (within the range of 0-99), with
the coordinates 0,0 representing the lower left corner of the screen.
.SH BUGS
A coordinate location falling inside two or more overlapping windows
will arbitrarily select the window whose right side is closest to
that coordinate location.  Care must be taken with overlapping windows,
as the results will be undefined.
