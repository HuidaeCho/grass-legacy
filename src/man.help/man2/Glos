[patt_layer\*=\fIname\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIGlos\fR generates an output map on which the cells that are visible
from a user-specified observer location are marked with integer values
that represent the vertical angle (in degrees) required to see those cells. 
The input to the program is as follows:
.IP \fIelev_layer\fR
File name of a grid cell layer containing elevation data.
.IP \fIpatt_layer\fR
File name of a 1/0 grid cell map layer which has cells within the areas
of interest coded with 1 while the rest are coded with '0'. If omitted,
the analysis will be performed for the whole area within a certain distance
of the viewing point inside the database window.
.IP "\fIeast, north\fR"
Coordinates identifying the desired location of the viewing point.
.IP \fIobs_elev\fR
Height of the observer (in meters) above the viewing point's elevation.
If omitted, a default value of 1.75m is assumed.
.IP \fImax_dist\fR
Maximum distance (in meters) from the viewing point inside of which the
line of sight analysis will be performed. The grid cells outside this
distance range are coded with '0'. If omitted, a default maximum distance
of 100 grid cells is assumed.
.IP \fIout_layer\fR
File name of the data layer in which the results will be stored.
.SH NOTES 
For accurate results, the program must be run with the window resolution
equal to the resolution of the data.
.sp
It is advisable to use a 'pattern layer' which identifies the areas of
interest in which the line of sight analysis is required.
Such a measure will reduce the time taken by the program to run.
