.TH Dchoose 2D D-language
.SH NAME
Dchoose \- Chooses a window in which to display graphics
.br
.I (D Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Dchoose
.I "[window_name]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
A window created with the 
.I Dnew
command is assigned through the use of
.I Dchoose
to become the
.I current
window.  (\fIDnew\fR will create additional windows, but it will not change
the assignment of the current window.)  Although many windows can coexist
on the screen, only one window can be the current window at any given time.
Commands such as \fIDerase[2D]\fR, \fIDcell[2D]\fR, \fIDgrid[2D]\fR and
\fIDvect[2D]\fR
perform actions on or within the current window.  The border of the
current window (the window most recently chosen with \fIDchoose\fR) will
be highlighted in white by \fIDchoose\fR.  If the user points with the
mouse to an area which is the intersection of two overlapping windows,
\fIDchoose\fR will choose the window that was created earlier as the
current window.
.I Dchoose
can be given an argument to specify a window by its name.  For example,
the command:

.B "Dchoose full_screen"

can be used to choose the full screen as the current window.
Window names are printed to the screen when running such programs as
\fIDnew\fR, \fIDchoose\fR, and \fIDstatus\fR.
.I Dchoose
also has an interactive mode, if run without any arguments.  In this
case, the pointing device (mouse) is used to choose the window which
will act as the current window.  A menu indicates which actions
correspond with the use of each mouse button.
.SH NOTES
.I Dchoose
will not complain if no window yet exists to be chosen;  if this happens,
no action is taken by \fIDchoose\fR.
.sp
If the user runs \fIDchoose\fR without stipulating a window name on the
command line, \fIDchoose\fR will name the window. In general, this name
will be a pound sign followed by a number (e.g., \fI#3\fR).
.SH LIMITATIONS
Information in a window which is covered by another window is lost when
overwritten.
