.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBGsites\fR [-fw] \fIsitefile\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gsites
lists the locations of 
.CT points sites
that are contained in the GRASS site
.CT file map
named on the command line.  
.CT Point Site
locations are listed as
pairs of 
.XT grid 
coordinates in the form of eastings and northings
(in that order) that are separated by a single blank space.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -f
This option can be used to print a site description to the
right of each pair of site coordinates.
.IP -w
Ignore the current 
.CT window "geographic window"
and print all the sites. If -w is
not specified, only the sites in the current 
.CT window "geographic window"
are printed.
.SH "NOTES"
Note that output from the GRASS \fIGsites\fR command can be
redirected directly into \fIDpoints\fR. In this case, the -w option
should be specified to get the correct 
.CT graphics display
windowing.
