.I "(G Language Tool)"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Gpoly
.I "cell_file digit_file"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gpoly
scans the named \fIcell_file\fR and extracts lines which will separate it
into areas.

.I Gpoly
will create a vector 
.Ct "data file" map
from a given cell 
.CT "file." "map."
It will outline 
each unique area in the cell 
.CT file map
and create vector data to represent it.
The cell 
.CT values "category values"
will be used to create 
.CT attribute category
information for the resultant
vector areas.

.SH NOTES
.I Gpoly
extracts areas only.
.PP
You will need to run 
.I support.vect
on the resultant 
.CT files "vector map"
to build the dig_plus information.
