.SH NAME
Greclass \- Create new cell 
.CT layer map
based on existing cell 
.CT layer map
.br
.I (G Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Greclass
\fIinput_layer output_layer\fR [\fItitle\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Greclass
allows a user to create an \fIoutput\fR 
.CT "grid cell data layer" "cell map"
based on an
\fIinput\fR 
.CT "data layer." "cell map."
This output 
.CT layer "cell map"
will be a reclassification of the input 
.CT map "cell map"
based on \fIreclass\fR rules input to
.I Greclass.
A \fItitle\fR for the output 
.CT layer "cell map"
may be (optionally) specified on
the command line.
The reclass rules are read from standard input (i.e., from the keyboard,
redirected from a file, or piped through another program).
.SH RECLASS RULES
Once the user has specified an input 
.CT "file," "cell map,"
output 
.CT "file," "cell map," 
and (optionally)
output 
.CT layer "cell map"
title by typing
.br
\fBGreclass\fR \fIinput_layer output_layer title\fR
.br
each line of input must have the following format:

.RS
\fBinput_categories = output_category  [label]\fR
.RE

where \fIlist\fR specifies the 
.CT values "category values"
in the input 
.CT layer "cell map"
to be
reclassified to the \fInew\fR 
.CT "value." "category value." 
Specification of a \fIlabel\fR
to be associated with the new output 
.CT layer "cell map"
category is optional. If
specified it is recorded as the category label for the new 
.CT "value." "category value."
The equal sign \= is required. The \fIinput_category(ies)\fR may consist
of single category 
.CT numbers values
or a range of 
.CT numbers values
in the format "\fIlow\fR
thru \fIhigh\fR."
The word "thru" must be present.

A line containing only the word 
.B end
terminates the input.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following examples may help clarify the reclass rules.

.IP 1 3
This example reclassifies categories 1, 3 and 5 in the input 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
to category 1 with category label
"poor quality"
in the output 
.Ct "layer," "cell map,"
and reclassifies input 
.CT layer "cell map"
categories 2, 4, and 6
to category 2 with the label
"good quality"
in the output 
.CT "layer." "cell map."

.RS

.IP 2
This example reclassifies input 
.CT layer "cell map"
categories 1 thru 10 to output 
.CT layer "cell map"
category 1, input 
.CT layer "cell map"
categories 11 thru 20 to output 
.CT layer "cell map"
category 2,
and input 
.CT layer "cell map"
categories 21 thru 30 to output 
.CT layer "cell map"
category 3,
all without labels.

.IP 3
Subsequent rules override previous rules.  Therefore, the below example
reclassifies input 
.CT file "cell map"
categories 1 thru 19 and 51 thru 100 to category 1
in the output 
.CT "file," "cell map,"
input 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
categories 20 thru 24 and 26 thru 50 to
the output 
.CT layer "cell map"
category 2, and input 
.CT layer "cell map"
category 25 to the output
category 3.

.RS

20 thru 50	\&=	2	medium quality

.IP 4
The previous example could also have been entered as:

.ne 6
.RS
.RS
.TS
c l l l.
 1 thru 19  51 thru 100	\&=	1	poor quality
20 thru 24  26 thru 50	\&=	2	medium quality
25	\&=	3	good quality
.TE
.RE

or as:

.ne 6
.RS
.TS
c l l l.
 1 thru 19	\&=	1	poor quality
51 thru 100	\&=	1
20 thru 24	\&=	2
26 thru 50	\&=	2	medium quality
25	\&=	3	good quality
.TE
.RE

.LP
The final example was given to show how the labels are handled. If a new
.CT value "category value"
appears in more than one rule (as is the case with new 
.CT values "category values"
1 and 2)
the last label which was specified becomes the label for that category.
In this case the labels are assigned exactly as in the two previous
examples.
.SH BEWARE
A \fIreclass\fR file is not a true cell 
.CT "file." "map."
Rather, it is a table of
reclassification values which reference the input cell 
.CT file map
(see manual
entry \fIreclass[1]\fR for a detailed description of reclass files).
Therefore, users who wish to retain reclassified 
.CT maps "cell maps"
must also
save the original input 
.CT "map layers" "cell maps"
from which they were generated.

.CT Values "Category values"
which are not explicitly reclassified will be reclassified to 0.
.SH NOTES
To convert a reclass file to a regular cell 
.CT "file," "map,"
set your 
.CT window "geographic window"
to
match the header for the reclass file and then run resample.
