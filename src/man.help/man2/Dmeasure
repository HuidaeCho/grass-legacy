.TH Dmeasure 2D D-Language
.SH NAME
Dmeasure \- Tool used to measure feature lengths and areas
.br
.I (D Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBDmeasure\fR [forecolor\*=\fIcolor\fR] [backcolor\*=\fIcolor\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIDmeasure\fR provides the user with a way to measure the lengths and
areas of lines and polygons that the user has drawn on the monitor.
Lines and polygons are drawn using a pointing device (mouse).
A mouse button menu indicates that the user can find out the screen
coordinates of the cursor location, draw line segments between
user-specified vertices, and quit \fIDmeasure\fR.  Lines and polygons
are defined by the series of vertices marked by the user.  If more than
two successive vertices are drawn, \fIDmeasure\fR prints the area
encompassed (\fIDmeasure\fR will assume the area is closed even if the user
has not joined the first and last vertices).
Line lengths are stated in the same units as those of the current
database.  Areas are stated in both square miles and hectares.

Options that can be used with \fIDmeasure\fR are the foreground
and background colors of line segments drawn on the screen.
If these options are not stated on the commmand line, \fIDmeasure\fR
will default to the use of a foreground color of white, and a
background color of black.
.SH NOTES
The GRASS tool \fIdisplay\fR also offers a way to measure
line lengths and areas through its \fImeasurements\fR option.  If
the measurement program is run through \fIdisplay\fR, however,
default line segment foreground and background colors will be used.
