.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dlabel
allows the user to create and place text labels within the current window.
It interactively requests that the user type in text, and uses the pointing
device (mouse) to identify where this text is to be placed within the current
window.  Options can be stated on the command line.  If \fIDlabel\fR is
run without specified options, defaults are used.  Options are:
.ns
.TP 
.RI textcolor\*= color
Sets the color of the label text to that stated.  Options are red, orange,
green, blue, indigo, violet, black, white, gray, brown, indigo, magenta,
and yellow.  If the user states no color,
.I Dlabel
will default to the use of white lettering.
.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI backcolor\*= color
Sets the color of the label background (a rectangle on which the text sits)
to that stated.  Color options are the same as those for the \fItextcolor\fR.
If the user states no color, \fIDlabel\fR will default to the use of a black
background.
.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI size\*= number
Sets the label text size to the specified number.  Sizes are stated in
pixels.  Text size defaults to 3 pixels if unstated by the user.
.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI font\*= name
Sets the font in which text will be drawn to that stated.  Options are
stated by the GRASS tool \fIDshow.fonts\fR.
Roman type is used by default if none is specified by the user.
.PP
Options may be stated on the command line either positionally or
explicitly (see \fIDINTRO\fR).  If stated explicitly, they must
be stated in the order specified above.
.SH "NOTES"
The user can attempt to place a label on a screen location outside of
the current graphics window, but it will not appear when typed anywhere
outside of the current graphics window.
