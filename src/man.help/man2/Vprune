.SH NAME
Vprune \- Perform pruning on vector 
.CT file map
.br
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Vprune
.I input=if output=of thresh=threshold
.SH DESCRIPTION
The GRASS tool
.I Vprune
allows the user to remove extra points from a vector 
.CT "file." "map."
This allows one to reduce disk space required by a vector 
.CT file map
and
still have data accuracy within a given tolerance.
.br
The progam expects three command line arguments:  input, which is the
vector 
.CT file map
containing the data to be pruned, output, which is the 
resultant pruned 
.CT "data file." "vector map,"
and thresh, which is the threshold value
at which to prune.  This threshold value
is the same as the digit[1] pruning threshold.  This is specified in 
.CT database "data base"
units (e.g., in meters for UTM).  The threshold can also be
specified in inches on the map, and the program will convert these
to 
.CT database "data base"
units using the \fIscale\fR in the vector 
.CT "file." "map."
To differentiate
between the two, you must specifiy inches by typing the letter 'i' immediately
following the threshold value (e.g.,  0.04i).
The input 
.CT map "vector map"
will be read and the resultant pruned 
.CT map "vector map"
will be placed
into a newly created output 
.CT "map," "vector map,"
leaving the original 
.CT map "vector map"
unchanged.  The 
pruning algorithm throws away redundant points within the specified threshold.
It works on each 
.CT "digitized line" vector
separately, working from node to node.  It does
not change the position or number of nodes.
