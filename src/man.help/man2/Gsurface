Gsurface \- Surface generation tool

(G Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBGsurface input\fR\*=\fIname\fR \fBoutput\fR\*=\fIname\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIGsurface\fR fills a 
.CT "grid cell matrix" "cell map"
with interpolated 
.CT values "category values"
generated
from a set of irregularly spaced 
.CT "data points" "cells with non-zero category values"
using numerical
approximation (weighted averaging) techniques. The interpolated
.CT value "category value"
of a cell is determined by 
.CT values "the category values"
of nearby
.CT "data points" "cells with non-zero category values"
and the distance of the cell from those 
.CT "input points." "cells."
In comparison with other methods, numerical
approximation allows representation of more complex surfaces
(particularly those with anomalous features), restricts the spatial
influence of any errors, and generates the interpolated surface from the
.CT "data points." "input cell map."
It is the most appropriate method to apply to most spatial data.
.LP
The command line input is as follows:
.IP \fBinput\fR 8
.XT grid 
cell map that contains a set of irregularly spaced 
.CT "data values." "initial category values."
(i.e., some 
.XT grid 
cells contain known 
.CT data category
values while the rest
contain zero (0)).
.IP \fBoutput\fR
.XT grid 
cell map that represents a smooth surface generated from the known
.CT data category
values in the input 
.CT "layer." "cell map."
.SH NOTES
The amount of memory used by this program is related to the number of
non-zero 
.CT data category
values in the input 
.CT "map." "cell map."
If the input 
.CT map "cell map"
is very dense, ie, contains a lot of 
.CT "" "cells with"
non-zero 
.CT "data points," "category values"
the program may not be able to get all the memory it needs from the system.
The time required to execute increases with the number of 
.CT "input data points." "initial non-zero cells."
