Dsplit \- Divides the monitor into two windows and then displays two maps
.br
.I (D Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "Dsplit"
mapname1 mapname2 [cmd=GRASS command][cmd2=GRASS command] [view=horiz]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dsplit
is a UNIX Bourne shell macro which
clears the entire screen and divides it into two windows.
Maps are then displayed in each of the two windows.
This command is very useful for visually comparing maps
(cell, vector, 3D views) and can be used by other GRASS shell macros.
It is also useful for creating demos.
.SH Options:
.IP \fIview=horiz\fR 12
The screen can be split either horizontally or vertically.
The default view splits the screen into two screens, one on the left
and one on the right (vertical split).  Some maps ( 3D views) are better
represented with more width then height (horizontal split).  The first map
name listed on the command line will be displayed in the top or left window,
depending on whether the screen was split, horizontally or vertically.
The second map will be displayed in the bottom or right window.
.IP \fIcmd=\fR 12
The default command that displays the map is \fIDcell\fR, but it can be changed
to any GRASS command \fI(D3d, Dvect, etc...)\fR.
.IP \fIcmd2=\fR 12
This command will be executed for the second window only.
.sp
The way the commands \fI(cmd=, cmd2=)\fR work are if no commands are
given on the command line then the default command \fI(Dcell)\fR is executed
for both windows.
If only \fIcmd=\fR is listed on the command line then that command will be
executed for both windows.  If both \fIcmd=\fR and \fIcmd2=\fR are on the 
command line then the \fI(cmd=)\fR command is executed in window 1 and the
\fI(cmd2=)\fR command is executed in window 2.

.SH Notes
.IP
\fIDsplit\fR leaves the window that the last map was drawn in as the active
window.  The order in which the options \fI( cmd=, cmd2=, view=)\fR are placed
on the command line doesn't matter, but the order is important for the map
names.
