.SH NAME
Dsavescreen \- Screen capture utility
.br
.I (D Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Dsavescreen
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dsavescreen
captures the image on the graphics monitor for later painting by
the GRASS tool \fIPscreen\fR.
The image is captured in a file in /tmp. The name of the file in /tmp
is generated by \fIDsavescreen\fR and has the form /tmp/screen### (where ###
is a random number).
The capture is a two step process.
The image is first captured into a file, and the image is then reformatted
into the format required by \fIPscreen\fR.
The capture happens interactively. The reformatting goes on in the
background (i.e., the user can continue processing while waiting for the
image to be reformatted).
.I Dsavescreen
reports the name of the /tmp/screen### file after the first step is complete.
When the reformat step is completed, the user is notified by mail
that the /tmp/screen### file is complete.
.SH NOTES
The /tmp/screen### files can be quite large. Users should remove these files
after they have been painted.

This command may not exist on your system. At present, only
MASSCOMP systems have this command.
