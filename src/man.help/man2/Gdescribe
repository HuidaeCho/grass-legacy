.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Gdescribe
[-1rvw] \fIlayer\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gdescribe
examines a user-chosen grid cell data layer. The layer MUST be supplied on
the command line.
.sp 1
A compact list of category values that were found in the data layer
will be printed.
.sp 1
Following is a sample output:
.sp 1
.ti +.5i
0 2-4 10-13
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -1
Print the output one value per line, instead of the default short form.
In the above example, the -1 option would output:

.nf
.in +5
0
2
3
4
10
11
12
13
.in
.fi

.IP -r
Only print the range of the data.
The highest and lowest positive values, and the highest and lowest negative values
are output. In the above example, the -r option would output:

.nf
.in +5
0 2 13
.in
.fi

If the -1 option is also specified, the output is one per line.
.IP -v
Non-verbose. The -v option will tell Gdescribe to be silent while reading the
cell file. If not specified, it prints percentage completed messages.
.IP -w
Use the current window. Normally, Gdescribe will read the data layer directly,
ignoring both the current window and mask. The -w option tells Gdescribe to
read the data layer in the current window masked by the current mask (if any).
