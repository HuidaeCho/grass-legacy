Dwhat \- Interactive map queries

.I (D Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Dwhat
[\fIlayer1\fR] [\fIlayer2\fR] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dwhat 
is an
.I interactive
tool that allows the user, using the pointing device (mouse), to select
locations on the map in the current graphics window and then be shown what is
on this map layer or other map layers at the selected locations.
If no map layer names are specified on the command line, the map layer that is
displayed on the monitor in the current graphics window is queried by default.
Otherwise, the current graphics window is used for reference and the
map layers named on the command line are queried.

A single dash (\fB-\fR) following the command \fIDwhat\fR can be used as
shorthand to indicate the layer displayed in the current graphics window
(i.e., \fBDwhat -\fR).

\fIDwhat\fR output consists of the location pointed to, and, for each
map layer, the map layer name, the category number, and category label in
the grid cell(s) at this location.  Here is a sample \fIDwhat\fR session:

.RS
.B "Dcell soils"

.RS
(the soils map is displayed on the graphics monitor)
.RE

.B "Dwhat\ soils\ aspect"

.RS
(user moves the mouse to desired location on the displayed soils map, and
presses the left mouse button to query the soils and aspect maps
at this location)

.RS
.TS

617112.93(E) 3732014.66(N)
soils#(44) Nunn clay loam, NdC
aspect#(20) 15 degrees north of west
.TE
.RE

(The numbers in () are the category numbers. The category label follows.)
.RE
.RE

The query may be repeated as often as desired.  The right button on the mouse
is used to quit the
.I Dwhat
session.
.SH NOTES
.I Dwhat
will always print its output on the terminal screen.
\fIDwhat\fR output can also be redirected into a file.
In this case, the output will go both to the screen and to the file.
For example:

.RS
.B "Dwhat\ soils\ aspect > what.out"
.RE

will capture the output from
.I Dwhat
in the file \fIwhat.out\fR.

The maximum number of layers which can be queried at one time is 14.
