Mll2gc \- Converts geographic to geocentric coordinates

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mll2gc
returns geocentric coordinates for geographic coordinates (latitude and
longitude). Geographic coordinates are in degrees, minutes, and seconds
and must include designation of north or south {n\*|s} and east or
west {e\*|w}.  The spheroid on which they are based must also be
entered. The height (in meters) above the spheroid is optional.

The list of spheroids available is somewhat dynamic. It may not
contain exactly the ones listed below. To determine the current
list of possible spheroids, type in:

.ti +.5i
Mll2gc lat\*=0n lon\*=0w s\*=help

A list of available spheroids will be
printed on the screen. If the spheroid desired is not on the 
list, the values for the semi-major axis and the eccentricity
squared for the spheroid may be entered in place of a spheroid name in the
following format:

.ti +.5i
s\*=a\*=\fIsemi-major_axis\fR,e\*=\fIeccentricity_squared\fR

The distances designated by "x," "y" and "z" are in meters from the center
of the earth. Because the sample point is on the equator and is at 90 degrees
west, two of the three parameters have a value of zero (i.e., the point is
at the origin of those two dimensions).
.SH NOTES
For a brief discussion of spheroids see
.I Mll2u.

Geographic coordinates (lat/long) describe the location of a point on
the earth relative to the equator in the north/south directions
and relative to Greenwich in the east/west directions.
The same point will have different coordinates depending
on the spheroid used as the approximation of the shape of
the earth. The geocentric coordinates given here describe
the point on the basis of the same spheroid, but they
use the center of the spheroid as their origin. This can
be thought of as being the center of the earth, which is
why they are called "geocentric." Describing the location
of a point in a spheroid requires three points: x, y, and z; these
are measured out from the center along three different axes.
The distances given are in meters.

This is an experimental program. It is part of initial
efforts to incorporate geographic coordinates into GRASS.
