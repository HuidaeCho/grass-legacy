.TH Vpatch 1 Mapdev
.SH NAME
Vpatch \- Create a new vector map by combining other 
.CT maps "vector maps"
.br
.I (Mapdev tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Vpatch
\fIfile1 file2 ... composite_mapname\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vpatch
allows the user to combine any number of vector maps together to create
one composite 
.CT "map." "vector map."
The user must provide
the name of two or more vector maps to be combined, and the name of the new
composite 
.CT "map." "vector map."
.SH COMMENTS
The 
.CT files "vector maps"
to be patched must exist in the current mapset, and the composite
.CT map "vector map"
must not previously exist.
.sp
After running 
.I Vpatch
the header file will contain mostly information from
.I file1.
The 
.CT window "bounding box"
will be expanded to encompass all 
.CT windows "the bounding boxes"
and the scale will be 
the largest of all patched 
.CT maps "vector maps"
(this will affect default snapping thresholds).
The header will probably need to be edited;  this can be done from within the
GRASS program
.I digit.
.sp
Any 
.CT lines vectors
that are duplicated between 
.CT files "vector maps"
(e.g., border lines) will have to be
edited or removed.
.sp 
After running \fIVpatch\fR you will have to run \fIsupport.vect\fR on
the composite 
.CT file "vector map"
in order to create the dig_plus file.  At this time,
you can ask for a very small snapping threshold (1-5 meters) to cause
nodes that match up across 
.CT files "vector map"
to snap together, without affecting the
integrity of the remainder of the 
.CT "map." "vector map."
