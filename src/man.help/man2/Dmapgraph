.SH NAME
Dmapgraph \- Tool for generating simple graphics on maps
.br
.I (D Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Dmapgraph
[\fIname\fR [\fIcolor\fR]]
.br
.B Dmapgraph
[option\*=\fIvalue\fR] [option\*=\fIvalue\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dmapgraph 
draws graphics described in standard input (default) or the mapset file 
.I filename
if identified on the command line.  If commands are entered via standard
input, a \fIctrl-d\fR is used to signal the end of input to \fIDmapgraph\fR.
Options are:
.ns
.TP 
.RI name\*= file_name
Name of file containing graphics commands.  This is a UNIX file name;
specify the full pathname of the file.
If no file name is given, commands are taken from standard input.
.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI color\*= color
Starting color desired for graphics.  The default is white.
.br
.PP
\fIDmapgraph\fR is used for drawing simple graphics on top of a map.  
The coordinate system used by \fIDmapgraph\fR is that of the map that
is displayed on the graphics screen.
.PP
The graphics language is simple, using the following commands:
.ns
.TP 
.RI # comment
A line of comment which is ignored in the processing.
.br
.ns
.TP 
\fBmove\fR \fIxpos ypos\fR
The current location is updated to \fI(xpos,ypos)\fR (where the map coordinates
given fall within the window).  Default is window's center.
.br
.ns
.TP 
\fBdraw\fR \fIxpos ypos\fR
A line is drawn in the current color from the current location to the new
location
.I (xpos,ypos)
which becomes the current location.
.br
.ns
.TP 
\fBcolor\fR \fIcolor\fR
Sets the current color to that stated.  Options are red, orange, green, blue,
indigo, violet, black, white, gray, yellow, brown, indigo, and magenta.
.br
.ns
.TP 
\fBsize\fR \fIxper yper\fR
Subsequent text will be drawn such that the text is
.I xper
percent of the window wide and
.I yper
percent of the window high.
.br
.ns
.TP 
\fBtext\fR \fIline-of-text\fR
The stated text is drawn at the current location using the current color.
.br
.ns
.TP
\fBicon\fR \fItype size x y\fR
Draws an icon of types 0, x, or + with specified size at location x,y.

\fBpolygon\fR

The map coordinates appearing on lines beneath the word \fIpolygon\fR,
one pair per line, circumscribe a polygon which is to be filled with the
current color.
.SH "NOTES"
\fIDmapgraph\fR is identical to the \fIDgraph\fR command, except for the
difference in coordinate systems used.
.br
\fIDmapgraph\fR will complain if the user enters something to standard
input that it does not understand.
