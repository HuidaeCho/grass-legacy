.SH "NOTES"
This command is generally used for program debugging, and is not needed
by the casual user.
\fIDstatus\fR will complain if no graphics monitor has been selected for
output.
.br
If the user performs an action in a window that overwrites information
already there (i.e., the user runs \fIDcell\fR after having run
\fIDgrid\fR), the overwritten information will be lost in the \fIDstatus\fR
file as well.
