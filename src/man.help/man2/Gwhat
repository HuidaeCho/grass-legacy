.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gwhat 
is a
tool that allows the user to input one or more 
.CT "map points" "cell positions"
(i.e., pair of
eastings and northings),
and then be shown what is
on this 
.CT "map layer" "cell map"
or other 
.CT "map layers" "cell maps"
at the selected 
.CT "locations." "positions."

The input to
.I Gwhat
can be typed in at the keyboard, redirected from a file, or piped
from another program (such as
.I Gsites ).
Each line of the input consists of an easting and a northing and
an optional label. For example:

.RS
635342.21\ 7654321.09\ site 1
.br
653324.88\ 7563412.42\ site 2

.CT in for
the 
.XT grid 
cell(s) at this
