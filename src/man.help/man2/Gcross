.SH NAME
Gcross \- Creates a cross product of multiple cell files
.br	
.I (G Language Tool)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBGcross\fP [-vz] \fIlayer1\fP \fIlayer2\fP ... \fIresult\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gcross 
creates a
.I result
layer representing all unique comnbinations of values in the
input
.I layers.
At least two input layers must be specified.
The maximum number of input layers is 10.

For example, suppose that, using 2 data layers, the following combinations
occur:

.RS
.TS
ll
nn.
layer1	layer2
_
0	1
0	2
1	1
1	2
2	4
.TE
.RE

Gcross would result in a new data layer with 5 categories:

.RS
.TS
lll
nnn.
layer1	layer2	result
_
0	1	1
0	2	2
1	1	3
1	2	4
2	4	5
.TE
.RE

Note: the actual catagory assigned to a particular combination is
dependent on the order that the combinations occur in the data
and can be considered essentially random.
The example given here is for illustrative purposes.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Non-verbose. Supresses percent complete messages.
.IP -z
Non-zero data only. This means that if zero occurs in any data layer,
the combination is assigned the zero category, even if other data layers
contain non-zero data.
In the example given above,
-z would only generate 3 categories instead of 5.

If -z is not specified, then combinations which are
not all zero will get assigned a unique category.
.SH SUPPORT FILES
The category file created for the result layer describes the combinations
which generated each category. In the above example, the category labels
would be

.RS
.TS
ll
nl.
cat	label
_
1	layer1(0) layer2(1)
2	layer1(0) layer2(2)
3	layer1(1) layer2(1)
4	layer1(1) layer2(2)
5	layer1(2) layer2(4)
.TE
.RE

A random color table is also generated for the result layer.
