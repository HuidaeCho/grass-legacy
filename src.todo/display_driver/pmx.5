Hello Markus,

at the moment:

3 layers with null cells. Very sketchy (at least ;) "d.layers" tool. Only
rasters supported. (vectors will come soon). Ony d.rast patched. One leve=
l of
drawing "undo". You can actually draw **under** other maps (top maps must=
 have
null cells, indeed!). Controllable auto assignation of layers is under
brain storming operations.

The baby has 24 hours, now... Seems to grow quickly, though!=20

Have a good week-end!
Pierre.
